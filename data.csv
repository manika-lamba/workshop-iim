2-s2.0-70350618071,Article,"The definition of a system of care (SOC) can guide those intending to develop and sustain SOCs. Hodges, Ferreira, Israel, and Mazza [Hodges, S., Ferreira, K., Israel, N., & Mazza, J. (in press). Systems of care, featherless bipeds, and the measure of all things. Evaluation and Program Planning] have emphasized contexts in which services are provided to families, plus the adaptive, dynamic, complex nature of systems and multiple components that comprise SOCs. However, two areas need additional clarification: (1) the nature of the ""system"" of concern in a ""system of care,"" and how it should differ from a ""service delivery system""; and (2) the degree to which intended, or desired, outcomes of a SOC extend beyond increased access to ""necessary"" services and supports. These prime issues in the conceptualization of SOCs are addressed, drawing on ecological theory to underscore the need for broader systems - including factors in the proximal and distal contexts of children and families - to be engaged in the process of promoting well-being and helping children and families function and participate fully in their communities. A revised definition is proposed, with implications for the implementation of SOCs.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Psychology,2010.0
2-s2.0-70449117857,Article,"We use a model of continuous attachments in networks to generate propositions concerning inequalities in network structures, and test the propositions on data from organizational settings. Our network model, inspired by that of [Gould, Roger 2002. The origins of status hierarchies: A formal theory and empirical test. American Journal of Sociology 107, 1143-1178], is based on a theoretically informed actor model, in which each network member sets attachment strengths based on perceived partner quality, reciprocity, influence from others, attribute homophily, and attachment resistance. A computer algorithm finds the single robust equilibrium configuration of attachment strengths. This allows us to generate six propositions concerning inequalities at the individual, dyadic, triadic, and network levels. We test the propositions on network data for four kinds of attachments over four waves for five organizations, and find that the results generally support the propositions. The results suggest that partner quality, reciprocity, and attachment resistance are the most important elements in the network members' choices.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Sociology,2010.0
2-s2.0-70949105411,Article,"Previous research has consistently demonstrated a relationship between gang membership and involvement in illegal substances. In addition, researchers have noted that gang members are frequently more heavily involved in drug sales, which often lead to increases in violent behaviors. Most of this research, however, is either cross-sectional or ethnographic in nature, and therefore does not reveal the causal nature of these relationships. This research attempts to establish the temporal ordering of these relationships while controlling for a variety of relevant variables and to determine whether the relationships between drug involvement and violence differ for gang members versus nongang members. The findings indicate that gang membership is weakly associated with drug involvement, including both usage and sales. This involvement, however, does not appear to be related to assaults. Results suggest that gang membership is not determinative of drug involvement among a national random sample of youth.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Criminal Justice and Criminology,2010.0
2-s2.0-71149108277,Article,"The paper develops a North-Middle-South model to formulate a middle economy that plays catch-up via imitative R&D to acquire newer technologies from a higher-wage innovative forerunner, while playing ""reverse catch-up"" via outbound FDI to transfer older technologies to a lower-wage follower. A critical policy dilemma facing the middle economy is how to balance its R&D-driven technology inflows against its FDI-driven technology outflows. Numerical simulations are used for dynamic welfare analysis. This paper finds that tightening FDI permits the middle economy to keep a lower saving rate without weakening its ability to acquire newer technologies in the long run.",Business,Economics,2010.0
2-s2.0-72149125616,Article,"Isokinetic fatigue protocols have been used to determine the relative importance of lower extremity musculature to the maintenance of balance. However, these protocols are not representative of physical activity, thus the recommendations based on these findings may be inappropriate. Therefore, purpose of this investigation was to use a completely within subjects design to examine the effects of a functional ankle and hip fatigue protocol on postural control during single leg stance. All testing was completed in a health and wellness facility where 18 healthy recreationally active university students (nine female, nine male: 21.2 ± 1.96 years, 72.2 ± 17.8 kg, 170.4 ± 10.12 cm) volunteered to participate. Testing consisted of functionally fatiguing the ankle plantar flexors and dorsiflexors as well as the hip flexors and extensors. Postural control was assessed with two pre- and post-fatigue 20 s trials during single leg stance. Three measures of dynamic balance: the overall, medial/lateral, and anterior/posterior stability index were calculated using the Biodex Stability System at stability level 4. Three separate 2-way repeated measure ANOVAs indicated that fatigue of both the ankle (plantar flexors, dorsiflexors) and hip (flexors, extensors) musculature led to postural control impairments for the medial-lateral stability index (p < 0.01), and anterior-posterior stability index (p < 0.01). However, only ankle fatigue resulted in deficits in the overall stability index were (p < 0.01). Furthermore, neither fatigue protocol impaired single leg stance postural control more than the other (p > 0.05). Our results contradict previous isokinetic fatigue protocol findings, which indicate that proximal musculature fatigue results in greater postural control deficits.",CHHS,Kinesiology,2010.0

2-s2.0-73049113927,Article,"Changes in ankle mechanical stability in those with knee osteoarthritis. Objective: To examine ankle joint mechanical stability in patients who had mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis (OA). Design: Case control study. Setting: Biodynamics research laboratory. Participants: Subjects with knee OA (n=15; 5 men and 10 women; mean age ± SD, 60.3±10.2y; mean mass ± SD, 93.9±18.3kg; mean height ± SD, 167.23±9.5cm) were matched to healthy controls (n=15; 5 men and 10 women; mean age ± SD, 59.6±12.6y; mean mass ± SD, 83.5±19.2kg; mean height ± SD, 169.7±12.6cm). Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Mechanical ankle-subtalar joint stability was assessed with an instrumented arthrometer where ankle-subtalar joint motion for anterior/posterior displacement and inversion/eversion rotation was measured. Separate 2 × 2 mixed model analyses of variance were performed. Results: Significant group × side interactions were observed for anterior and posterior displacement (P<.05) where patients with knee OA had significantly less anterior and posterior ankle displacement compared with the control group, as well as compared with their unaffected extremity. Additionally, patients with knee OA had significantly (P<.05) less inversion/eversion rotation than their respective controls. Conclusions: These data suggest that altered ankle joint mechanics may be the result of deviations in ankle joint alignment secondary to the structural changes at the knee. Compensatory changes in ankle joint mechanics must also be considered when addressing lower extremity functional deficits in patients with knee OA.",CHHS,Kinesiology,2010.0
2-s2.0-73149084167,Article,"This article examines the role of stress in relation to heart disease self-care among African American women. Women described a unique stress-coping model: Stress was a cause and contributor to ""bad heart"" and associated with ""not worrying."" Family history of heart disease was used as an experiential reference scale to evaluate the severity of women's heart health. Stress attributions were associated with coping practices to manage the effect of illness through emotion-focused coping and with the physiological worsening of their condition. This model highlights opportunities to reframe stress-coping activities into culturally based heart-healthy practices for African American women.",CHHS,Public Health,2010.0
2-s2.0-73249138596,Article,"A vital quest in biology is comprehensible visualization and interpretation of correlation relationships on a genome scale. Such relationships may be represented in the form of networks, which usually require disassembly into smaller manageable units, or clusters, to facilitate interpretation. Several graph-clustering algorithms that may be used to visualize biological networks are available. However, only some of these support weighted edges, and none provides good control of cluster sizes, which is crucial for comprehensible visualization of large networks. We constructed an interactive coexpression network for the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) genome using a novel Heuristic Cluster Chiseling Algorithm (HCCA) that supports weighted edges and that may control average cluster sizes. Comparative clustering analyses demonstrated that the HCCA performed as well as, or better than, the commonly used Markov, MCODE, and k-means clustering algorithms. We mapped MapMan ontology terms onto coexpressed node vicinities of the network, which revealed transcriptional organization of previously unrelated cellular processes. We further explored the predictive power of this network through mutant analyses and identified six new genes that are essential to plant growth. We show that the HCCA-partitioned network constitutes an ideal ""cartographic"" platform for visualization of correlation networks. This approach rapidly provides network partitions with relative uniform cluster sizes on a genome-scale level and may thus be used for correlation network layouts also for other species.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2010.0
2-s2.0-73449086653,Article,"Despite the high incidence of chronic ankle instability (CAI), the underlying neurophysiologic mechanism is unknown. Evidence suggests that both feed-forward and feedback mechanisms may play a role. However, no investigation has examined both control mechanisms during the same movement task in the same cohort of CAI patients. PURPOSE: To determine the neuromuscular and biomechanical control alterations present in CAI patients during planned (feed-forward) and unplanned (feedback) gait termination. METHODS: Twenty subjects with CAI and 20 uninjured controls completed planned and unplanned gait termination protocols. Both tasks began with subjects walking at a self-selected speed across a 12-m walkway. Unplanned gait termination required subjects to stop during randomly selected trials on two adjacent force plates when cued. Planned gait termination required purposeful stopping on the force places. Propulsive and braking force magnitude and the dynamic postural stability index were calculated from the resulting ground reaction forces. In addition, muscle activity from the soleus, tibialis anterior, and gluteus medius was collected bilaterally. RESULTS: Both maximum propulsive (CAI = 99.8 ± 40.8 N, control = 88.6 ± 33.6 N) and braking (CAI = 207.1 ± 80.9 N, control = 161.6 ± 62.2 N) forces were significantly higher in the CAI group. The dynamic postural stability index revealed higher scores in the CAI group (0.24 ± 0.03) compared with the control group (0.22 ± 0.03). Muscle activation of the soleus and tibialis anterior differed during unplanned and planned gait termination between groups (P < 0.05) and between the limbs of the CAI group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Altered biomechanical strategies during both planned and unplanned gait termination indicate that patients with CAI have alterations in feed-forward neuromuscular control and suggest the presence of feedback neuromuscular control deficits.",CHHS,Kinesiology,2010.0
2-s2.0-73549107666,Article,"This study contributes to our understanding of leadership in public sector organizations by investigating the effect of organizational structure on the transformational leadership practices of municipal chief administrative officers. Using data from a national survey of senior managers in local government, the findings of this study suggest a number of possible explanations for why public sector organizations exhibit higher levels of transformational leadership than what scholars traditionally expect. Our findings suggest that the structure of these organizations may not be as bureaucratic as commonly believed and that some bureaucratic characteristics had little, if any, adverse affect on the prevalence or practice of transformational leadership behaviors. In particular, although organizational hierarchy and inadequate lateral/upward communication were associated with lower transformational leadership, no relationship was found between transformational leadership behaviors and two types of organizational red tape. Contrary to expectations in the mainstream leadership literature, however, the use of performance measurement by municipal organizations was associated with a significant increase in reported transformational leadership behaviors.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Political Science and Public Administration,2010.0
2-s2.0-73649095510,Article,"Several studies have reported that traumatic brain injury (TBI) has a smaller effect on neuropsychological test scores, in contrast to the large effect of poor effort on test performance. Consequently, many authors have concluded that effort needs to be measured routinely and that it is necessary to control for poor effort when measuring the effects of brain disease or injury on performance. Recently, however, Bowden, Shores, and Mathias (2006) have challenged these notions. They argued that the Immediate Recognition subtest of the Word Memory Test (Green Flaro, 2003), an effort measure, is another verbal memory test rather than a measure of cognitive effort. In this study we re-examine the data from Bowden et al. (2006) and Green, Rohling, Lees-Haley, and Allen (2001) to identify differences between the two studies that might account for their contradictory conclusions. In both sets of data, reanalysis showed that effort explains approximately five times more of the variance in composite neuropsychological test scores than TBI severity. Importantly, scores on the Word Memory Test-Immediate Recognition (WMT-IR) were not correlated with measures of TBI severity, and were not found to correlate with major variables known to be measuring ability (e.g., years of education). These findings challenge the conclusions offered by Bowden and colleagues (2006).",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Psychology,2010.0

2-s2.0-73849089270,Article,"This paper focuses on the assignment of N discrete points among K geometrically constrained robots and determination of the order in which the points should be processed by the robots. This path planning problem is directly motivated by an industrial laser drilling system with two robots that are constrained to translate along a common line while satisfying collision avoidance constraints. The points lie on a planar base plate that translates normal to the axis of motion of the robots. The geometric constraints on the motions of the robots lead to constraints on points that can be processed simultaneously. We use a two step approach to solve the path planning problem: 1) Splitting Problem: Assign the points to the K robots, subject to geometric constraints, to maximize parallel processing of the points. 2) Ordering Problem: Find an order of processing the split points by formulating and solving a multidimensional Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) in the K-tuple space with an appropriately defined metric to minimize the total travel cost. For K = 2, we solve the splitting problem optimally in O(N3) time by converting it to a maximum cardinality matching problem. Since this is too slow for large datasets, we also provide a greedy O(N log N) algorithm. We provide computational results showing that the greedy algorithm solution is very close to the optimal solution for large datasets. For the ordering problem we present local search based heuristics to improve the multidimensional TSP tour. We give computational results for the ordering problem and for the overall performance gain obtained (over a single robot system) by using our algorithm. Finally, we extend our approach to a K-robot system and give computational results for K = 4. Note to Practitioners-This paper presents techniques to plan the motions of multiple robots to visit and process a given set of points, subject to geometric constraints on the robot motions. This point set coverage task is motivated by a laser drilling application for electronics manufacturing. The goal is to minimize the time taken to visit the points by parallelizing the robot operations while avoiding robot collisions. Similar tasks arise in many applications including drilling, electronics manufacturing, circuit testing, spot welding, and sensor network data collection. We model the assignment of points in the plane to robots as a matching problem and the point traversal order generation as a Traveling Salesman Problem. We present effective algorithms to plan the motions of the robots for large data sets (involving hundreds of thousands of points), and demonstrate the feasibility of our approach for 2 and 4 robots.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2010.0

In this chapter, state of the art acoustic features for timbre automatic indexing are explored to construct efficient classification models, such as decision tree and KNN. The authors built a database containing more than one million music instrument sound slices, each described by a large number of features including standard MPEG7 audio descriptors, features for speech recognition, and many new audio features developed by the authors, spanning from temporal space to spectral domain. Each classification model was tuned with feature selection based on its distinct characteristics for the blind sound separation system. Based on the experimental results, authors proposed a new framework for MIR with multiple classifiers trained on different features. Inspired by the human recognition experience, timbre estimation based on the hierarchical structure of musical instrument families was investigated. A framework for timbre automatic indexing based on Cascade Classification System was proposed.

2-s2.0-73949090063,Article,"Latino immigrants have unique stressors that can influence mental health. The challenges of adapting to a new society include language barriers, separation from family, and feelings of loss, which can lead to depression. Low health literacy may make it difficult to obtain health care services, and depression may then go untreated. This secondary data analysis examined the relationships of immigration demands, health literacy, and depression in a sample of recent Latino immigrants. Depressive symptoms were a significant problem; 26% of the participants reported symptoms that were suggestive of depression. Furthermore, low health literacy and greater immigration demands predicted higher depression scores. The study suggests that recent Latino immigrants would benefit from health literacy training, education on depressive symptoms, and better access to mental health services. Latinos who do access health care services need to be screened for depression; furthermore, home health care nurses can promote access to support and health care services.",CHHS,Nursing,2010.0

2-s2.0-74049158261,Article,"Hierarchical classifiers are usually defined as methods of classifying inputs into defined output categories. The classification occurs first on a low-level with highly specific pieces of input data. The classifications of the individual pieces of data are then combined systematically and classified on a higher level iteratively until one output is produced. This final output is the overall classification of the data. In this paper we follow a controlled devise type of approach. The initial group of classifiers is trained using all objects in an information system S partitioned by values of the decision attribute d at its all granularity levels (one classifier per level). Only values of the highest granularity level (corresponding granules are the largest) are used to split S into information sub-systems where each one is built by selecting objects in S of the same decision value. These sub-systems are used for training new classifiers at all granularity levels of its decision attribute. Next, we split each sub-system further by sub-values of its decision value. The obtained tree-structure with groups of classifiers assigned to each of its nodes is called a cascade classifier. Given an incomplete information system with a hierarchical decision attribute d, we consider the problem of training classifiers describing values of d at its lowest granularity level. Taking MIRAI database of music instrument sounds [16], as an example, we show that the confidence of such classifiers can be lower than the confidence of cascade classifiers.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2010.0

We look at evidence for a group of 13 OECD countries, and consider three alternative measures of inflationary pressure, including the output gap, labor share, and unemployment. We find that the SPI model is preferable to the Calvo SP and the SI models because it captures the type of strong inflationary persistence that has in the past characterized the economies in our sample. However, two caveats to this conclusion are that improvement in performance is driven mostly by lagged inflation and that the SPI model overemphasizes inflationary persistence. There appears to be room for improvement in all models in order to induce them to better 'track' inflation persistence.",Business,Economics,2010.0

2-s2.0-74549126013,Article,"Background: Hispanics are the largest and fastest growing minority group in the United States. Charlotte, NC, had the 4th fastest growing Hispanic community in the nation between 1990 to 2000. Gaining understanding of the patterns of health care use for this changing population is a key step toward designing improved primary care access and community health. Methods: The Multiple Attribute Primary Care Targeting Strategy process was applied to key patient- and community-level attributes describing the Charlotte Hispanic community. Maps were created based on socioeconomic status, population density, insurance status, and use of the emergency department as a primary care safety net. Each of these variables was weighed and added to create a single composite map. Results: Individual attribute maps and the composite map identified geographic locations where Hispanic community members would most benefit from increased access to primary care services. Conclusions: Using the Multiple Attribute Primary Care Targeting Strategy process we were able to identify geographic areas within our community where many Hispanic immigrants face barriers to accessing appropriate primary care services. These areas can subsequently be targeted for interventions that improve access to primary care and reduce emergency department use. The geospatial model created through this process can be monitored over time to determine the effectiveness of these interventions.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2010.0

Geographic information systems (GIS) have the potential to assess patterns of health care utilization and community-level attributes to identify geographic regions most in need of primary care access. Methods: GIS, analytical hierarchy process, and multiattribute assessment and evaluation techniques were used to examine attributes describing primary care need and identify areas that would benefit from increased access to primary care services. Attributes were identified by a collaborative partnership working within a practice-based research network using tenets of community-based participatory research. Maps were created based on socioeconomic status, population density, insurance status, and emergency department and primary care safety-net utilization. Results: Individual and composite maps identified areas in our community with the greatest need for increased access to primary care services. Conclusions: Applying GIS to commonly available community- and patient-level data can rapidly identify areas most in need of increased access to primary care services.

2-s2.0-75149161750,Article,"We study a drop-shipping supply chain in which the retailer receives a customer's order and the supplier fills it. In such a chain, the supplier keeps inventory and bears inventory risks; the retailer focuses on marketing and customer acquisition, and forwards the orders to the supplier. The retailer usually has better customer demand information, and may send an over-estimated demand forecast to maximize her own interest, which may result in overstock for the supplier. On the other hand, since the retailer does not own inventory, the main concern of the retailer is that the acquired orders may not be fulfilled because of the supplier's shortage of stock. To cope with these challenges, we propose a menu of commitment-penalty contracts that can provide greater certainty of demand as well as greater certainty of supply. We focus our study in the asymmetric demand information case and we show that the supplier can obtain the retailer's demand information by offering a menu of commitment-penalty contracts. Under this mechanism, we find the solution that maximizes the supplier's expected profit.",Business,Management,2010.0
2-s2.0-75149186003,Article,"Studies suggest that students who participate in extracurricular activities benefit in a number of ways. However, schools provide different opportunities to participate in these activities. Using information from high school yearbooks and administrative data on students and schools in North Carolina, we examine whether school characteristics influence the numbers and types of extracurricular activities available, whether schools providing more and diverse activities have higher participation rates, and whether these schools have better academic outcomes. We find that school size and poverty levels significantly influence the number and types of activities available, with larger schools and those schools with more affluent student bodies offering more activities. In addition, schools with more activities available tend to have higher participation rates. Opportunities to participate are associated with positive academic outcomes for the school, even when controlling for school resources. For some-but not all-activities, student participation rates mediate the relationship between activity availability and the school's academic profile. For benefits to be present, schools must provide these resources, and students must invest in them.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Sociology,2010.0

2-s2.0-75649085627,Article,"The purpose of this investigation was to compare dynamic postural control and mechanical ankle stability among patients with and without chronic ankle instability (CAI) and controls. Seventy-two subjects were divided equally into three groups: uninjured controls, people with previous ankle injury but without CAI, and people with CAI. Subjects completed a single-leg hop-stabilization task, and then had an anterior drawer test and lateral ankle radiograph performed bilaterally. The dynamic postural stability index was calculated from the ground reaction forces of the single-leg hop-stabilization task. Ankle joint stiffness (N/m) was measured with an instrumented arthrometer during the anterior drawer test, and fibula position was assessed from the radiographic image. Patients with previous ankle injuries but without CAI demonstrated higher frontal plane dynamic postural stability scores than both the uninjured control and CAI groups (P<0.01). Patients with and without CAI had significantly higher sagittal plane dynamic postural stability scores (P<0.01) and increased ankle joint stiffness (P=0.045) relative to the control group. The increased frontal plane dynamic postural control may represent a component of a coping mechanism that limits recurrent sprains and the development of CAI. Mechanical stability alterations are speculated to result from the initial ankle trauma.",CHHS,Kinesiology,2010.0

A sample of 1351 adults who had completed the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI) in previous studies provided the basis for item selection. The resulting 10- item form includes two items from each of the five subscales of the original PTGI, selected on the basis of loadings on the original factors and breadth of item content. A separate sample of 186 completed the short form of the scale (PTGISF). Confirmatory factor analyses on both data sets demonstrated a five-factor structure for the PTGI-short form (PTGI-SF) equivalent to that of the PTGI. Three studies of homogenous clinical samples (bereaved parents, intimate partner violence victims, and acute leukemia patients) demonstrated that the PTGI-SF yields relationships with other variables of interest that are equivalent to those found using the original form of the PTGI. A final study demonstrated that administering the 10 short-form items in a random order, rather than in the fixed context of the original scale, did not impact the performance of the PTGI-SF. Overall, these results indicate that the PTGI-SF could be substituted for the PTGI with little loss of information.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Psychology,2010.0

Causal variables pertaining to each data category could be site specific but have been shown to correlate with runoff pollutant loads. These data categories were combined to derive statistical relationships for characterization and prioritization of the respective pollutant loads at highway runoff sites. Storm runoff data of total suspended solids (TSS), total dissolved solid (TDS), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) and total phosphorus (TP) collected from three highway sites in Charlotte, North Carolina, USA, were used to illustrate the development of site-specific highway-runoff pollutant loading models. This unified methodology provides a basis for initial assessment of the pollutant-constituent loads from highway runoff using hydrologic component variables. Improved reliability is achievable when additional traffic and/or atmospheric component variables are incorporated into the basic hydrologic regression model.

The breadth of its productoffering has helped the company achieve unparalleled marketreach; however, ithas come with significant costs and challenges. By offering multiple similar products, a manufacturer increases its overall demand volatility, reduces forecast accuracy, and can adversely affect revenue and costs across the entire product life cycle. At HP, these impacts included increases in inventory-driven costs and order-cycle time; liabilities to channel partners; and costs of operations, research and development, marketing, and administration. Furthermore, complexity in HP's product lines confused customers, sales representatives, and channel partners, sometimes driving business to competitors. HP developed two powerful operations research-based solutions for managing product variety. The first, a framework for screening new products, uses custom-built return-on-investment (ROI) calculators to evaluate each proposed new product before introduction; those that do not meet a threshold ROI level are targeted for exclusion from the proposed lineup. The second, HP's Revenue Coverage Optimization (RCO) tool, which is based on a fast, new maximum-flow algorithm, is used to manage product variety after introduction.

Consistent with Gottfredson's (2004) [Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 86, 174-199.] hypotheses, some of the apparent associations between racial composition and health outcomes were accounted for by IQ differences. When IQ was controlled, some of the relationships between racial composition and health outcomes reversed signs suggesting an advantage for minorities. However, even after controlling for average IQ and wealth factors, racial composition continued to be associated with some of the health statistics examined.

There is a recognized need for a systematic mechanism to prioritize community health issues in objective, data-driven, quantifiable measures. This exploratory study examined the extent to which data-driven objective criteria were considered important to public health officials in North Carolina and, specifically, the extent to which they chose between objective and subjective criteria in establishing public health priorities. The differences between the health officers' practice (criteria they actually used) and their preferences (criteria thought to be important) were also assessed. It was found that NC health directors generally used subjective criteria more often than objective criteria when deciding on the most important health issues in their communities. A considerable segment of the respondents, however, considered objective criteria more important, even though subjective criteria were the dominant influence in their actual practice of priority setting. Our preliminary results suggest that officers' education and tenure may influence their practice and preferences.

2-s2.0-77549088705,Article,"Here we document for the first time in detail a natural landscape dominated by granular disintegration of marble and the associated production of marble grus sediment and corestones. We provide several lines of evidence for a thermal-mechanical origin for the observed granular disintegration and resulting corestones. In the San Bernardino Mountains of southern California, calcite marble outcrops whose average grain diameter is greater than approximately 0.5 mm are weathering into grus sediment and exhibit a corestone morphology. Minimal soil development in thick grus colluvium combined with results from a simple erosion experiment indicates that grus production and erosion is rapid. Our data indicate that unlike granite, marble granular disintegration and corestone development is a uniquely sub-aerial process. Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope (ESEM) and micro-probe analyses of rock samples collected in recent quarry exposures indicate that detachment of grain boundaries occurs primarily within the upper 2-20 cm of the outcrop surface. There is minimal evidence of secondary calcite dissolution or precipitation at grain boundaries below the upper-most few centimeters of the rock surface, despite widespread intergranular fracturing. At depths greater than 20 cm below the natural ground surface, granular disintegration and corestone weathering are not evident, and dissolution and precipitation of secondary calcite is only observed within a few centimeters of joint planes. Corestone morphology appears to form through the erosion of loosened grus debris at sharp edges of subaerially exposed joints. The resulting form represents a morphologic equifinality to that of granite corestones and results from different processes than those which have been proposed for granite. An 8-month, once-per-three minute temperature record from a thermocouple embedded into a marble corestone indicates that the upper 2.5 cm of the corestone regularly achieves temperatures greater than 40 °C, the temperature which is thought to be sufficient to produce permanent strain in calcite. All of these results are consistent with theoretical and experimental studies that indicate that marble is susceptible to mechanical weathering by thermal processes. Overall, this study provides new documentation that solar heating and cooling can be an important driver of physical weathering in natural systems of the Earth's surface.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2010.0

In Experiment 1, we used a 3-day (20 min/d) mindfulness meditation intervention and measured pain ratings before and after the intervention. Participants' numerical ratings of pain to ""low"" and ""high"" electrical stimulation significantly decreased after meditation training. Pain sensitivity, measured by change in stimulus intensity thresholds, also decreased after training. We investigated, in Experiment 2, how well relaxation and a math distraction task attenuated experimental pain. Math distraction but not relaxation reduced high pain ratings. There was no reduction in pain sensitivity in these participants. In Experiment 3, we directly compared the effects of meditation with math distraction and relaxation conditions. Our findings indicated significant effects of both meditation and math distraction. Consistent with what was observed in Experiment 1, these participants also demonstrated a decrease in pain sensitivity after meditation training. Changes in the mindfulness and anxiety assessments suggest that meditation's analgesic effects are related to reduced anxiety and the enhanced ability to focus on the present moment.

We often need to compare TFBS motifs using their PFMs in order to search for similar motifs in a motif database, or cluster motifs according to their binding preference. The majority of current methods for motif comparison involve a similarity metric for column-to-column comparison and a method to find the optimal position alignment between the two compared motifs. In some applications, alignment-free methods might be preferred; however, few such methods with high accuracy have been described. Methodology/Principal Findings:Here we describe a novel alignment-free method for quantifying the similarity of motifs using their PFMs by converting PFMs into k-mer vectors.

These epidemiological asymmetries can result in apparent competition, where a highly infectious host reduces the abundance of less infectious or more susceptible members in a community via a shared pathogen. We show that the exotic pathogen Phytophthora ramorum and resulting disease, sudden oak death, cause apparent competition among canopy trees and that transmission differences among canopy trees drives patterns of disease severity in California coast redwood forests. P. ramorum ranges in its ability to infect, sporulate on, and cause mortality of infected hosts. A path analysis showed that the most prolific inoculum producer, California bay laurel (Umbellularia californicd), had a greater impact on the mortality rate of tanoak (Lithocarpus densiflorus) than did other inoculum-supporting species. In stands experiencing high tanoak mortality, lack of negative impacts by P. ramorum on bay laurel may increase bay laurel density and subsequently result in positive feedback on pathogen populations. This study demonstrates the degree to which invasive, generalist pathogens can cause rapid changes in forest canopy composition and that differences in transmission can be more important than susceptibility in driving patterns of apparent competition.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2010.0

In recent years, articles have appeared in business publications alleging abuse of the discretion afforded to management in setting pension rates, particularly the pension discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets. We find that pension discount rate estimates and expected rate of return estimates generally comply with the authoritative requirements, although there appears to be a smoothing effect in setting pension discount rates as well as a lag in fully reflecting economic conditions. We find evidence consistent with discount rate choice being influenced by deteriorating economic conditions, and possibly passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We also find that, in general, firms' expected rate of return assumptions tend to reflect their long-run internal rates of return on pension assets, although the recessionary influences in the early 2000s were not fully reflected in the expected rates of return toward the end of our test period.

Many of these models induce PE with intravenous injection of exogenous impervious objects that may not completely reproduce the physiological properties of autologous thromboembolism. Current literature lacks a simple, well-described rat model of autlogous PE. Objective: Test if moderate-severity autologous PE in Sprague-Dawley (SD) and Copenhagen (Cop) rats can produce persistent PH.Methods: blood was withdrawn from the jugular vein, treated with thrombin-Ca++and re-injected following pretreatment with tranexamic acid. Hemodynamic values, clot weights and biochemical measurements were performed at 1 and 5 days.Results: Infusion of clot significantly increased the right ventricular peak systolic pressure to 45-55 mm Hg, followed by normalization within 24 hours in SD rats, and within 5 days in COP rats. Clot lysis was 95% (24 hours) and 97% (5 days) in SD rats and was significantly lower in COP rats (70%, 24 hours; 87% 5 days). Plasma D-dimer was elevated in surgical sham animals and was further increased 8 hours after pulmonary embolism. Neither strain showed a significant increase in bronchoalveolar chemotactic activity, myeloperoxidase activity, leukocyte infiltration, or chemokine accumulation, indicating that there was no significant pulmonary inflammation.Conclusions: Both SD and COP rats exhibited near complete fibrinolysis of autologous clot PE within 5 days.

Numerous approaches on acoustic feature extraction have already been proposed for timbre recognition. Unfortunately, none of these monophonic timbre estimation algorithms can be successfully applied to polyphonic sounds, which are more usual cases in the real music world. This has stimulated the research on a hierarchically structured cascade classification system under the inspiration of the human perceptual process. This cascade classification system makes first estimate on the higher level of the decision attribute, which stands for the musical instrument family. Then, the further estimation is done within that specific family range. However, the traditional hierarchical structures were constructed in human semantics, which are meaningful from human perspective but not appropriate for the cascade system. We introduce the new hierarchical instrument schema according to the clustering results of the acoustic features. This new schema better describes the similarity among different instruments or among different playing techniques of the same instrument. The classification results show a higher accuracy of cascade system with the new schema compared to the traditional schemas.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2010.0

2-s2.0-77950002201,Conference Paper,"Digital microfluidic systems (DMFS) are a class of lab-on-a-chip systems that manipulate individual droplets of chemicals on an array of electrodes. The biochemical analyses are performed by repeatedly moving, mixing, and splitting droplets on the electrodes. In this paper, we characterize the tree structure of biochemical analyses and identify their minimum resource requirements, towards the design of cost and space-efficient biochips. Mixers and storage units are two primary functional resources on a DMFS biochip; mixers mix and split droplets while storage units store droplets on the chip for subsequent processing. Additional DMFS resources include input and output units and transportation paths. We present an algorithm to compute, for a given number of mixers M, the minimum number of storage units f(M) for an input analysis using its tree structure, and design a corresponding scheduling algorithm to perform the analysis. We characterize the variation of the M-depth of a tree (i.e., its minimum number of storage units f(M)) with M, and use it to calculate the minimum total size (the number of electrodes) of mixers and storage units. We prove that the smallest chip for an arbitrary analysis uses one mixer and f(1) storage units. Finally, we demonstrate our results on two example biochemical analyses and design the smallest chip for a biochemical analysis with a complete tree structure of depth 4. These are the first results on the least resource requirements of DMFS for biochemical analyses, and can be used for the design and selection of chips for arbitrary biochemical analyses.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2010.0

The purpose of this study was to examine the associations of victimization experiences in childhood and adulthood with functional status and illness severity in a sample of patients with CFS using longitudinal data. In the sample of 93 patients with CFS, childhood abuse and neglect had greater impact than adulthood victimization. Overall, victimization experiences in childhood demonstrated modest associations with clinical outcomes in CFS, although several victimization experiences were in the opposite direction of expectations.

2-s2.0-77950211848,Article,Does respect for human rights check or promote terrorism? This question is hotly debated within policy circles. Some hold that restricting human rights is a necessary if unfortunate cost of preventing terrorism. Others conclude that such abuses aggravate political grievances that contribute to terror. The authors demonstrate that theory and data support the latter position. They hypothesize that abuse of the subset of rights known as physical integrity rights fuels terrorism by making it more difficult for government authorities to collect intelligence on terrorists and by undermining domestic and international support for their counterterrorism efforts. They test this hypothesis using a data set that includes measures of both domestic and transnational terrorist attacks and find that respect for physical integrity rights is consistently associated with fewer terrorist attacks. This suggests that those interested in curtailing terrorism should press governments to more carefully respect physical integrity rights.,Liberal Arts and Sciences,Political Science and Public Administration,2010.0

Similar to other studies of the reaction to this Act, we observe that investors consider the FSM to be good news. More interestingly, we also observe that systematic risk increased for some types of firms, but decreased for others as barriers were lowered. This finding is consistent with the idea that the reduction of regulation may increase systematic risk, but that the effects of deregulation on risk may be mitigated by anticipated effects of diversification. Specifically, bank holding companies that chose to diversify into other financial industries experienced increases in systematic risk while those that did not diversify realized decreases in systematic risk. Overall, we find that the systematic risk of financial firms converged and increased in the past few years as firms expanded into non-traditional businesses. In addition, we find that the Act reduced systematic risk for some firms, specifically those that diversified their product lines with insurance products.",Business,Finance,2010.0

Subjects also performed 3 10-minute submaximal exercise bouts on the ECT and ARC at 55%, 65%, and 75% of TML maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) in which heart rate (HR), VO2, ventilation, respiratory exchange ratio, and hip, knee, and low-back discomfort were monitored. All testing on the ECT and ARC were performed in a counterbalanced order. The VO2max was greater during TML exercise compared with ECT (p = 0.007) but similar to the ARC. Both ECT and ARC elicited lower maximal HR values compared with maximal TML exercise (p = 0.0001). No difference was observed between ECT and ARC for VO2 during the submaximal exercise bouts (p &gt; 0.05). However, HR was greater during submaximal ECT exercise (p &lt; 0.0001). Perception of discomfort was not different between ECT and ARC for knees (p &gt; 0.05) and lower back (p &gt; 0.05) but different for the hips (p = 0.02).

2-s2.0-77950881528,Article,"With the continuing influx of large numbers of immigrants to the United States, urban labor market segmentation along the lines of race, ethnicity, gender, and class has drawn considerable attention. Using a confidential data set extracted from the United States Decennial Long Form Data 2000 and a multilevel regression modeling strategy, this article presents a case study of Chinese immigrants in the San Francisco metropolitan area. Correspondent with the highly segregated nature of the labor market between Chinese immigrant men and women, different socioeconomic characteristics at the census tract level are significantly related to their occupational segregation. The results of this study suggest that the social process of labor market segmentation is contingent on the immigrant geography of residence and workplace. Whereas the direction and magnitude of the spatial contingency are different between men and women, residency in Chinese immigrant-concentrated areas is perpetuating gender occupational segregation by skill level. Abundant ethnic resources might exist in ethnic neighborhoods and enclaves for certain types of employment opportunities; however, these resources do not necessarily help Chinese immigrant workers, especially women, to move upward in the labor market hierarchy.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2010.0

2-s2.0-77950955076,Article,"We examine the use of consumer cash mail-in rebates offered by a manufacturer in a Stackelberg game where the manufacturer is the leader and the retailer is the follower. Our analysis indicates that rebates are profitable for manufacturers if consumers are inconsistent in the sense that their rebate valuation when they make purchase decisions is independent of their redemption probabilities when they make redemption decisions. If the manufacturer keeps the wholesale price unchanged, then the rebate increases the retailer's profit by a larger amount than the increase in the manufacturer's profit. If the manufacturer jointly optimizes the wholesale price and rebate, then the increase in the manufacturer's profit is twice the increase in the retailer's profit. The retailer responds to rebates by increasing the retail price, which increases the margin paid by consumers who do not redeem the rebate. On average, consumer surplus decreases when it is optimal for manufacturers to offer rebates. We suggest incentive schemes that make it worthwhile for retailers to limit the price increase. In these incentive schemes, the manufacturer imposes a negative relationship between the rebate value and the retail price. We show that such incentives increase supply chain profits.",Business,BISOM,2010.0

2-s2.0-77951178541,Article,"Significant interaction challenges arise in both developing and using interactive map applications. Users encounter problems of information overload in using interactive maps to complete tasks. This is further exacerbated by device limitations and interaction constraints in increasingly popular mobile platforms. Application developers must then address restrictions related to screen size and limited bandwidth in order to effectively displaymaps onmobile devices. In order to address issues of user information overload and application efficiency in interactive map applications, we have developed a novel approach for delivering personalized vectormaps. Ongoing task interactions between users and maps are monitored and captured implicitly in order to infer individual and group preferences related to specific map feature content. Personalized interactive maps that contain spatial feature content tailored specifically to users' individual preferences are then generated. Our approach addresses spatial information overload by providing only the map information necessary and sufficient to suit user interaction preferences, thus simplifying the completion of tasks performed with interactivemaps. In turn, tailoring map content to specific user preferences considerably reduces the size of vector data sets necessary to transmit and render maps on mobile devices. We have developed a geographic information system prototype, MAPPER (MAP PERsonalization), that implements our approach. Experimental evaluations show that the use of personalized maps helps users complete their tasks more efficiently and can reduce information overload.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2010.0

However, bilateral balance impairments are a viable reason for previous non-significant findings between involved and uninvolved limbs. The purpose of this investigation was to conduct a meta-analysis on studies reporting the effects of lateral ankle trauma on balance of the involved and uninvolved limb after acute ankle injury and chronic ankle instability. Twelve studies qualified for inclusion and assessed static balance for both the involved and uninvolved limbs post-injury and a control group. Meta-analyses calculated standardized mean difference effects and explored moderating variables for the involved and uninvolved limbs relative to controls. A significant cumulative effect size (ES = 0.448, p<0.00001) indicated that balance of the involved limb is impaired after a history of ankle injury. Moderator variable analysis revealed that both acute (ES = 0.529, p<0.0002) and chronic (ES = 0.338, p<0.001) lateral ankle trauma negatively affected balance. Analysis of the uninvolved limb also revealed postural stability impairments (ES = 0.275, p<0.003). Additional, moderator analysis showed a significant acute effect (ES = 0.564, p<0.0001), but failed to find significance for individuals with chronic ankle instability (ES = 0.070, p=0.552). These findings provide strong evidence that balance is bilaterally impaired after an acute lateral ankle sprain.

In distributed settings, query semantics are well-defined, for example, queries are often designed to satisfy ACID transactional properties. When query processing is introduced in a dynamic network setting, achieving transactional semantics becomes complex due to the open and unpredictable environment. In this article, we propose a query processing model for mobile ad hoc and sensor networks that is suitable for expressing a wide range of query semantics; the semantics differ in the degree of consistency with which query results reflect the state of the environment during query execution. We introduce several distinct notions of consistency and formally express them in our model. A practical and significant contribution of this article is a protocol for query processing that automatically assesses and adaptively provides an achievable degree of consistency given the operational environment throughout its execution. The protocol attaches an assessment of the achieved guarantee to returned query results, allowing precise reasoning about a query with a range of possible semantics.

TPGF supports three features: (1) hole-bypassing, (2) the shortest path transmission, and (3) multipath transmission, at the same time. TPGF is a pure geographic greedy forwarding routing algorithm, which does not include the face routing, e.g., right/left hand rules, and does not use planarization algorithms, e.g., GG or RNG. This point allows more links to be available for TPGF to explore more routing paths, and enables TPGF to be different from many existing geographic routing algorithms.

However, there is little information regarding whether therapeutic meals designed around Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) principles have a beneficial effect on the diets of these older adults. Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the degree to which dietary change is influenced by providing 7 home-delivered therapeutic meals weekly to adults aged ≥60 y. Design: We conducted a 1-y randomized controlled trial in 298 persons with hyperlipidemia or hypertension, in which 50% of participants received 7 therapeutic meals per week for 12 mo. Those in need of dietary change at baseline (n = 210) were examined. Changes in intermediate DASH accordance, DASH accordance, and the nutrients that make up the DASH diet were measured by using 24-h food recalls at baseline, 6 mo, and 12 mo. Chi-square tests, t tests, and multiple regression were used to examine the association between receipt of meals and dietary change over time. Results: Participants who received meals were 20% (P = 0.001) more likely to reach intermediate DASH accordance at 6 mo and were 18% (P = 0.007) more likely to meet saturated fat accordance at 12 mo than were those who did not receive meals.

Design/methodology/approach: The performance assessment focused on the status of several performance indicators, both current and as recalled for 2006. The interviewer-administered questionnaire addressed access to care, provider relations with community and clients, environment, management, and primary and secondary prevention at the facilities. For each domain, a summative score that ranged from 0 to 3 was computed and a mean score for each facility derived. Findings: The project has had significant positive impact on facilities' performance. Access to care scores increased from 2.0 in 2006 to 2.5 in 2008; provider relations with community improved from 1.1 to 1.4; environment scores improved from 1.3 to 1.9, facility management improved from 1.4 to 1.7; and prevention efforts increased from 1.3 to 1.9.

Tanoak (Lithocarpus densiflorus) mortality was analyzed with respect to environmental and biotic factors using trend surface analysis and multivariate regression. Mixed-evergreen forest occurs throughout the Big Sur region but is most widespread in the north, on north facing slopes, at mid-elevations near the coast. Relative basal area of the dominant tree species changes fairly predictably from north to south and from coast to interior in relation to mapped patterns of precipitation, temperature factors and soil characteristics. Most dominant tree species sprout vigorously after fire. The forests experience a mixed-fire regime in this region ranging from low severity understory burns to high severity crown fires, with the latter increasing above the marine inversion layer and at more interior locations. Ceanothus spp. can dominate mixed-evergreen sites for several decades after severe fires. All of the dominant broadleaf evergreen tree species are hosts of P. ramorum, although not all will die from infection. Tanoak mortality decreases from northwest to southeast and is significantly correlated with climate, especially growing degree days and mean annual precipitation, and with basal area of the foliar host bay laurel (Umbellularia californica) in a 0.5-1 ha neighborhood. Adaptive management of mixed-evergreen forest to mitigate P. ramorum impacts in the region will need to consider large local and regional variation in forest composition and the potentially strong interactions between climate, fire, forest composition and disease severity.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2010.0

We also examined how these experiences differed between caregiver dyad types, such as adult children caring for parents. In-depth interviews with 15 caregivers were transcribed verbatim. Grounded theory identified themes. Constant comparative analysis compared experiences of caregiver dyads. Most caregivers recognized the likely need for future specialized care at the time of the move to the ALF, but did not recall receiving information about transfer policies. The ALF move was harder for spouses, the MCU move for adult children. Assisted living facilities can improve support for caregivers facing a relatives MCU transition through education about advantages of MCU placement and information about transfer policies.

2-s2.0-77952126255,Article,"Given the ubiquity, time investment, and theoretical relevance of meetings to work attitudes, this study explored whether organizational science should consider employee satisfaction with meetings as a contemporary, important, and discrete facet of job satisfaction. Using affective events theory, we postulated that meetings are affect-generating events that meaningfully contribute to overall job satisfaction. Two surveys queried working adults: Study 1 used a paper-based survey (n = 201), while Study 2 used an Internet-based survey (n = 785). Satisfaction with meetings was positively related to and signifi cantly predicted overall job satisfaction (p < .05) after controlling for individual difference variables (e.g., participant background variables, negative affect), traditional job satisfaction facets (e.g., work, supervision, pay), and other conceptually relevant constructs (e.g., satisfaction with communication, organizational commitment). Exploratory (Study 1) and confi rmatory (Study 2) factor analyses provided evidence that meeting satisfaction is a distinct facet of job satisfaction. Finally, as hypothesized, the relationship between meeting satisfaction and job satisfaction depends in part upon the number of meetings typically attended. The relationship was stronger (more positive) when meeting demands were higher and weaker when meeting demands were lower. Implications for assessment, leadership development, on-boarding, and high potential initiatives are discussed.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Psychology,2010.0

These heterogeneous processes have recently been conceptualized as ""hot spots and moments""of retention, degradation, or production. Nevertheless, studies investigating the importance of hot phenomena (spots and moments) in riparian zones have thus far largely focused on nitrogen (N) despite compelling evidence that a variety of elements, chemicals, and particulate contaminant cycles are subject to the influence of both biogeochemical and transport hot spots and moments. In addition to N, this review summarizes current knowledge for phosphorus, organic matter, pesticides, and mercury across riparian zones, identifies variables controlling the occurrence and magnitude of hot phenomena in riparian zones for these contaminants, and discusses the implications for riparian zone management of recognizing the importance of hot phenomena in annual solute budgets at the watershed scale. Examples are presented to show that biogeochemical process-driven hot spots and moments occur along the stream / riparian zone / upland interface for a wide variety of constituents. A basic understanding of the possible co-occurrence of hot spots and moments for a variety of contaminants in riparian systems will increase our understanding of the influence of riparian zones on water quality and guide management strategies to enhance nutrient or pollutant removal at the landscape scale.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2010.0

Because of this, it is important to understand the regulating mechanisms involved in physical activity behavior. Much research has been done in regard to the psychological determinants of physical activity behavior; however, little is known about the underlying genetic and biological factors that may contribute to regulation of this complex trait. It is true that a significant portion of any trait is regulated by genetic and biological factors. In the case of voluntary physical activity behavior, these regulating mechanisms appear to be concentrated in the central nervous system. In particular, the dopamine system has been shown to regulate motor movement, as well as motivation and reward behavior. The pattern of regulation of voluntary physical activity by the dopamine system is yet to be fully elucidated. This review will summarize what is known about the dopamine system and regulation of physical activity, and will present a hypothesis of how this signaling pathway is mechanistically involved in regulating voluntary physical activity behavior.

2-s2.0-77952192465,Article,"We varied the format and semantic content of primes to determine the degree to which they would influence the interpretation of ambiguous figures. The primes were objects or object names that were related in some way to one of the two organizations of the ambiguous figures. In Experiment 1, we provided some normative data regarding the stimulus materials, whereas in Experiment 2, an orienting question was used to focus attention on the semantic relationship between the prime and the figure. In Experiment 3, we used the orienting question to divert attention away from the relationship by asking about physical features of the figures. Recognition responses to biased versions of the figures and to new figures were measured. Primes that were loosely and indirectly associated with one of the two interpretations of an ambiguous figure were found to be effective at biasing the interpretation of an ambiguous figure in the direction of the primed alternative but only if attention was focused on the semantic relationship between the two stimuli. Attention to the physical characteristics of the stimuli during encoding eliminated the prime's influence on complex object perception. These findings are consistent with the conceptual priming literature and extend those of some recent studies (Balcetis & Dale, 2007; Feist & Gentner, 2007), which show that the interpretation of complex figures can be biased by the advanced presentation of related verbal information.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Psychology,2010.0

Although most prior research in this area has been concerned with the timing of offending onset, few studies have addressed whether the nature of initial offending shapes future criminal activity. The current study examines this issue for violence using data drawn from a sample of youthful offenders in Queensland, Australia. The key question addressed is whether offenders who onset with violence have distinct criminal career dimensions from offenders whose initial offending involves nonviolence. Specifically, the study examines whether violent onset offenders have more frequent, chronic, serious, and persistent criminal careers. Moreover, we explore whether this relationship is influenced by the timing of onset (early vs. late).

Analysis was limited to 2897 individuals working at the same facility when interviewed. Measures: Job satisfaction was measured by a 6-item score addressing workplace morale, challenging work, benefits, salary or wages, learning new skills, and overall satisfaction. Characteristics of the work environment included supervisor behavior, time pressures, organizational climate, perception that the CNA's work was valued, and whether the CNA principally cared for the same residents. Results: In adjusted analysis, organizational climate, supervisor behavior, sufficient time for tasks, and being valued were positively associated with job satisfaction, as were hourly earnings.

The coupling of shipping modes has enabled shippers to more fully realize the respective time and costs advantages of respective modes. The opportunity to take advantage of intermodalism when shipping manufactured goods overseas may provide an essential competitive edge to a company or to an entire region engaged in world commerce. The change in the freight accessibility map of the United States to foreign markets that can be ascribed to intermodal infrastructures and operations has so far not been studied. With the help of a geographic information system, this paper analyzes this transformation in the United States by mapping integral place accessibility measures of five-digit zip code areas with respect to gateways for export of manufactured goods, especially containerized freight. The performance of the intermodal freight network is evaluated by comparing accessibility measures based on the highway network and on the intermodal network, respectively, for all North American container ports, as well as for subgroups of container ports on the Eastern Seaboard, the Western Seaboard, and the Gulf Coast of North America.

However, for most alternatively spliced genes in Arabidopsis, the relative expression level of individual splicing variants is unknown.Results: We investigated prevalence of alternative splicing (AS) events in Arabidopsis thaliana using ESTs. We found that for most AS events with ample EST coverage, the majority of overlapping ESTs strongly supported one major splicing choice, with less than 10% of ESTs supporting the minor form. Analysis of ESTs also revealed a small but noteworthy subset of genes for which alternative choices appeared with about equal prevalence, suggesting that for these genes the variant splicing forms co-occur in the same cell types. Of the AS events in which both forms were about equally prevalent, more than 80% affected untranslated regions or involved small changes to the encoded protein sequence.Conclusions: Currently available evidence from ESTs indicates that alternative splicing in Arabidopsis occurs and affects many genes, but for most genes with documented alternative splicing, one AS choice predominates. To aid investigation of the role AS may play in modulating function of Arabidopsis genes, we provide an on-line resource (ArabiTag) that supports searching AS events by gene, by EST library keyword search, and by relative prevalence of minor and major forms.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2010.0

Participants used either real walking, gaze-directed, pointing-directed, or torso-directed travel to follow a target through an environment while simultaneously responding to auditory stimuli. In addition to travel technique, we investigated gender as a between-subjects variable and task difficulty (simple or complex) and task type (single or divided) as within-subjects variables. Real walking allowed superior performance over the pointing-directed technique on measures of navigation task performance and recognition of stimuli presented during navigation. This indicates that participants using real walking may have had more spare cognitive capacity to process and encode stimuli than those using pointing-directed travel. We also found a gender-difficulty interaction where males performed worse and responded slower to the attention task when the spatial task was more difficult, but no differences were observed for females between difficulty levels.

To address the problem of motivation, we have developed Astrojumper, a stereoscopic virtual reality exergame which was designed to fit the needs of children with autism. We use electromagnetic trackers and a 3-sided CAVE to present virtual space-themed stimuli to the user, who must use physical movements to avoid collisions and gain points. We can use Astrojumper not only to motivate exercise, but to evaluate the different ways people with and without autism interact with an exercise tool. Preliminary playtesting of Astrojumper has been positive, and we plan to run an extensive evaluation assessing the effectiveness of this system on children with and without autism.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2010.0

Within the context of criminology, much of this research focused on resiliency against offending; that is, understanding how and why some individuals within high-risk environments do not engage in serious criminal offenses. The extant scholarship, however, has not fully explored the effects protective factors might have on fostering resiliency against victimization. Using a sample of respondents drawn from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, this study investigated how individual protective factors and the accumulation of protective factors contribute to the explanation of resiliency against victimization. Analysis of the data revealed that commitment to school was the only statistically significant independent predictor of resiliency for at risk-individuals. Additional analyses indicated that a protective factor index measuring the accumulation of protection was significant across multiple measures of resiliency. The policy and theoretical implications of these findings are discussed.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Criminal Justice and Criminology,2010.0
2-s2.0-77953164119,Article,"Young basalt terrains offer an exceptional opportunity to study landscape and hydrologic evolution through time, since the age of the landscape itself can be determined by dating lava flows. These constructional terrains are also highly permeable, allowing one to examine timescales and process of geomorphic evolution as they relate to the partitioning of hydrologic flowpaths between surface and sub-surface flow. The western slopes of the Cascade Range in Oregon, USA are composed of a thick sequence of lava flows ranging from Holocene to Oligocene in age, and the landscape receives abundant precipitation of between 2000 and 3500 mm per year. On Holocene and late Pleistocene lava landscapes, groundwater systems transmit most of the recharge to large springs (≥0·85 m3 s-1) with very steady hydrographs. In watersheds &gt;1 million years old, springs are absent, and well-developed drainage networks fed by shallow subsurface stormflow produce flashy hydrographs. Drainage density slowly increases with time in this basalt landscape, requiring a million years to double in density. Progressive hillslope steepening and fluvial incision also occur on this timescale. Springs and groundwater-fed streams transport little sediment and hence are largely ineffective in incising river valleys, so fluvial landscape dissection appears to occur only after springs are replaced by shallow subsurface stormflow as the dominant streamflow generation mechanism. It is proposed that landscape evolution in basalt terrains is constrained by the time required for permeability to be reduced sufficiently for surface flow to replace groundwater flow.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2010.0

The identifi cation of variables associated with alcohol use may inform early intervention efforts to decrease negative consequences. This longitudinal prospective study examined the associations of demographic and stress variables with alcohol use among 876 soldiers that were mobilized and demobilized through an Army installation during a 9-month period in 2003. Participants reported a moderate level of general stress at mobilization and demobilization, and a minority reported signifi cant combat stress. Alcohol use in the 2 weeks before the demobilization evaluation was associated with younger age, nonactive duty status before mobilization, and more general stress.

The results suggest that younger, nonactive duty male personnel experiencing stress may be a group at risk for increased drinking after deployment and for whom intervention may be helpful.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Psychology,2010.0
2-s2.0-77953274899,Article,"Despite their importance, there has been surprisingly little scholarly examination of the NAGC Pre-K --Grade 12 Gifted Program Standards (NAGC, 2008/2000; Landrum, Callahan, & Shaklee, 2001) since their publication a decade ago. As part of a larger study investigating the effectiveness of local policies developed within the framework of state law, we used a qualitative approach to examine the 'minimum' and 'exemplary' criteria from the Student Identification portion of these NAGC Standards. Through this process we developed a 27-item checklist, which we then used to evaluate 43 locally developed plans for identifying diverse gifted learners from one large state in the southeastern United States. Based on this experience, we identify the strengths and weaknesses that we encountered in using the Standards for this purpose. We provide the checklist items we developed, and we offer specific suggestions for how the Gifted Program Standards in their currently ongoing revision process might be made more user-friendly for practitioners to apply toward effective evaluation of gifted program documents. Putting the Research to Use Our experience in using the Student Identification portion of the NAGC Pre-K --Grade 12 Gifted Program Standards highlights some difficulties in using a national standards document directly to evaluate district-level program descriptions and policies. Specifically, we found three aspects that hindered the application of the Student Identification framework to the evaluation of local policies: 1) A standard identified as Exemplary could be met in some cases without first satisfying the Minimum requirement of the same numbered standard; 2) Some standards included more than one criterion within a single numbered standard, and district documents satisfied one but not all of these criteria; and 3) The lack of consensus on terminology led to the use of some words such as screening to mean different things in the NAGC Standards than in the district documents, while other terms were too broad (such as culturally fair) or too narrow to prove useful in evaluating plan quality. The responsibility for developing and implementing policies and procedures often rests at the local level. Consequently, we believe that practitioners will find a checklist such as the one we have developed and presented here to be a useful bridge between the language and aims of standards documents and the tangible goals of those who develop and implement policies within the framework of state rules. We suggest that the currently ongoing revisions to these NAGC Standards should consider our findings in the three areas described above, and we recommend continued support for the development of ancillary materials as has been provided for these and other national standards documents.",Education,Special Education and Child Development,2010.0

In this paper, we aim to understand the theoretical limitations of data collection in terms of possible and achievable maximum capacity. Previously, the study of data collection capacity [1]-[6] has only concentrated on large-scale random networks. However, in most of practical sensor applications, the sensor network is not deployed uniformly and the number of sensors may not be as huge as in theory. Therefore, it is necessary to study the capacity of data collection in an arbitrary network. In this paper, we derive the upper and constructive lower bounds for data collection capacity in arbitrary networks. The proposed data collection method can lead to order-optimal performance for any arbitrary sensor networks.

The question of interest was whether these stimuli would also reduce format effects for older adults whose working memory capacity has fewer attentional resources to allocate. Results showed that older adults performed as well as younger adults with three items but less well with six and that format effects were reduced for both age groups, but more for young, when alternating case words were used.

Unfortunately, time theft, a common and costly form of ethical misconduct at work, has been understudied by ethics researchers. In order to remedy this gap in the literature, we used the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to investigate the antecedents of time theft, which includes behaviors such as arriving later to or leaving earlier from work than scheduled, taking additional or longer breaks than is acceptable, and on-the-job daydreaming. We surveyed 135 employed undergraduate business students regarding the TPB variables at Time 1. Two months later, participants reported the frequency they engaged in time theft since Time 1. Results indicate that behavioral, normative, and control beliefs significantly predicted attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control, respectively. Attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control, in turn, were significantly related to time theft intentions, which predicted later enactment of time theft. Thus, employers can decrease time theft by primarily focusing on altering employees' attitudes toward time theft, followed by reducing social pressures to engage in it, and lastly, by implementing organizational practices that make it difficult to commit time theft.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Psychology,2010.0

Understanding the differences between these groups may provide insight into the mechanisms of CAI. The objectives of this investigation were to: (1) compare traditional center of pressure [COP], time-to-boundary [TTB], and center of pressure-center of mass [COP-COM] moment arm measures of postural control among controls, established copers, and subjects with CAI and (2) determine the accuracy of these postural control measures at discriminating between established copers and subjects with CAI using receiving operating characteristic curves. 48 subjects (control=16, coper=16, CAI=16) completed two, 30-s trials of single-leg stance on a force plate with their eyes open. Coper and CAI subjects stood on their involved limb while controls stood on a matched limb. The results indicated that mediolateral (p<0.01) and anteroposterior (p<0.01) COP velocity was greater in individuals with CAI relative to both copers and controls. Similarly, the peak COP-COM moment arm in the anteroposterior direction (p<0.01) and the resultant mean COP-COM moment arm (p<0.01) were increased in individuals with CAI relative to copers. These measures also reached asymptotic significance (p<0.05) indicating that they successfully discriminated between established copers and individuals with CAI.",CHHS,Kinesiology,2010.0
2-s2.0-77953539006,Article,"Policymakers often question whether not-for-profit (NFP) hospitals provide enough charity care to justify tax advantages. In 1993, Texas enacted legislation requiring NFP hospitals to provide certain community benefits at levels set forth in specific criteria to retain tax-exempt status; this paper focuses on the effect of the legislation's requirement that NFP hospitals spend a minimum of 4% of net patient revenue on charity care. We also study a modification of the law passed in 1995, which allows the deduction of bad debts expense when calculating net patient revenue. This change effectively lowers required charity care spending, and our study considers whether Texas hospitals responded by reducing charity care spending.We test the Texas laws' effect on hospital charity care spending using financial data for 1992 through 1997. As anticipated, results show that, on average, NFP hospitals spending below the 4% threshold increased their charity care spending to meet this threshold. Surprisingly, NFP hospitals spending above the threshold experienced a marginally significant decrease in spending. After the 1995 law change, hospitals with higher total margins decreased charity care spending, an unintended consequence of the legislation.Overall, the Texas law changes did not, on average, lead to increased charity care spending by NFP hospitals. While spending increased by NFPs providing too little charity care prior to the law, this group represents less than 20% of our sample. These findings are particularly important given the increase in Texas uninsurance rates during the sample period. Seventeen states have followed Texas' lead by enacting legislation regarding the charity care spending by NFPs, thus an empirical investigation into the impact of this precedent-setting legislation is critical for evaluating the effectiveness of specific charity care requirements.",Business,Economics,2010.0

The parents' self-reported PTG was a significant predictor of PTG in their children, suggesting that social processes play a role in the development of PTG in youth. Parental self-reported posttraumatic stress symptoms did not predict PTG in their children nor did youth's ratings of family cohesion, but parental tsunami-related sick leave related to lower levels of PTG reported by their children. Overall, these findings imply that elements of parents' functioning can affect children's positive adaptation after a disaster and highlight the need to assess potential parental influences and those of other sources of support in the child's environment after trauma.

The motives and firm factors differ by the type of issue (ADR versus foreign IPO) and by the market in which the foreign exchange is located (Hong Kong versus Singapore). Subsequent to the listing events, issuers experience a significant drop in profitability, tangible assets ratio, and asset turnover. There is no significant change in capital expenditure.

We consider a firm which can sell an experience good in physical form, in digitized form, or both. We analyze different pricing schemes - price for whole album on the retail channel and linear and nonlinear pricing for songs on the digital channel. Consumers are divided into a retail-captive segment whose consumers are limited to the retail channel and a hybrid segment whose consumers have access to both retail and digital channels. Our findings indicate that for realistic problems, the dual distribution channel is most profitable. The profitability of the retail channel increases with the size of the retail-captive segment and the number of desirable songs on an album relative to the total number of songs on it. We show that a skimming pricing strategy is best for the retail channel. The ability to sell the product in digitized form on the Internet erodes much of the power once enjoyed by the record labels. The digital channel may be the best way to promote new artists, especially when the hybrid consumer segment is large. We also find that piracy has a significant effect on channel profits for both the retail and digital channels. Piracy has the strongest negative impact on the exclusive retail channel. Consumers' access to the digital channel reduces piracy in both digital and dual-channel distribution.

Interventions: Subjects performed a 1-legged drop landing from a standardized height under 3 different ankle-support conditions. Main Outcome Measures: Hip, knee, and ankle angular displacement along with specific temporal (TGRFz1, TGRFz2; s) and spatial (GRFz1, GRFz2; body-weight units [BW]) characteristics of the VGRF vector were measured during a drop landing. Results: The tape condition (1.08 ± 0.09 BW) demonstrated less GRFz1 than the control (1.28 ± 0.16 BW) and semirigid conditions (1.28 ± 0.21 BW; P &lt; .0001), and GRFz2 was unaffected. For TGRFz1, no-support displayed slower time (0.017 ± 0.004 s) than the semirigid (0.014 ± 0.001 s) and tape conditions (0.014 ± 0.002 s; P &lt; .05).

Carbon storage rates depend on ecosystem fluxes (photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration), typically quantified as net ecosystem exchange (NEE). Methods to estimate forest NEE without intensive site sampling are needed to accurately assess rates of carbon sequestration at stand-level and larger scales. We produced spatially-explicit estimates of NEE for 9 770 ha of slash pine (Pinus elliottii) plantations in North-Central Florida for a single year by coupling remote sensing-based estimates of leaf area index (LAI) with a process-based growth simulation model. LAI estimates produced from a neural-network modeling of ground plot and Landsat TM satellite data had a mean of 1.06 (range 0-3.93, including forest edges).

Mobile device limitations, such as small user interface footprint and pen input whilst in motion, result in information overload on such devices and interfaces which are difficult to navigate and interact with. This has become a major issue as mobile GIS applications are now being used by a wide group of users, including novice users such as tourists, for whom it is essential to provide easy-to-use applications. Despite this, comparatively little research has been conducted to address the mobility problem. We are particularly concerned with the limited interaction techniques available to users of mobile GIS which play a primary role in contributing to the complexity of using such an application whilst mobile. As such, our research focuses on multimodal interfaces as a means to present users with a wider choice of modalities for interacting with mobile GIS applications.

Faith-Based Advocacy Organizations (FBAOs) are religious organizations that work through legislative bodies to create social change. Representing a variety of theological and political perspectives, these groups are active in Washington, DC and in a number of state legislatures throughout the country. Such religious institutions, however, are rarely considered in academic literature.

2-s2.0-77954181455,Article,"Traditionally, observers have characterized leadership political action committees (LPACs) as tools used by political entrepreneurs to build personal coalitions supporting their power and policy goals. We argue that political context - namely, competition for control of the House and the advancement structures created by the parties - shapes the way House members use LPAC contributions to advance their careers. As congressional parties have become more oriented towards attaining majority status since the GOP takeover in 1995, LPAC contributions should have shifted towards helping the party win majority status rather than building individual coalitions. We use rare events logit to estimate the probability of incumbent to candidate contributions in the 1990, 1998 and 2004 election cycles. Our evidence shows that Democratic, but not Republican, LPAC contributions have generally become more party-centred as party margins have tightened.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Political Science and Public Administration,2010.0
2-s2.0-77954289006,Article,"In building intelligent tutoring systems, it is critical to be able to understand and diagnose student responses in interactive problem solving. However, building this understanding into a computer-based intelligent tutor is a time-intensive process usually conducted by subject experts. Much of this time is spent in building production rules that model all the ways a student might solve a problem. In our prior work, we proposed a novel application of Markov decision processes (MDPs) to automatically generate hints for an intelligent tutor that learns. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by extracting MDPs from four semesters of student solutions in a logic proof tutor, and calculating the probability that we will be able to generate hints for students at any point in a given problem. Our past results indicated that extracted MDPs and our proposed hint-generating functions will be able to provide hints over 80% of the time. Our results also indicated that we can provide valuable tradeoffs between hint specificity and the amount of data used to create an MDP.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2010.0

The Wolves occupied home ranges during 1118 month observation periods, and the GPS data were divided into 30-day subsets to evaluate changes in the spatial characteristics of the home ranges over time. The subset location data were then combined with land-cover maps derived from Landsat satellite imagery. Proportions of different land-cover types occupied by the Wolves were seasonally cyclic, with increased use of agricultural areas when tall row crops were available from summer to autumn and increased use of adj acent grass, brush, and forest areas from winter to late spring when tall crops were absent. The spatial extents of home ranges (95% fixed-kernel probability areas) were also seasonally variable, reaching maximum sizes (73121 km2) in early autumn to winter and contracting by 40% to 63% during whelping and pup-rearing in the spring. Our study shows the potential for GPS collars to provide useful information about space and habitat use by Red Wolves, and that at least a full year of observation may be required to fully determine the variability of home-range characteristics.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2010.0

From 1997 to 2004 NASCAR saw a 24.6% increase in their fan base while other professional sports organisations declined. Identification and perceived intimacy with NASCAR drivers may partially explain heightened fan commitment; but, is there also a role for the fan community? This paper examines how fan communities and their folklore strengthen fan commitment to NASCAR and its drivers. Using qualitative analyses of folklore surrounding NASCAR drivers we identify and discuss the lore of identity and of shared and clashing values. Findings suggest that empathy with a driver, expressed in stories fans tell from their experiences and observations, enhances their commitment and contributes to the folklore of the larger fan community. Fans differentiate between drivers based on shared and clashing values, creating stories of conflict, heightening the drama of NASCAR and building fan commitment to drivers with shared values.",Business,Marketing,2010.0

2-s2.0-77954438715,Article,"Participants in international bargaining include different types (nation states, MNEs, NGOs, and multilateral organizations) and different numbers of these actors. Our theoretical contribution is to extend the bargaining power paradigm with a framework that models bargaining in this complex environment as a network. The configuration of supports and constraints among all participating actors in the bargaining environment is captured in the structure of the network. Antecedents of an actor's bargaining influence in the network include the actor's basis of power, network position, bargaining outcome preferences, and motivation to influence bargaining. The network bargaining power (NBP) model uses network theory to build upon and integrate insights from previous literature in a way that allows us to simultaneously apply these different insights to explain bargaining outcomes. These insights include effects of coalitions, strategies of less powerful actors leveraging more powerful allies, integration of international and domestic politics, and applicability to MNE-related issues beyond FDI. Finally, we illustrate NBP in a scenario of privatized utilities in the Dominican Republic, in which the bargaining power outcome predicted by NBP differs from that of the canonical bargaining power perspective.",Business,Management,2010.0

However, state and local sales tax bases have been eroding steadily during the past 50 years. Base erosion contributes to fiscal stress in the states; therefore, prospects for continued sales tax base erosion are important to state tax administrators, policymakers and public finance economists. This article offers a quantitative assessment of base erosion. We construct time series of a representative state sales tax base and its price index, and estimate a structural demand system for 'taxed' and 'untaxed' commodities. We use the estimates to forecast the sales tax base over coming years. Time-series forecasts and a weighted-average forecast are constructed, to reduce the likelihood of forecast error. The results suggest slow, but relentless, base erosion and possible recurring fiscal stress, in states where sales tax revenues make up sizable fractions of total tax revenues.",Business,Economics,2010.0

Particulate organic matter (POM), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved oxygen (DO), electrical conductivity and temperature were sampled from wells in a riparian terrace on the Queets River, Washington, U.S.A. on 25 March, 15 May, 20 July and 09 October 1999. Dissolved nitrate, ammonium and soluble reactive phosphorus were also collected on 20 July and 09 October 1999. Wells were characterised by their associated overlying vegetation: bare cobble/young alder, mid-aged alder (8-20 years) and old alder/old-growth conifer (25 to &gt;100 years). POM was analysed for the ash-free dry mass and the activities of eight exoenzymes (α-glucosidase, β-glucosidase, β -N-acetylglucosaminidase, xylosidase, phosphatase, leucine aminopeptidase, esterase and endopeptidase) using fluorogenic substrates. Exoenzyme activities in the Queets River hyporheic zone indicated the presence of an active microbial community metabolising a diverse array of organic molecules. Individual exoenzyme activity (mean ± standard error) ranged from 0.507 ± 0.1547 to 22.8 ± 5.69 μmol MUF (g AFDM)-1 h-1, was highly variable among wells and varied seasonally, with the lowest rates occurring in March. Exoenzyme activities were weakly correlated with DO, DOC and inorganic nutrient concentrations. Ratios of leucine aminopeptidase: β-glucosidase were low in March, May and October and high in July, potentially indicating a switch from polysaccharides to proteins as the dominant component of microbial metabolism. Principal components analysis indicated that there were patch effects and that these effects were strongest in the summer. DOM degradation patterns did not change systematically along hyporheic flowpaths but varied with overlying forest patch type in the Queets River hyporheic zone, suggesting that additional carbon inputs exist. We hypothesise that the most likely input is the downward movement of DOM from overlying riparian soils. Understanding this movement of DOM from soils to subsurface water is essential for understanding both the hyporheic metabolism and the carbon budget of streams and rivers.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2010.0

Among the BES it was possible to identify 623 contig-linked SSRs, most of which were highly AT-rich. A subgroup of 230 di-nucleotide and tri-nucleotide based SSR primer pairs from these BACs was tested on the mapping parents with 176 single copy loci and 114 found to be polymorphic markers. Of these, 99 were successfully integrated into the genetic map. The 99 linkages between the genetic and physical maps corresponded to an equal number of contigs containing a total of 5,055 BAC clones.Conclusions: Class II microsatellites were more common in the BES than longer class I microsatellites. Both types of markers proved to be valuable for linking BAC clones to the genetic map and were successfully placed across all 11 linkage groups.

However, privacy concerns often prevent multiple competitive organizations from sharing and integrating their patient training videos. In addition, patients with infectious or chronic diseases may not want the online patient training organizations to identify who they are or even which video clips they are interested in. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop more effective techniques to protect both video content privacy and access privacy. In this paper, we have developed a new approach to construct a distributed Hippocratic video database system for supporting more profitable online patient training and counseling. First, a new database modeling approach is developed to support concept-oriented video database organization and assign a degree of privacy of the video content for each database level automatically. Second, a new algorithm is developed to protect the video content privacy at the level of individual video clip by filtering out the privacy-sensitive human objects automatically. In order to integrate the patient training videos from multiple competitive organizations for constructing a centralized video database indexing structure, a privacy-preserving video sharing scheme is developed to support privacy-preserving distributed classifier training and prevent the statistical inferences from the videos that are shared for cross-validation of video classifiers. Our experiments on large-scale video databases have also provided very convincing results.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2010.0

Method.In the first part of this study, the cognitive functioning of nursing home residents with MS (n=1890) and without MS (n=22,985) were compared. In the second part, demographic and other variables were used to predict cognition at the admission and 1-year annual assessment for MS residents. Results.Nursing home residents with MS had better cognitive functioning than residents without MS at admission and 1 year later. Regression analyses demonstrated that higher education and pain predicted higher Minimum Data Set Cognition Scale (MDS-Cog) at admission and at 1 year later, but poorer activities of daily living predicted worse MDS-Cog at admission and 1 year later. For the longitudinal analysis, MDS-Cog at the admission assessment was an independent predictor of MDS-Cog scores at the 1-year annual assessment.

Using a fuzzy query, an application programmer can provide a linguistic and semantic specification of the desired data, eliminating the need to specify explicit and exact thresholds as part of a query. The returned fuzzy query results are each associated with a degree of membership measurement that indicates how closely each returned data value matches the semantic intent of the fuzzy query, providing applications with additional information that can be used to reason about the query result. Our approach to in-network fuzzy query processing allows for each sensor node to tailor its evaluation of a fuzzy query; this feature allows for consideration of micro-environments embedded within the sensor network that can impact how individual sensor data values should be interpreted with respect to the semantic intent of the query. To demonstrate that a fuzzy query processing approach is feasible, we use an application scenario to evaluate the implementation of our fuzzy query processing system in a simulated sensor network environment; results show that precision and overhead for our approach are comparable to traditional query processing.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2010.0

2-s2.0-77954762786,Article,"Criminal decision making is an inherently natural and highly individualized process; however, rather than allowing participants to self-identify the costs and benefits that impact their own decisions to offend, rational choice researchers have typically provided participants with a uniform list of consequences to consider. Indirect evidence suggests this technique may alter the participants' perceptions of consequences, yet no study to date has examined this supposition directly. In the current study, participants were randomly assigned to experimental conditions in which they either received a list of traditional costs and benefits to assess or were asked to self-generate their own list to assess. As in past research, when participants were allowed to self-generated consequences they identified several ""novel"" costs/benefits that have certainty/severity rating comparable to many of the traditionally examined consequences. Results also showed that consequences are more likely to be perceived as possible outcomes (i.e., receive a non-zero probability) when they are presented by researchers than when they are self-generated. Finally, the average certainty and severity of negative consequences do not differ across condition, while ratings of the certainty and value of benefits from crime are relatively lower when they are presented by researchers.

2-s2.0-77954782940,Article,"Background: Our current understanding of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) in sequenced prokaryotic genomes is very limited due to the lack of an accurate and efficient computational method for the prediction of TFBSs at a genome scale. In an attempt to change this situation, we have recently developed a comparative genomics based algorithm called GLECLUBS for de novo genome-wide prediction of TFBSs in a target genome. Although GLECLUBS has achieved rather high prediction accuracy of TFBSs in a target genome, it is still not efficient enough to be applied to all the sequenced prokaryotic genomes.Results: Here, we designed a new algorithm based on GLECLUBS called extended GLECLUBS (eGLECLUBS) for simultaneous prediction of TFBSs in a group of related prokaryotic genomes. When tested on a group of γ-proteobacterial genomes including E. coli K12, a group of firmicutes genomes including B. subtilis and a group of cyanobacterial genomes using the same parameter settings, eGLECLUBS predicts more than 82% of known TFBSs in extracted inter-operonic sequences in both E. coli K12 and B. subtilis. Because each genome in a group is equally treated, it is highly likely that similar prediction accuracy has been achieved for each genome in the group.Conclusions: We have developed a new algorithm for genome-wide de novo prediction of TFBSs in a group of related prokaryotic genomes.

A disruption occurring within a supply chain, whether it is attributable to a natural disaster or a human-induced event, presents substantial risk to organizations within the supply chain and the markets that it serves. In this paper, we discuss new research toward a risk-based modeling approach to managing a GSC disruption. We introduce the concept of a supply-risk network to capture potential disruptions. Using this framework, we formulate a GSC disruption-risk model that allows for organizations within the supply chain to strategically plan for the sourcing (i.e., procurement) and flow of goods throughout the supply chain in a manner that directly incorporates the risk of disruption. The GSC disruption-risk model is formulated as a two-stage stochastic integer programming problem with fixed recourse, which is an appropriate modeling approach when decisions can be made after uncertainties are resolved in order to ensure that the stochastic constraints hold. This formulation is illustrated with an example five-node network. Furthermore, we explore implications of increasing the reliability of nodes in the network. Finally, we conclude with implications for further theoretical research and for managerial practice.",Business,Management,2010.0
2-s2.0-77955103653,Article,"Background. Protein sequence insertions/deletions (indels) can be introduced during evolution or through alternative splicing (AS). Alternative splicing is an important biological phenomenon and is considered as the major means of expanding structural and functional diversity in eukaryotes. Knowledge of the structural changes due to indels is critical to our understanding of the evolution of protein structure and function. In addition, it can help us probe the evolution of alternative splicing and the diversity of functional isoforms. However, little is known about the effects of indels, in particular the ones involving core secondary structures, on the folding of protein structures. The long term goal of our study is to accurately predict the protein AS isoform structures. As a first step towards this goal, we performed a systematic analysis on the structural changes caused by short internal indels through mining highly homologous proteins in Protein Data Bank (PDB). Results. We compiled a non-redundant dataset of short internal indels (2-40 amino acids) from highly homologous protein pairs and analyzed the sequence and structural features of the indels. We found that about one third of indel residues are in disordered state and majority of the residues are exposed to solvent, suggesting that these indels are generally located on the surface of proteins. Though naturally occurring indels are fewer than engineered ones in the dataset, there are no statistically significant differences in terms of amino acid frequencies and secondary structure types between the ""Natural"" indels and ""All"" indels in the dataset. Structural comparisons show that all the protein pairs with short internal indels in the dataset preserve the structural folds and about 85% of protein pairs have global RMSDs (root mean square deviations) of 2 or less, suggesting that protein structures tend to be conserved and can tolerate short insertions and deletions. A few pairs with high RMSDs are results of relative domain positions of the proteins, probably due to the intrinsically dynamic nature of the proteins. Conclusions. The analysis demonstrated that protein structures have the ""plasticity"" to tolerate short indels. This study can provide valuable guides in modeling protein AS isoform structures and homologous proteins with indels through placing the indels at the right locations since the accuracy of sequence alignments dictate model qualities in homology modeling.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2010.0

2-s2.0-77955144293,Conference Paper,"Many current team-based first-person-shooters(FPS) have limited communication between players. Voice chat and text are the two primary methods of communicating however, in fast paced games, this is insufficient for making sophisticated plans. Giving players more non-verbal forms of communication could reduce the time necessary to develop plans which will likely increase the number of strategic plans used in first-person-shooters. By using information visualization techniques in games, we can provide players a faster method to communicate with their teammates, allowing teams to develop more complex plans quickly. We present ways in which player communication can be improved, reducing the necessary time to make effective strategic plans and increasing the amount of cooperative play amongst teammates. Using Source, a 3D game engine developed by Valve Corporation, we plan on developing a 'mod' to incorporate changes to further enable cooperative play.

Analyses focused on child self-system functioning and cognitive processes, and the caregiving context, in predicting PTG at 2 time points (Time 1 n = 66, Time 2 n = 51). Findings suggest that rumination, both negative, distressing thoughts and constructive, repetitive thinking, plays an important role in PTG. Hypotheses regarding future expectations and perceived competence were not fully supported, and, unexpectedly, coping competency beliefs, realistic control attributions, and perceived caregiver warmth did not contribute to PTG models. With 1 exception (positive reframing coping advice), caregiver-reported variables did not relate to PTG; no caregiver variable reached significance in final models.

To better suit these preferences, and to improve CS educational techniques, teaching methods and tools outside of the traditional lecture sessions and textbooks must be explored and implemented. Currently, both serious games and collaborative classroom work, including pair programming, are the focus of studies meant to do just this. The proposed work deals with both serious games and student collaboration research, positing that educational games with collaborative elements (multiplayer games) will take advantage of the benefits offered by each of these areas, resulting in an educational game that demonstrates increased learning gains and student engagement above that of individual learning game experiences. Collaborative educational games and software also have the potential to solve many of the problems that collaborative work may pose to course instructors in terms of helping to regulate and evaluate student performance.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2010.0
2-s2.0-77955166021,Article,"In this article, we address the problem of allocating an additional cell tower (or a set of towers) to an existing cellular network, maximizing the call completion probability. Our approach is derived from the adaptive spatial sampling problem using kriging, capitalizing on spatial correlation between cell phone signal strength data points and accounting for terrain morphology. Cell phone demand is reflected by population counts in the form of weights. The objective function, which is the weighted call completion probability, is highly nonlinear and complex (nondifferentiable and discontinuous). Sequential and simultaneous discrete optimization techniques are presented, and heuristics such as simulated annealing and Nelder-Mead are suggested to solve our problem. The adaptive spatial sampling problem is defined and related to the additional facility location problem. The approach is illustrated using data on cell phone call completion probability in a rural region of Erie County in western New York, and accounts for terrain variation using a line-of-sight approach. Finally, the computational results of sequential and simultaneous approaches are compared. Our model is also applicable to other facility location problems that aim to minimize the uncertainty associated with a customer visiting a new facility that has been added to an existing set of facilities.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2010.0

This study was based on a population of convenience stores (n = 295) and fast-food restaurants (n = 321) in Charlotte, North Carolina. The study examined whether the crime control strategies commonly recommended to the convenience store industry were effective at reducing robbery in the fast-food industry. Relatedly, the study examined whether target-hardening strategies have similar effects on robbery prevalence rates across the two types of businesses. In general, the article found that many target-hardening strategies derived from the literature failed to impact robbery rates for either type of establishment. For those factors that did emerge as statistically significant predictors of robbery, the preventative effects generally appeared in one type of establishment or the other, but not in both.

We conceptualize this frequently observed, but largely ignored phenomenon as technology overload, when additional technology tools begin to crowd out one's productivity instead of enhancing it. We found support for three main factors contributing technology-based productivity losses through information overload, communication overload, and system feature overload. Interestingly, these factors are a function of the individuals who use the technology, not the technology itself. In this paper, we present the results from three studies that (1) develop and pre-test a scale measurement for technology overload and its distinct dimensions, (2) validate the instrument, and (3) explore the relationship between technology overload and knowledge worker productivity. Our findings demonstrate the relationship between information technology usage and knowledge worker productivity, and they suggest how tradeoffs can be managed to ameliorate technology overload.",Business,BISOM,2010.0

This research was the first attempt to understand the attitudes, beliefs and practices of managers of public and private enterprises regarding smoke-free worksite policies. &Methods: Mixed methods were used. The study team conducted focus group discussions with worksite administrators to explore their beliefs, attitudes and practices related to worksite smoking. These findings guided development of a quantitative instrument to collect more representative data on the same issues. Using stratified random sampling, 243 worksites were interviewed from June-July 2005, representing state/ municipal, health, educational, culture and business institutions in three of Armenia's largest cities. &Results/Discussion: Smoking-related practices differed significantly across institutions. More than half of the managers (55.6%) reported having smoking restrictions at worksites, including 37.0% who reported smoke-free workplaces; however, smoking or the presence of ashtrays was observed in 27.8% of workplaces reported to be smoke-free. A substantial proportion of the administrators favored both banning indoor smoking and allowing smoking in special areas. Only 38.0% of managers were aware of employees' existing legal protections from exposure to secondhand smoke. Knowledge of these regulations was not related to adherence to smoke-free worksite policies. The research also revealed widespread confusion between the concepts of worksite smoking restrictions and smoke- free workplaces. Public awareness campaigns that promote promulgation and enforcement of worksite smoking regulations could increase employee demand for smoke-free worksites. &Conclusion: As one of the first studies to investigate smoking-related worksite practices, attitudes and beliefs in former Soviet countries, these findings provide insight into law enforcement processes in economies in transition.",CHHS,Public Health,2010.0

Common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) change dietary requirements for choline intake. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine whether total choline intake and/or SNPs influence concentrations of choline and its metabolites in human breast milk and plasma. Design: We gave a total of 103 pregnant women supplemental choline or a placebo from 18 wk gestation to 45 d postpartum and genotyped the women for 370 common SNPs. At 45 d postpartum, we measured choline metabolite concentrations in breast milk and plasma and assessed the dietary intake of choline by using a 3-d food record. Results: On average, lactating women in our study ate two-thirds of the recommended intake for choline (Adequate Intake = 550 mg choline/d). Dietary choline intake (no supplement) correlated with breast-milk phosphatidylcholine and plasma choline concentrations. A supplement further increased breast-milk choline, betaine, and phosphocholine concentrations and increased plasma choline and betaine concentrations. We identified 5 SNPs in MTHFR that altered the slope of the intake-metabolite concentration relations, and we identified 2 SNPs in PEMT that shifted these curves upward. Individuals who shared sets of common SNPs were outliers in plots of intake-metabolite concentration curves; we suggest that these SNPs should be further investigated to determine how they alter choline metabolism. Conclusion: Total intake of choline and genotype can influence the concentrations of choline and its metabolites in the breast milk and blood of lactating women and thereby affect the amount of choline available to the developing infant.

2-s2.0-77955509717,Article,"An isolated outbreak of the emerging forest disease sudden oak death was discovered in Oregon forests in 2001. Despite considerable control efforts, disease continues to spread from the introduction site due to slow and incomplete detection and eradication. Annual field surveys and laboratory tests between 2001 and 2009 confirmed a total of 802 infested locations. Here, we apply two invasive species distribution models (iSDMs) of sudden oak death establishment and spread risk to target early detection and control further disease spread in Oregon forests. The goal was to develop (1) a model of potential distribution that estimates the level and spatial variability of disease establishment and spread risk for western Oregon, and (2) a model of actual distribution that quantifies the relative likelihood of current invasion in the quarantine area. Our predictions were based on four groups of primary parameters that vary in space and time: climate conditions, topographical factors, abundance and susceptibility of host vegetation, and dispersal pressure. First, we used multi-criteria evaluation to identify large-scale areas at potential risk of infection. We mapped and ranked host abundance and susceptibility using geospatial vegetation data developed with gradient nearest neighbor imputation. The host vegetation and climate variables were parameterized in accordance to their epidemiological importance and the final appraisal scores were summarized by month to represent a cumulative spread risk index, standardized as five categories from very low to very high risk. Second, using the field data for calibration we applied the machine-learning method, maximum entropy, to predict the actual distribution of the sudden oak death epidemic. The dispersal pressure incorporated in the statistical model estimates the force of invasion at all susceptible locations, allowing us to quantify the relative likelihood of current disease incidence rather than its potential distribution. Our predictions show that 65km2 of forested land was invaded by 2009, but further disease spread threatens more than 2100km2 of forests across the western region of Oregon (very high and high risk). Areas at greatest risk of disease spread are concentrated in the southwest region of Oregon where the highest densities of susceptible host species exist. This research identifies high priority locations for early detection and invasion control and illustrates how iSDMs can be used to analyze the actual versus potential distribution of emerging infectious disease in a complex, heterogeneous ecosystem.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2010.0
2-s2.0-77955513067,Article,"Although connectivity has been examined from many different angles and in many ecological disciplines, few studies have tested in which systems and under what conditions connectivity is important in determining ecological dynamics. Identifying general rules governing when connectivity is important is crucial not only for basic ecology, but also for our ability to manage natural systems, particularly as increasing fragmentation may change the degree to which connectivity influences ecological dynamics. In this study, we used statistical regression, least-cost path analysis, and model selection techniques to test the relative importance of potential connectivity in determining the spatial pattern of sudden oak death, a tree disease that is killing millions of oak and tanoak trees along coastal forests of California and Oregon. We hypothesized that potential connectivity, in addition to environmental conditions, is important in determining the spatial distribution of sudden oak death, the importance of connectivity is more apparent when measured using biologically meaningful metrics that account for the effects of landscape structure on disease spread, and the relative importance of environmental variables and connectivity is approximately equal. Results demonstrate that potential connectivity was important in determining the spatial pattern of sudden oak death, though it was relatively less important than environmental variables. Moreover, connectivity was important only when using biologically meaningful metrics as opposed to simple distance-based metrics that ignore landscape structure. These results demonstrate that connectivity can be important in systems not typically considered in connectivity studies - highlighting the importance of examining connectivity in a variety of different systems - and demonstrate that the manner in which connectivity is measured may govern our ability to detect its importance.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2010.0

Patients and Methods. This retrospective cohort analysis included 93,604 health plan members aged 656 years with ≥2 years of continuous enrollment (20032007), an asthma diagnosis, and asthma prescription claims. The amount of SABA dispensed in claims (metered-dose inhaler and nebulized) was converted to canister equivalents (CEs) in the first observation quarter and categorized as 0, 0.53, and ≥3 (excessive SABA use). Asthma exacerbation risk (hospitalization, emergency department ED visit, or oral corticosteroid OCS claim in the subsequent quarter) was assessed using logistic regression. Covariates used in the regression models were age, sex, geographic region, comorbidities, specialist consultation, asthma controller medication use, and asthma severity. Results. The cohort included 33,951 patients aged 6-17 years (36%) and 59,653 aged 1856 years (64%); 64% had 0 SABA CE, and 5% had &gt;3 SABA CEs.

Herein, we hypothesize that reduction in leukocyte adhesion and, hence, leukocyte-endothelial interaction by activated protein C (aPC) may preserve hepatic function after sepsis. Methods:: Rats underwent sham or cecal ligation and puncture, followed by saline or aPC (1 mg/kg intravenously) infusion, twice daily for 4 days. Cytokine levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Liver function and injury were assessed by bile production and plasma aspartate transaminase, respectively. In parallel experiments, neutrophils were labeled with Rhodamine 6G, and trafficking determined by cell motion tracking using intravital microscopy. Leukocyte trafficking and traveling velocity were computed at baseline and at 10 minutes and 40 minutes after endothelin-1 infusion. Results:: Sepsis induced 90% mortality and elevated levels of interleukin (IL)-2 (167 pg/mL ± 39 pg/mL vs. 68 pg/mL ± 2 pg/mL, p < 0.05), IL-6 (5,806 pg/mL ± 3,389 pg/mL vs. 0 pg/mL ± 0 pg/mL, p < 0.05), and IL-8 (492 pg/mL ± 22 pg/mL vs. 21 pg/mL ± 17 pg/mL, p < 0.05). Aspartate transaminase levels increased (227 IU/L ± 14 IU/L vs. 51 IU/L ± 7 IU/L, p < 0.05) in cecal ligation and puncture animals, whereas bile production decreased by fivefold compared with sham (436 μg/kg/h ± 247 μg/kg/h vs. 2,357 μg/kg/h ± 147 μg/kg/h, p < 0.05). Hepatic leukocyte adhesion increased threefold in septic animals (42.7 WBC per image ± 7.3 WBC per image vs. 14.8 WBC per image ± 3.8 WBC per image, p < 0.01), whereas leukocyte velocity decreased compared with sham (10.5 μm/s ± 2.2 μm/s vs. 22.3 μm/s ± 2.4 μm/s, p < 0.01). By contrast, aPC treatment reduced mortality to 60%, attenuated inflammatory cytokines, reduced leukocyte trafficking, and preserved hepatic function. Conclusions:: Our data demonstrate that sepsis may, in part, induce hepatic dysfunction by augmenting leukocyte trafficking into hepatic sinusoids. Treatment with aPC attenuated leukocyte trafficking and, in doing so, preserved hepatic function and improved survival. Collectively, these data suggest an important role for protein C-dependent leukocyte-endothelial interaction in sepsis.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2010.0

2-s2.0-77955950662,Article,"Background/Context: Perpetuation theory predicts that attending a racially segregated school paves the way for a lifetime of segregated experiences in neighborhoods, schools, and jobs. Research conducted in the 1970s and 1980s linked racial isolation in high schools with later racial isolation in many social settings among African-American students. Racial isolation in the workplace is particularly important to study given that it is an indicator of social cohesion and has been linked with lower levels of pay for workers of color. Purpose: This study updates much of this research, focusing on the extent to which young adults are racially isolated in the workplace for a more contemporary and racially/ethnically diverse sample. Research Design: Using the National Education Longitudinal Study, I conduct ordinary least squares regression with Huber/White/sandwich robust variance estimates and a correction for clustered observations. Findings: I find that the racial composition of high schools has a long-term effect on the extent to which young adults are racially isolated in the workplace. I find that exposure to other racial groups in high school-specifically, exposure to Asian American, Latino, and African American students for White students, and exposure to Latinos and Whites for African American students-reduces their racial isolation in workplace settings after high school. These effects are remarkable in that they are being detected net of measures of region, high school resources, and individual resources, and particularly net of residential isolation in the neighborhoods that the students lived in during the survey period. Conclusions: This study's findings are consistent with perpetuation theory, which highlights the long-term effects of attending segregated schools across multiple social settings. It offers additional reasons to be concerned about the resegregation of America's schools: as they resegregate, additional racial isolation in the workplace is expected to follow.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Sociology,2010.0

However, we still have an incomplete understanding of how people use visualization to think about information. We propose that people use visualization to support comprehension and reasoning by viewing abstract visual representations as physical scenes with a set of implied dynamics between objects. Inferences based on these implied dynamics are metaphorically extended to form inferences about the represented information. This view predicts that even seemingly meaningless properties of a visualization, including such minor design elements as borders, background areas, and the connectedness of parts, may affect how people perceive semantic aspects of data by suggesting different potential dynamics between data points. We present a study that supports this claim and discuss the design implications of this theory of information visualization.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2010.0

This is particularly true in countries like Egypt, where the modernist imagination of independence-era socialism seems to have been eclipsed by a grassroots vision of the future as a thoroughly Islamic place, and where the nature of the government's stance with regard to secularism and religion has long been an important question (Winegar 2009; Agrama, this CSSH issue). Since the late 1970s, a decade which saw the Iranian Revolution, the rise of televangelism in the United States, and the beginnings of an extraordinary wave of Protestant conversion in Latin America, it has become popular to produce histories of secularism that will help explain the failure of the secularization thesis, the idea that with economic development, the spread of education, and the advancement of Science, religion was a doomed commodity like pounce pots and butter churns. The moral vision of the popular long-running Star Trek mythology, in which humans as a species have given up religion altogether, seems ever more remote the closer its technological vision becomes. Surprisingly durable, religion refuses to wait quietly in the churchyard for people to visit. Instead, it stands on the street corner denouncing bad behavior and calling the world to salvation.

These longer oligonucleotides are in widespread use on microarrays, but there are few controlled studies of their interactions with mismatched targets compared to 25-mer based platforms. Principal Findings: 50-mer oligonucleotides with centrally placed single, double and triple mismatches were spotted on an array. Over a range of target concentrations it was possible to discriminate binding to perfect matches and mismatches, and the type of mismatch could be predicted accurately in the concentration midrange (100 pM to 200 pM) using solution hybridization modeling methods. These results have implications for microarray design, optimization and analysis methods. Conclusions: Our results highlight the importance of incorporating biophysical factors in both the design and the analysis of microarrays.

The purpose of this study was to investigate further the association between physical activity and hypertensive complications during pregnancy using data from a population-based surveillance system. Methods: This study included 3,348 participants from the 2004 to 2006 North Carolina Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System. Hypertensive complications during pregnancy were assessed using birth certificate data, and physical activity levels before pregnancy and during pregnancy were self-reported on questionnaires. Multivariate logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) while controlling for confounders. Results: Although no strong association was found between physical activity before pregnancy and hypertensive complications during pregnancy, a dose-response relationship emerged for the physical activity during pregnancy-hypertensive complications association after adjustment for prepregnancy body mass index (physical activity for 1-4 days per week: OR = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.45-0.90; physical activity for 5+ days per week: OR = 0.46, 95% CI: 0.20-1.02). When levels of physical activity before and during pregnancy were combined, a statistically significant protective effect was seen only for women who indicated that they were physically active both before and during pregnancy (adjusted OR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.44-0.96). Conclusions: In this population-based study, physical activity, particularly during pregnancy, was associated with a lower risk of hypertensive complications during pregnancy.

2-s2.0-77956341033,Article,"The formation of cracks is a fundamental first step in the physical weathering of rocks in desert environments. In this study we combine new field data from the Mojave (U.S.), Gobi (Mongolia) and Strzelecki (Australia) deserts that collectively support the hypothesis that meridional cracks (cracks with orientations not readily attributable to rock anisotropies or shape) in boulders or cobbles form due to tensile stresses caused by directional heating and cooling during the sun's daily transit. The new studies indicate that rock size, surface age, and latitude play important roles with respect to their influence on rock fracture. Rock size and pavement surface age exert an influence on the development of rock cracks as the average clast size of mature desert pavements may be at or below the threshold-clast size for thermal cracking of rocks. Latitude-controlled seasonal temperature variations play a key role, as demonstrated by: 1) tightly clustered mean resultant orientations that differ by latitude, as predicted in McFadden et al. (2005), and 2) very cold wintertime temperatures and strong diurnal gradients that may favor crack development in wintertime, given the likelihood for strong clast heating during early morning hours. The consistent evidence for meridional cracks in surfaces of diverse age and desert environments, climate, vegetation, and distance of clast transport indicate that directional insolation may play the key role in initially generating and propagating rock fractures, rather than a secondary role as implied in recent field and modeling studies of physical weathering in deserts.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2010.0

Objective. This study aimed to determine associations between symptomatic asthma and neurobehavioral comorbidities among children in rural United States. Methods. This cross-sectional study used data from 406 parents/caregivers of children aged 16 or younger, who completed survey questionnaires assessing their child's health status. Symptomatic asthma was defined as parents'/caregivers' report of physician diagnosed asthma and presence of night-time asthma symptoms in their children. The dependent variables were parents'/caregivers' reported comorbidities in children. Results. Symptomatic asthma was present in 9 of the sample. Approximately 26 parents/caregivers reported their child had one or more mental health problems and 13 reported one or more neurological problems. In multivariable logistic regression analyses, a statistically nonsignificant 50 elevated odds of one or more mental health problems were observed for children with symptomatic asthma (adjusted odds ratio [OR]=1.5, 95 confidence interval [CI]=0.63.5).

When the distance between two receivers is large enough, they can combine their interference sequences to recover the original data packets.

While many studies have analyzed the effect of various environmental factors on activity, we know much less about the genetic control of physical activity. Some studies in mice have discovered quantitative trait loci (QTL) influencing various physical activity traits, but mostly have analyzed inter-individual variation rather than variation in activity within individuals over time. We conducted a genome scan to identify QTLs controlling the distance, duration, and time run by mice over seven consecutive three-day intervals in an F2population created by crossing two inbred strains (C57L/J and C3H/HeJ) that differed widely (average of nearly 300%) in their activity levels. Our objectives were (a) to see if we would find QTLs not originally discovered in a previous investigation that assessed these traits over the entire 21-day period and (b) to see if some of these QTLs discovered might affect the activity traits only in the early or in the late time intervals.Results: This analysis uncovered 39 different QTLs, over half of which were new. Some QTLs affected the activity traits only in the early time intervals and typically exhibited significant dominance effects whereas others affected activity only in the later age intervals and exhibited less dominance. We also analyzed the regression slopes of the activity traits over the intervals, and found several QTLs affecting these traits that generally mapped to unique genomic locations.Conclusions: It was concluded that the genetic architecture of physical activity in mice is much more complicated than has previously been recognized, and may change considerably depending on the age at which various activity measures are assessed.",CHHS,Kinesiology,2010.0

2-s2.0-77956833156,Article,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide a more complete theoretical model of retail e-learning assessment module use. The location (i.e. onsite versus offsite) of assessment and prior experience is treated as moderators between motivation/intention, uses, and value; and differences between subjective and objective value are investigated. Design/methodology/approach: An exploratory, semester-long, single-course experiment was conducted using students (n = 37) from Mexico and the USA enrolled in a retail-focused marketing course at a university located near the border between the two countries. Findings: Extrinsic and intrinsic motivations predict participants' use of e-learning assessment modules. The objective and subjective value of assessment is strongly impacted by the individual's prior performance. Location of assessment moderator is significant. Research limitations/implications: In addition to focusing on intrinsic and extrinsic motivations, retailers should also consider the possibility that prior experience and location of assessment can affect use and value. Prior experience levels of the participants were found to affect use. Retailers are cautioned not to assume mistakenly that increased use of e-learning assessment modules results in lower performance. Rather, people that performed better in the past are less likely to use the modules. It is also found that when individuals can take the assessments offsite (e.g. at home, on the road), there is a positive impact on both objective and subjective performance. Retailers should examine the potential of permitting employees to take assessments from home (over the internet) or other remote locations. Originality/value: The paper highlights the fact that many retailers have adopted e-learning assessment technologies that include options for either onsite assessment (e.g. kiosks/PCs in human resource/training rooms) or offsite assessment that operations management and corporate staff can perform outside the office. However, little is known about what motivates people to use e-learning assessment, and how it affects performance across these two locations for assessment. Moreover, knowledge of how location of use influences the relationships is currently missing.",Business,Marketing,2010.0
2-s2.0-77956953912,Article,"Explanations of prison violence and other forms of misconduct have been dominated by three competing models: (a) the deprivation model, (b) the importation model, and (c) the coping model. We propose that these three seemingly competing models can be integrated within Agnew's general strain theory (GST). GST enriches the deprivation model by revealing three distinctive categories of strain. GST encompasses the importation model in hypothesizing that criminal cultural values and affiliations will structure the response to the strains of imprisonment. And GST incorporates the coping model in its emphasis on how social support, social capital, and human capital can blunt the effects of potentially criminogenic strains. Finally, GST is sufficiently broad to include factors (e.g., emotions, self-control) in the explanation of prison maladjustment not covered by the three main models of prison inmate behavior. In short, GST offers a general integrated framework for reconceptualizing our understanding of prison violence and misconduct.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Criminal Justice and Criminology,2010.0
2-s2.0-77956954966,Article,"Although scholars from across the field of communication have highlighted the importance of emotion in interpersonal relationships, persuasive messages, and organizations, the topic has yet to receive systematic attention from scholars who study classroom communication. Using interdisciplinary literature from communication and other fields as a foundation, the Classroom Emotions Scale (CES) was created to assess students' perceptions of emotional experiences in classes. Study 1 situates the scale within theory connecting emotions with classroom communication. The study reports initial evidence on scale dimensionality and connections between classroom emotions and three teacher communication variables: nonverbal immediacy, clarity, and communication competence. Study 2 extends those results by reporting a confirmatory factor analysis testing dimensionality of the scale; criterion and divergent validity evidence is also presented. Results of the two studies provide reliability and validity evidence for the CES, show that teachers' communication behaviors are related to students' reports of emotional experiences in classes, and document relationships between students' emotional experiences and various indicators of their motivation, affective, and cognitive learning. Findings are discussed as they relate to previous emotional response theory as well as philosophical works seeking to reduce binaries between emotion and reason. copy; 2010 National Communication Association.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Communication Studies,2010.0

Transportation planners are beginning to see great potential for carsharing in helping to create a more diversified and sustainable transport system. While it has grown quickly in the US in recent years, it is still far from the level where it can deliver significant aggregate benefits. A key element to the potential growth of carsharing is its ability to provide cost savings to those who adopt it in favor of vehicle ownership. This research seeks to quantify these potential cost savings. The costs of carsharing and vehicle ownership are compared based on actual vehicle usage patterns from a large survey of San Francisco Bay Area residents. The results of this analysis show that a significant minority of Bay Area households own a vehicle with a usage pattern that carsharing could accommodate at a lower cost.

The data were collected through a survey questionnaire in three school divisions in the Southwest region of Virginia of the United States. The results showed significant ethnicity-based difference in self-concept and in school engagement, but no significant difference in school belonging. The achievement differences were also significant, Caucasian students being higher on self-reported grades. In the regression model, self-concept was not a significant predictor of school outcomes, while school belonging had a significant relationship to school achievement for African-American students.

2-s2.0-77957112115,Article,"Previous genetic association studies of physical activity, in both animal and human models, have been limited in number of subjects and genetically homozygous strains used as well as number of genomic markers available for analysis. Expansion of the available mouse physical activity strain screens and the recently published dense single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) map of the mouse genome (≈8.3 million SNPs) and associated statistical methods allowed us to construct a more generalizable map of the quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with physical activity. Specifically, we measured wheel running activity in male and female mice (average age 9 wk) in 41 inbred strains and used activity data from 38 of these strains in a haplotype association mapping analysis to determine QTL associated with activity. As seen previously, there was a large range of activity patterns among the strains, with the highest and lowest strains differing significantly in daily distance run (27.4-fold), duration of activity (23.6-fold), and speed (2.9-fold). On a daily basis, female mice ran further (24%), longer (13%), and faster (11%). Twelve QTL were identified, with three (on Chr. 12, 18, and 19) in both male and female mice, five specific to males, and four specific to females. Eight of the 12 QTL, including the 3 general QTL found for both sexes, fell into intergenic areas. The results of this study further support the findings of a moderate to high heritability of physical activity and add general genomic areas applicable to a large number of mouse strains that can be further mined for candidate genes associated with regulation of physical activity. Additionally, results suggest that potential genetic mechanisms arising from traditional noncoding regions of the genome may be involved in regulation of physical activity.",CHHS,Kinesiology,2010.0

2-s2.0-77957227624,Article,"When does it benefit a firm to take a lead in innovation with information technology (IT)? How should a firm align its IT innovation with a dynamic industry? In addressing these questions we present a typology of IT Innovation and Environment Alignment (ITIEA) based on a firm's IT innovation strategic orientation and the industry environment. The traditional fit perspective predicts that a firm that matches its IT innovation with a dynamic environment would obtain performance benefits. In contrast, the options perspective suggests that a firm that takes advantage of a stable environment to proactively pursue IT innovation and develop IT capability as real options would obtain performance advantage. We employ a quasi-experiment design to test these two competing hypotheses using archival data of IT leaders over a time frame of 6 years. We perform a longitudinal analysis of the performance change trajectories of proactive and reactive IT leaders over time. The results indicate a general support for the options perspective that proactive IT leaders that lead in innovation with IT in relatively stable environments are found to consistently outperform reactive IT leaders in overall performance, allocative efficiency, and cost efficiency in management process. However, interestingly, the results also show a partial support for the fit perspective that reactive IT leaders that emphasize intensive deployment of IT innovation in dynamic environments are found to obtain a cost advantage in production and operation process over time. The findings offer practical implications for managers to better engage in IT innovations to create and sustain competitive advantage. Synthesizing options thinking and dynamic capability perspective, we provide a framework to better understand IT innovation, dynamic environment, and performance outcomes.

Second, we find that authors with no reputation at stake tend to be more bearish with their sentiment but, after controlling for selection, authors with more reputation at stake tend to be bullish in their sentiment. Third, we find that high-reputation authors tend to offer more accurate sentiments on the day their message was posted, which suggests day-trading behavior by authors, but that higher-reputation authors are no more accurate than others after the day of posting.

Methods: Two strains of inbred mice were used in this study owing to their high activity level (SWR/J) and low activity level (DBA/2J). Mice were housed in individual cages, and half of the mice in each strain had free access to running wheels in their cages, whereas the other half received no running wheel. All mice consumed standard chow and water ad libitum for 13 wk during the study period. Running wheel activity (daily), food consumption (biweekly), and body mass (weekly) were recorded. Results: SWR/J runners consumed more food (6.0 ± 0.4 g⊙d-1) than SWR/J nonrunners (4.7 ± 0.2 g⊙d-1, P = 0.03), DBA/2J runners (4.6 ± 0.2 g⊙d -1, P = 0.02), and DBA/2J nonrunners (4.2 ± 0.2 g⊙d -1, P = 0.006). SWR/J nonrunners consumed more food than DBA/2J nonrunners (P = 0.03). Average daily distance and duration were significantly greater for the SWR/J runners (6.4 ± 0.7 kmIdj1 and 333.6 ± 40.5 minIdj1, respectively) compared with those for the DBA/2J runners (1.6 ± 0.4 kmIdj1 and 91.3 ± 23.0 min⊙d-1, respectively).

However, when considering the individuals strains, the relationship between running wheel activity and food consumption was only statistically significant for the SWR/J mice. Conclusions: Higher running wheel activity in mice was associated with increased food consumption in the SWR/J mice but not in the DBA/2J mice. In DBA/2J mice, addition of a running wheel did not result in increased food consumption, suggesting that energy expenditure of nonwheel cage activity in the control DBA/2J mice was similar to the energy expenditure of the wheel activity because body mass was similar between the two groups.",CHHS,Kinesiology,2010.0
2-s2.0-77957369086,Article,"Recent literature on the use of soft balancing to counter the hegemony of the United States has focused primarily on middle powers in Europe and rising powers such as China. But what about weak states? Do they simply go along with the hegemon, or do they challenge its policies despite the odds? And to what extent does the soft balancing argument explain their behaviour? In recent years, several historically friendly African countries have used non-military means to undermine the unilateral policies of the United States. Leaders in South Africa, Kenya, Nigeria, Tanzania, Mali, Namibia and Niger especially have resisted US demands in areas such as the 'war on terror', the International Criminal Court and the US Africa Command. This article seeks to explain the strategies of opposition that some African countries have pursued. It finds that the behaviour is driven both by regional power concerns and by domestic political considerations. Interestingly, public opinion in these relatively democratic countries is motivated by disagreements with US policy and by resentment of the predominance of American power. Thus, the evidence both confirms and challenges the notion of soft balancing. On one hand, the behaviour of African states is driven at least in part by the global balance of power-directly, as leaders respond to power concerns within the continent, and indirectly, as citizens pressure leaders to resist the hegemon. On the other hand, these findings challenge the underlying premise that state behaviour is determined solely by structural concerns. Instead, the oppositional behaviour of African states has both systemic and domestic explanations.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Political Science and Public Administration,2010.0

Basal eudicots possess a wider range of floral morphologies than the core eudicots and grasses and can serve as an evolutionary link between core eudicots and monocots, and provide a reference for studies of other basal angiosperms. Recent advances in genomics have enabled researchers to profile gene activities during floral development, primarily in the eudicot Arabidopsis thaliana and the monocots rice and maize. However, our understanding of floral developmental processes among the basal eudicots remains limited.Results: Using a recently generated expressed sequence tag (EST) set, we have designed an oligonucleotide microarray for the basal eudicot Eschscholzia californica (California poppy). We performed microarray experiments with an interwoven-loop design in order to characterize the E. californica floral transcriptome and to identify differentially expressed genes in flower buds with pre-meiotic and meiotic cells, four floral organs at pre-anthesis stages (sepals, petals, stamens and carpels), developing fruits, and leaves.Conclusions: Our results provide a foundation for comparative gene expression studies between eudicots and basal angiosperms. We identified whorl-specific gene expression patterns in E. californica and examined the floral expression of several gene families. Interestingly, most E. californica homologs of Arabidopsis genes important for flower development, except for genes encoding MADS-box transcription factors, show different expression patterns between the two species.

To gain a general understanding of the functions of LexA and its evolution in cyanobacteria, we conducted the current study.Results: Our analysis indicates that six of 33 sequenced cyanobacterial genomes do not harbor a lexA gene although they all encode the key SOS response genes, suggesting that LexA is not an indispensable transcription factor in these cyanobacteria, and that their SOS responses might be regulated by different mechanisms. Our phylogenetic analysis suggests that lexA was lost during the course of evolution in these six cyanobacterial genomes. For the 26 cyanobacterial genomes that encode a lexA gene, we have predicted their LexA-binding sites and regulons using an efficient binding site/regulon prediction algorithm that we developed previously. Our results show that LexA in most of these 26 genomes might still function as the transcriptional regulator of the SOS response genes as seen in E. coli and other organisms. Interestingly, putative LexA-binding sites were also found in some genomes for some key genes involved in a variety of other biological processes including photosynthesis, drug resistance, etc., suggesting that there is crosstalk between the SOS response and these biological processes. In particular, LexA in both Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 and Gloeobacter violaceus PCC7421 has largely diverged from those in other cyanobacteria in the sequence level. It is likely that LexA is no longer a regulator of the SOS response in Synechocystis sp. PCC6803.Conclusions: In most cyanobacterial genomes that we analyzed, LexA appears to function as the transcriptional regulator of the key SOS response genes. There are possible couplings between the SOS response and other biological processes. In some cyanobacteria, LexA has adapted distinct functions, and might no longer be a regulator of the SOS response system. In some other cyanobacteria, lexA appears to have been lost during the course of evolution. The loss of lexA in these genomes might lead to the degradation of its binding sites.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2010.0
2-s2.0-77958454565,Article,"A country in question is positioned in the middle of a global technology race. To shorten its technology gap with the forerunner (North), this middle country must invest in imitative R&D. To exploit cheap labor in the technological laggard (South), it also must invest in South-bound FDI. A dynamic general-equilibrium model of three countries (North, Middle, South) is set up to numerically analyze how the Middle's refraining South-bound FDI affects international technology diffusion, international wage gaps, and international welfare. The Middle always finds a need to socially optimize investing balance between imitative R&D and South-bound FDI, while the South is instead in favor of as much South-bound FDI as possible. Interestingly, the North may, or may not, align with the Middle's tightening South-bound FDI, depending on how fast the Northern product innovation can proceed over time.

Presumably, regulators impose some risk management requirement such as VaR to reduce the insurers insolvency risk, as well as to improve the insurance market stability. We show that VaR requirements may better protect the insured and improve economic efficiency, but have stringent negative effects on the insurance market. Our analysis reveals that the insured are better protected in the event of greater loss irrespective of the optimal design from either the insured or the insurer perspective. However, in the presence of the VaR requirement on the insurer, the insurer's insolvency risk might be increased and there are moral hazard issues in the insurance market because the optimal contract is discontinuous.",Business,Finance,2010.0
2-s2.0-77958469803,Article,"This study builds on the scant research involving siblings of children with severe emotional disturbances (SED) and examines: associations between adversity experiences and adjustment among 5- to 10-year-old siblings, and relations among family resources, community life, and sibling adjustment. Caregivers from 100 families completed standardized indicators of sibling adjustment and scales reflecting multiple contextual variables. Results document negative associations between stress exposure and sibling adjustment. Regression models also indicate positive associations between the caregiver-child relationship and broader family resources on sibling behavioral and emotional strengths, even after accounting for adversity experiences; adversity exposure was the prime correlate in regression models involving sibling oppositional behavior. Analyses also suggest that strain related to parenting a child with SED is associated with sibling adjustment. This work documents the needs of these siblings and their family systems and highlights the relevance of not only core proximal influences (e.g., child-caregiver relationship) but also elements of their broader contexts. Implications and recommendations are described, including the need to support plans of care that involve services, supports, or preventive strategies for these siblings.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Psychology,2010.0
2-s2.0-77958469848,Article,"A computational method to identify residues likely to initiate allosteric signals has been developed. The method is based on differences within stability and flexibility profiles between wild-type and perturbed structures as computed by a distance constraint model. Application of the approach to three bacterial chemotaxis protein Y (CheY) orthologs provides a comparison of allosteric response across protein family divergence. Interestingly, we observe a rich mixture of both conservation and variability within the identified allosteric sites. While similarity within the overall response parallels the evolutionary relationships, >50% of the best scoring putative sites are only identified in a single ortholog. These results suggest that detailed descriptions of intraprotein communication are substantially more variable than structure and function, yet do maintain some evolutionary relationships. Finally, structural clusters of large response identify four allosteric hotspots, including the /β4/α4 loop known to be critical to relaying the CheY phosphorylation signal.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2010.0

Several 3D localized routing protocols were proposed to seek either energy efficiency or delivery guarantee in 3D wireless networks. However, recent results [1, 2] showed that there is no deterministic localized routing algorithm that guarantees either delivery of packets or energy efficiency of its routes in 3D networks. In this paper, we focus on design of a simple localized routing method which can provide energy efficiency with high probability in a randomly deployed 3D network. In particular, we extend our previous routing method designed for 2D networks [3] to 3D networks. The proposed 3D routing method is a simple variation of 3D greedy routing and can guarantee energy efficiency of its paths with high probability in random 3D networks. We also study its asymptotic critical transmission radius to ensure the packet delivery with high probability in random 3D networks.

Contemporary academic literature suggests that the answer to this question is no, concluding that states that afford their citizens basic political rights and civil liberties leave themselves more exposed to terrorist attacks (Piazza 2008; Wade and Reiter 2007; Pape 2003; Eubank and Weinberg 1994). American policymakers seem to agree. Both the Bush and Obama administrations regard the curtailment of physical integrity rights as a necessary element of effective counterterrorism policy. The Bush administration responded to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, with policies permitting indefinite detention, extraordinary rendition, use of physically abusive interrogation practices, and increased and largely unchecked surveillance and wiretapping of suspected terrorists. Although it banned abusive interrogation and announced plans to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, the Obama administration has maintained the practice of wiretapping, reserved the option of rendition, and dramatically increased unmanned drone attacks against suspected terrorists in Pakistan, which often results in civilian casualties.

Our objective was to investigate the prevalence of OC use among cigarette smoking women of reproductive age in the United States. Study Design: We extracted data from the 2002 and 2004 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System surveys of 76,544 women between 18 and 44 years of age who reported using some form of contraception. OC use, or self-reported use of "" the pill,"" was examined among those who currently smoke, either everyday or some days. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to compare OC use between smoking and nonsmoking women. Results: One fourth (26.9%) of U.S. women who smoke compared with 34.6% of nonsmoking women reported currently using OCs. After adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, marital status, education level, binge drinking, and health care coverage, women who smoke were 0.6 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.6-0.7) times as likely to use OCs as nonsmoking women. Among women aged 35 to 44 years, the odds of OC use among smokers was even further reduced (odds ratio [OR], 0.3; 95% CI, 0.3-0.4) compared with nonsmokers.

Previous research has suggested that people see parts of a visualization as objects, and may metaphorically interpret apparent physical relationships between these objects as suggestive of data relationships. We explored this hypothesis in detail in a series of user experiments. Inspired by the concept of implied dynamics in psychology, we first studied whether perceived gravity acting on a mark in a scatterplot can lead to errors in a participant's recall of the mark's position. The results of this study suggested that such position errors exist, but may be more strongly influenced by attraction between marks. We hypothesized that such apparent attraction may be influenced by elements used to suggest relationship between objects, such as connecting lines, grouping elements, and visual similarity. We further studied what visual elements are most likely to cause this attraction effect, and whether the elements that best predicted attraction errors were also those which suggested conceptual relationships most strongly. Our findings show a correlation between attraction errors and intuitions about relatedness, pointing towards a possible mechanism by which the perception of visual marks becomes an interpretation of data relationships.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2010.0

A CMV visualization consisting of a node-link diagram, scatterplot, and time histogram is described that allows interactive analysis from different perspectives, as some network anomalies can only be identified through joint features in the provided spaces. Spectral analysis methods are integrated to provide visual cues that allow identification of malicious nodes. An adjacency-based method is developed to generate the time histogram, which allows users to select time ranges in which suspicious activity occurs. Data from Sybil attacks in simulated wireless networks is used as the test bed for the system. The results and discussions demonstrate that intrusion detection can be achieved with a few iterations of CMV exploration.

The proposed ET model is introduced into a hillslope-based hydrologic model to predict the basin-scale hydrologic consequences of rubber replacing native vegetation. Simulations suggest greater annual catchment water losses through ET from rubber dominated landscapes compared to traditional vegetation cover.

Tracking algorithms that rely on image features to align virtual and optical images can fail when they encounter blurry image sequences. This is a common occurrence in colonoscopy images, when the endoscope touches a wall or is immersed in fluid. We propose a region-flow based matching algorithm to determine the large changes between images that bridge such interruptions in the visual field. The region flow field is used as the means to limit the search space for computing corresponding feature points; a sequence of refining steps is performed to identify the most reliable and accurate feature point pairs. The feature point pairs are then used in a deformation based scheme to compute the final camera parameters. We have successfully tested this algorithm on four clinical colonoscopy image sequences containing anywhere from 9-57 consecutive blurry images.

We have developed a phylogenetic motif (PM) functional site prediction approach that identifies functional sites from alignment fragments that parallel the evolutionary patterns of the family. In our approach, PMs are identified by comparing tree topologies of each alignment fragment to that of the complete phylogeny. Herein, we bypass the phylogenetic reconstruction step and identify PMs directly from distance matrix comparisons. In order to optimize the new algorithm, we consider three different distance matrices and 13 different matrix similarity scores. We assess the performance of the various approaches on a structurally nonredundant data set that includes three types of functional site definitions. Without exception, the predictive power of the original approach outperforms the distance matrix variants. While the distance matrix methods fail to improve upon the original approach, our results are important because they clearly demonstrate that the improved predictive power is based on the topological comparisons. Meaning that phylogenetic trees are a straightforward, yet powerful way to improve functional site prediction accuracy.

2-s2.0-78649284185,Article,"In most countries, physicians and other health-care providers play key roles in promoting health. Accumulating scientific evidence suggests that providers may soon want to include cognitive health among the areas they promote. Cognitive health is the maintenance of cognitive abilities that enable social connectedness, foster a sense of purpose, promote independent living, allow recovery from illness or injury and promote effective coping with functional deficits. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has established health promotion about cognitive health as a policy priority, with health providers included as one key group to participate in this effort. This study presents results from focus groups and interviews with primary care physicians (n = 28) and midlevel health-care providers (physician assistants and nurse practitioners, n = 21) in three states of the US. Providers were asked about their sources of information on cognitive health and for their ideas on how best to communicate with primary care providers about research on cognitive health. In results, providers cited online sources, popular media and continuing medical education as their most common sources of information about cognitive health. Popular media sources were used both proactively and reactively to respond to patient inquiries. Differences in sources of information were noted for physicians as compared with midlevel providers, and for rural and urban providers. Several potential ways to disseminate information about cognitive health were identified. Effective messaging is likely to require multiple strategies to reach diverse groups of primary care providers, and to include continuing medical education.",CHHS,Public Health,2010.0

2-s2.0-78649429996,Article,"Rail transit systems often provide park-and-ride facilities as a way for passengers to access stations. Using the land around stations for development rather than parking would allow more passengers to access the system without driving and ostensibly go much further toward reducing dependence on automobiles. However, it is unclear whether ridership levels can be maintained without a park-and-ride option. This research seeks to illuminate this issue with a demand model for the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system. Passenger counts are estimated for each origin/destination pair in the BART system based on such variables as parking spaces, housing units, and employment adjacent to stations. Parameters from this model are then used to estimate the amount of development required to replace the riders generated by station parking. Depending on the characteristics of a station and its spatial relationship with other stations, the level of development density required to effectively replace parking is found to be much higher than what is generally feasible.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2010.0

2-s2.0-78649720524,Article,"With urban population increasing dramatically worldwide, cities are playing an increasingly critical role in human societies and the sustainability of the planet. An obstacle to effective policy is the lack of meaningful urban metrics based on a quantitative understanding of cities. Typically, linear per capita indicators are used to characterize and rank cities. However, these implicitly ignore the fundamental role of nonlinear agglomeration integral to the life history of cities. As such, per capita indicators conflate general nonlinear effects, common to all cities, with local dynamics, specific to each city, failing to provide direct measures of the impact of local events and policy. Agglomeration nonlinearities are explicitly manifested by the superlinear power law scaling of most urban socioeconomic indicators with population size, all with similar exponents (~1.15). As a result larger cities are disproportionally the centers of innovation, wealth and crime, all to approximately the same degree. We use these general urban laws to develop new urban metrics that disentangle dynamics at different scales and provide true measures of local urban performance. New rankings of cities and a novel and simpler perspective on urban systems emerge. We find that local urban dynamics display long-term memory, so cities under or outperforming their size expectation maintain such (dis)advantage for decades. Spatiotemporal correlation analyses reveal a novel functional taxonomy of U.S. metropolitan areas that is generally not organized geographically but based instead on common local economic models, innovation strategies and patterns of crime.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2010.0

We develop a reinforcement learning based mechanism for multiagent meta-level control that facilitates the metalevel control component of each agent to learn policies in a decentralized fashion that (a) it can efficiently support agent interactions with other agents and (b) reorganize the underlying network when needed.

In addition, interference from collocated wireless devices operating in the same unlicensed frequency band may cause WLANs to become unstable, leading to temporary failures of access points. This paper addresses the questions of how to dynamically balance the load and how to quickly respond to instability in WLANs1. We present a new decentralized multi-agent load balancing framework for WLANs that uses DLB-SDPOP, a distributed optimization algorithm, to dynamically load balance the WLAN. The algorithm implements a less expensive pseudo-tree repair mechanism instead of complete pseudo-tree reconstruction when instability problems occur. It also leverages an efficient communication mechanism to control communication overhead in heavily loaded situations.

2-s2.0-78649956060,Article,"While the impacts of long-term climate change trends on glacier hydrology have received much attention, little has been done to quantify direct glacier runoff contributions to streamflow. This paper presents an approach for determining glacier runoff contributions to streamflow and estimating the effects of increased temperature and decreased glacier area on future runoff. We focus on late summer streamflow (when flow is lowest and nonglacier contributions to flow are minimal) of a small glacierized watershed on the flanks of Mount Hood, Oregon, United States. Field and lab measurements and satellite imagery were used in conjunction with a temperature-index model of glacier runoff to simulate potential effects of increased temperature and reduction in glacier area on late summer runoff in the watershed. Discharge and stable isotope data show that 41-73% of late summer streamflow is presently derived directly from glacier melt. Model simulations indicate that while increased temperature leads to rapid glacier melt and therefore increased streamflow, the consequences of glacier recession overcomes this effect, ultimately leading to substantial declines in streamflow. Model sensitivity analyses show that simulation results are most sensitive to degree day factor and less sensitive to uncertainties in debris-covered area and accumulation area ratio. This case study demonstrates that the effects of glacier recession on streamflow are a concern for water resource management at the local scale. This approach could also be extended to larger scales such as the upper Columbia River basin where glacier contributions to late summer flows are also thought to be substantial.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2010.0

2-s2.0-78650096706,Conference Paper,"For automatic object detection tasks, large amounts of training images are usually labeled to achieve more reliable training of the object classifiers; this is cost-expensive since it requires hiring professionals to label large-scale training images. When a large number of object classes come into view, the issue of obtaining a large enough amount of the labeled training images becomes more critical. There are three potential solutions to reduce the burden for image labeling: (1) allowing people to provide the object labels loosely at the image level rather than at the object level (e.g., loosely-tagged images without identifying the exact object locations in the images); (2) harnessing large-scale collaboratively-tagged images that are available on the Internet; and, (3) developing new machine learning algorithms that can directly leverage large-scale collaboratively- or loosely-tagged images for achieving more effective training of a large number of object classifiers. Based on these observations, a multi-task multi-label multiple instance learning (MTML-MIL) algorithm is developed in this paper by leveraging both interobject correlations and large-scale loosely-labeled images for object classifier training. By seamlessly integrating multi-task learning, multi-label learning, and multiple instance learning, our MTML-MIL algorithm can achieve more accurate training of a large number of inter-related object classifiers (where an object network is constructed for determining the inter-related learning tasks directly in the feature space rather than in the label space).

Therefore, it has been speculated that manipulation of a dysbiotic intestinal microbiota has the potential to restore microbial homeostasis and attenuate inflammation. Methods: We performed community composition analyses by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene to investigate the impact of the probiotic VSL#3 on colonic microbial community composition and development of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis in rats. Results: TNBS-induced chronic colitis was significantly reduced in VSL#3-fed rats compared to controls (P < 0.05). T-RFLP analysis revealed distinct microbial communities at luminal versus mucosal sites. Within the luminal microbiota, chronic colitis was associated with an overall decrease in bacterial richness and diversity (Margalef's richness, P < 0.01; Shannon diversity, P < 0.01). This decrease in luminal microbial diversity was enhanced in TNBS-treated rats fed VSL#3 (Margalef's richness, P < 0.001; Shannon diversity, P < 0.001) and significantly correlated with reduced clinical colitis scores (Pearson correlation P < 0.05).

2-s2.0-78650130087,"General Publications (Press, Editorials, Letters)","The relationship between physical activity levels and disease rates has become an important health-related concern in the developed world. Heart disease, certain cancers and obesity persist at epidemic rates in the US and Western Europe. Increased physical activity levels have been shown to reduce the occurrence of many chronic diseases leading to reductions in the burden on the healthcare system. Activity levels in humans are affected by many cultural and environmental factors; nevertheless, current research points to a strong biological input with potential genetic, neurological and endocrinological origins. Of unique interest, the sex hormones appear to have a very strong influence on activity levels. The current animal literature suggests that females tend to be more active than males due to biological pathways of estrogenic origin. The majority of human epidemiological and anthropological data, on the contrary, suggest women are less active than men in spite of this inherent activity-increasing mechanism. The purpose of this study is to review the current literature regarding the control of physical activity levels by the sex hormones in humans. Using the natural transitional phases of the aging endocrine system, natural periodicity of the menstrual cycle and pharmacological/hormone replacement therapy as variable experimental stages, some authors have been able to provide some information regarding the existence of an inherent activity-increasing mechanism in humans. In brief, activity levels during life stages prior to and after menopause do not significantly differ, despite the vast changes in sex hormone levels and function. Sex hormone differences throughout a regular menstrual cycle do not appear to influence activity levels in humans either; an effect that is pronounced in the female rodent. The use of hormone replacement therapies provides researchers with more systematic controls over hormone modulation in human subjects; however, this benefit comes with additional confounding variables, mostly due to disease or other states of malfunction. Despite the addition of these confounding factors, minor changes to the activity pattern have been observed in women, especially during the initial administration of the therapy. Observations are yet to be made in male subjects during replacement therapy. In general, some evidence exists suggesting that a biological mechanism extending from the sex hormones influences activity in humans. Unfortunately, despite a small number of investigative reports, the paucity of human research investigating how the sex hormones affect activity levels in humans prevents conclusive delineation of the mechanisms involved. Future research in this unique sub-field of endocrinology and exercise science utilizing more appropriate research protocols and effective techniques will provide definitive evidence of such mechanisms.",CHHS,Kinesiology,2011.0

Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that is known to inhibit inflammatory mediators. Objectives: We investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying interleuken-10 (IL-10)-mediated attenuation of O3-induced pulmonary inflammation in mice. Methods: Il10-defcient (Il10-/-) and wild-type (Il10+/+) mice were exposed to 0.3 ppm O3 or filtered air for 24, 48, or 72 hr. Immediately after exposure, differential cell counts and total protein (a marker of lung permeability) were assessed from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). mRNA and protein levels of cellular mediators were determined from lung homogenates. We also used global mRNA expression analyses of lung tissue with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis to identify patterns of gene expression through which IL-10 modifies O3-induced inflammation. Results: Mean numbers of BALF polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) were significantly greater in Il10-/- mice than in Il10+/+ mice after exposure to O3 at all time points tested. O3-enhanced nuclear NF-κB translocation was elevated in the lungs of Il10-/- compared with Il10+/+ mice. Gene expression analyses revealed several IL-10-dependent and O3-dependent mediators, including macro phage inflammatory protein 2, cathepsin E, and serum amyloid A3. Conclusions: Results indicate that IL-10 protects against O3-induced pulmonary neutrophilic inflammation and cell proliferation. Moreover, gene expression analyses identified three response pathways and several genetic targets through which IL-10 may modulate the innate and adaptive immune response. These novel mechanisms of protection against the pathogenesis of O3-induced pulmonary inflammation may also provide potential therapeutic targets to protect susceptible individuals.",CHHS,Kinesiology,2010.0

Univariate and multivariate analyses were carried out to compare ethnic groups and risk factors for severe obstetric morbidity and mortality using codes for conditions corresponding to the WHO definitions of near miss maternal morbidities. Results: African-American women experienced significantly more pregnancy complications (25.4%) compared to White (21.7%) and Hispanic (18.8%) women. The presence of medical comorbidities was highest among African-Americans (9.1%) compared to Whites (8.1%) and Hispanics (2.6%). Near miss mortality, however, was significantly higher in Hispanic women (5.9%) compared to African-Americans (4.6%), and Whites (4.1%).

It also provides an empirical analysis with outcomes that are contrary to most of those previously reported. It presents findings as a base for directing attention to a fundamental goal of positive behavior interventions and supports (i.e., teaching behavior as well as academic skills in efforts to prevent learning problems and failure in school).",Education,Educational Leadership,2011.0

General educators are responsible for providing primary instruction for students at risk for failure; however, the training they receive related to specific instructional strategies for these students is often insufficient (e.g., 1-day workshops). Alternative forms of professional development that include a combination of in-service and follow-up support have shown more promise in promoting changes in teaching behaviors.This study examined the effects of in-service support plus coaching on kindergarten teachers' accurate delivery of group instructional units in math. Teachers were trained to use a combination of whole-class instruction strategies, including model-lead-test for introducing new concepts and correcting errors, choral responding, and response cards. Results indicated that all teachers improved their delivery of instruction after the in-service training, with a second level of growth achieved after coaching. Teachers also reported high levels of satisfaction using the strategies.",Education,Special Education and Child Development,2011.0
2-s2.0-78650520974,Article,"Social networking is one of the major technological phenomena of the Web 2.0, with hundreds of millions of subscribed users. Social networks enable a form of self-expression for users and help them to socialize and share content with other users. In spite of the fact that content sharing represents one of the prominent features of existing Social network sites, they do not provide any mechanisms for collective management of privacy settings for shared content. In this paper, using game theory, we model the problem of collective enforcement of privacy policies on shared data. In particular, we propose a solution that offers automated ways to share images based on an extended notion of content ownership. Building upon the Clarke-Tax mechanism, we describe a simple mechanism that promotes truthfulness and that rewards users who promote co-ownership. Our approach enables social network users to compose friendship based policies based on distances from an agreed upon central user selected using several social networks metrics. We integrate our design with inference techniques that free the users from the burden of manually selecting privacy preferences for each picture. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time such a privacy protection mechanism for social networking has been proposed. We also extend our mechanism so as to support collective enforcement across multiple social network sites. In the paper, we also show a proof-of-concept application, which we implemented in the context of Facebook, one of today's most popular social networks. Through our implementation, we show the feasibility of such approach and show that it can be implemented with a minimal increase in overhead to end-users. We complete our analysis by conducting a user study to investigate users' understanding of co-ownership, usefulness and understanding of our approach. Users responded favorably to the approach, indicating a general understanding of co-ownership and the auction, and found the approach to be both useful and fair.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2010.0

The breadth of its product offerings has helped the company achieve unparalleled market reach; however, it has come with significant costs and challenges. By offering multiple similar products, a manufacturer increases its overall demand volatility, reduces forecast accuracy, and can adversely affect revenue and costs across the entire product life cycle. At HP, these impacts included increases in inventory driven costs and order cycle time, liabilities to channel partners, and costs of operations, research and development, marketing, and administration. Furthermore, complexity in HP's product lines confused customers, sales representatives, and channel partners, sometimes driving business to competitors. HP developed two powerful OR-based solutions for managing product variety. The first, a framework for screening new products, uses custom-built return-on-investment (ROI) calculators to evaluate each proposed new product before introduction; those that do not meet a threshold ROI level are targeted for exclusion from the proposed lineup. The second, HP's Revenue Coverage Optimization (RCO) tool, which is based on a fast, new maximum-flow algorithm, is used to manage product variety after introduction. By identifying a core portfolio of products that are important to order coverage, RCO enables HP businesses to increase operational focus on their most critical products. These tools have enabled HP to increase its profits across business units by more than $500M since 2005. Moreover, HP has streamlined its product offerings, improved execution, achieved faster delivery, lowered overhead, and increased customer satisfaction and market share.",Business,BISOM,2010.0

Design: Observational descriptive study of patient-reported neuropathy using a retrospective chart analysis. Setting: A hospital-based outpatient infusion center in the southeastern United States. Sample: A convenience sample of 171 patients with gynecologic cancer for a total of 302 chemotherapy treatments. Methods: A mixed model and compound symmetry covariance matrix was used to adjust for correlations between neuropathy treatment scores and patients who completed more than one chemotherapy cycle. Backward elimination method was used to determine the final model. Main Research Variables: Functional Assessment of Cancer Treatment/Gynecologic Oncology Group-Neuropathy Treatment scores, patients' demographic information, past medical history, and chemotherapy history. Findings: Patients who were physically shorter and heavier than the average population had the highest rating of neuropathy. Patients who were treated with nontaxane and platinum therapies had less neuropathy than patients who were treated with first-line taxanes and platinums. Neuropathy was noted by providers early in the course of treatment, and providers' grading was consistent with the patients' scoring. Conclusions: First-line treatments for gynecologic malignancies resulted in the highest neuropathy scores; however, patients who had received previous treatment with taxane and platinum therapies had lower neuropathy scores than patients currently receiving taxanes and platinums, suggesting that neuropathy improved after completion of first-line therapy and that second-line therapies were not necessarily correlative with worsening scores. Implications for Nursing: Nurses must educate patients about symptoms of neuropathy and the need to report symptoms. Nurses must recognize patients at highest risk for neuropathy and advocate use of validated assessment tools.",CHHS,Nursing,2010.0

These components are the seven transmembrane domain containing MLO/MLO2 protein and the syntaxin ROR2/PEN1, which act antagonistically and have been identified in the monocot barley (Hordeum vulgare) and the dicot Arabidopsis thaliana, respectively. Additionally, syntaxin-interacting N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor adaptor protein receptor proteins (VAMP721/722 and SNAP33/34) as well as a myrosinase (PEN2) and an ABC transporter (PEN3) contribute to antifungal resistance in both barley and/or Arabidopsis. Here, we show that these genetically defined defense components share a similar set of coexpressed genes in the two plant species, comprising a statistically significant overrepresentation of gene products involved in regulation of transcription, posttranslational modification, and signaling. Most of the coexpressed Arabidopsis genes possess a common cis-regulatory element that may dictate their coordinated expression. We exploited gene coexpression to uncover numerous components in Arabidopsis involved in antifungal defense. Together, our data provide evidence for an evolutionarily conserved regulon composed of core components and clade/species-specific innovations that functions as a module in plant innate immunity.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2010.0

Yet no study of an animal population has parsed the contributions of these three aspects of variability to long-term fitness. We do so using a unique database that includes complete life-history information for wild-living individuals of seven primate species that have been the subjects of long-term (22-45 years) behavioral studies. Overall, the estimated levels of vital rate variation had only minor effects on long-term fitness, and the effects of vital rate covariation and serial correlation were even weaker. To explore why, we compared estimated variances of adult survival in primates with values for other vertebrates in the literature and found that adult survival is significantly less variable in primates than it is in the other vertebrates. Finally, we tested the prediction that adult survival, because it more strongly influences fitness in a constant environment, will be less variable than newborn survival, and we found only mixed support for the prediction. Our results suggest that wild primates may be buffered against detrimental fitness effects of environmental stochasticity by their highly developed cognitive abilities, social networks, and broad, flexible diets.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Anthropology,2011.0

To reduce human effort, Automated Insight Externalization (AIE) is desired. Most existing IE approaches achieve automation by capturing events (e.g., clicks and key presses) or actions (e.g., panning and zooming). In this paper, we propose a novel AIE approach named Click2Annotate. It allows semi-automatic insight annotation that captures low-level analytics task results (e.g., clusters and outliers), which have higher semantic richness and abstraction levels than actions and events. Click2Annotate has two significant benefits. First, it reduces human effort required in IE and generates annotations easy to understand. Second, the rich semantic information encoded in the annotations enables various insight management activities, such as insight browsing and insight retrieval. We present a formal user study that proved this first benefit. We also illustrate the second benefit by presenting the novel insight management activities we developed based on Click2Annotate, namely scented insight browsing and faceted insight search.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2010.0

Given different types of interactions or constraints on interactions, a problem can appear to have different degrees of difficulty. While this relationship between interaction and problem solving has been well studied in the cognitive science literatures, the visual analytics community has yet to exploit this understanding for analytical problem solving. In this paper, we hypothesize that constraints on interactions and constraints encoded in visual representations can lead to strategies of varying effectiveness during problem solving. To test our hypothesis, we conducted a user study in which participants were given different levels of interaction constraints when solving a simple math game called Number Scrabble. Number Scrabble is known to have an optimal visual problem isomorph, and the goal of this study is to learn if and how the participants could derive the isomorph and to analyze the strategies that the participants utilize in solving the problem. Our results indicate that constraints on interactions do affect problem solving, and that while the optimal visual isomorph is difficult to derive, certain interaction constraints can lead to a higher chance of deriving the isomorph.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2010.0

In this paper, a multi-task structured SVM algorithm is developed to leverage both the inter-object correlations and the loosely-tagged images for achieving more effective training of a large number of inter-related object classifiers. To leverage the loosely-tagged images for object classifier training, each loosely-tagged image is partitioned into a set of image instances (image regions) and a multiple instance learning algorithm is developed for instance label identification by automatically identifying the correspondences between multiple tags (given at the image level) and the image instances. An object correlation network is constructed for characterizing the inter-object correlations explicitly and identifying the inter-related learning tasks automatically. To enhance the discrimination power of a large number of inter-related object classifiers, a multi-task structured SVM algorithm is developed to model the inter-task relatedness more precisely and leverage the inter-object correlations for classifier training.

The biochemical analyses are performed by repeatedly moving, mixing, and splitting droplets on the electrodes. Mixers and storage units, composed of electrodes, are two important functional resources. Mixers perform droplet mixing and splitting operations, while storage units store droplets that have been produced for subsequent mixings. In this paper, we focus on minimizing the completion time of biochemical analyses by exploiting the binary tree representation of analyses to schedule mixing operations. Using pipelining, we overlap mixing operations with input and transportation operations. We find the lower bound of the mixing completion time based on the tree structure of input analyses, and calculate the minimum number of mixers Mlbrequired to achieve the lower bound. We present a scheduling algorithm for the case with a specified number of mixers M , and prove it is optimal to minimize the mixing completion time. We also analyze resource constraint issues for two extreme cases. For the case with just one mixer, we prove that all schedules that keep the mixer busy at all times result in the same mixing completion time and then design algorithms for scheduling and to minimize the number of storage units. For the case with zero storage units, we find the minimum number of mixers required.

Many models for estimation of target concentration based on observed microarray signal have been proposed, but, in general, these models have been complex and platform-dependent. Principal Findings: We introduce a universal Langmuir model for estimation of absolute target concentration from microarray experiments. We find that this sequence-independent model, characterized by only three free parameters, yields excellent predictions for four microarray platforms, including Affymetrix, Agilent, Illumina and a custom-printed microarray. The model also accurately predicts concentration for the MAQC data sets. This approach significantly reduces the computational complexity of quantitative target concentration estimates. Conclusions: Using a simple form of the Langmuir isotherm model, with a minimum of parameters and assumptions, and without explicit modeling of individual probe properties, we were able to recover absolute transcript concentrations with high R2 on four different array platforms.

Specifically, both IQ and education were positively associated with breastfeeding rates, immunization rates, and rates of mammography screening, and negatively associated with teen fertility rates and infant mortality rates. Additionally, results confirm that education rates partially mediate the influence of IQ onto religiosity, and both education and religiosity partially or fully mediate the relation between IQ and state health (depending on specific outcome measure).

In adjusted models for adult children, medication adherence was associated with child's gender (odds ratio [OR] = 3.29, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.26-8.59), parent beliefs that the child had better hypertension self-care (OR = 4.36, 95% CI = 1.34-14.17), and child reports that the dyad conversed about hypertension (OR = 3.48, 95% CI = 1.18-10.29). Parental knowledge of hypertension and parent's self-efficacy were weakly associated with adult children's medication adherence (OR = 1.35, 95% CI = 0.99-1.84 and OR = 2.59, 95% CI = 0.94-7.12, respectively).Implications:Interventions should consider targeting African American older adults to increase self-care knowledge and empower them as a primary influencer of hypertension self-care within the family.",CHHS,Public Health,2011.0

The authors explore the relationship between military service and volunteering. They conclude that military service helps overcome barriers to volunteering by socializing people with civic responsibility norms, by providing social resources and skills that compensate for the lack of personal resources, and by making veterans aware of opportunities to volunteer as well as asking them to do so. Military service is positively related to volunteering among blacks and Hispanics. Married veterans are more likely to volunteer than nonveterans.

Using a measure of stable differences in how humor is expressed by individuals, the current research looks at the possibility that dating couples have similar humor styles, and at whether self-reported or perceived humor styles best predict relationship satisfaction. Individuals in a sample of 82 couples independently completed the measures of own and perceived partner's humor styles and relationship satisfaction on multiple indicators of satisfaction. The results indicate little similarity within couples on humor styles. The best predictors of satisfaction were perceptions of a partner's humor style, with humor styles that were other-directed explaining the most variability in satisfaction. The results demonstrate the usefulness of treating humor uses as a multidimensional variable to better understand the roles humor might play across circumstances and relationships.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Psychology,2011.0

However, the uncertainty of the relatedness between the images and the tags prohibit them from being precisely accessible to the public and being leveraged for computer vision tasks. In this paper, a novel algorithm is proposed to better align the images with the social tags. First, image clustering is performed to group the images into a set of image clusters based on their visual similarity contexts. By clustering images into different groups, the uncertainty of the relatedness between images and tags can be significantly reduced. Second, random walk is adopted to re-rank the tags based on a cross-modal tag correlation network which harnesses both image visual similarity contexts and tag co-occurrences.

In this paper, we build exploration models based on two considerations: inter-concept visual correlation and intra-concept image summarization. For inter-concept visual correlation, we have developed an automatic algorithm to generate visual concept network which is characterized by the visual correlation between image concept pairs. To incorporate reliable inter-concept correlation contexts, multiple kernels are combined and a kernel canonical correlation analysis algorithm is used to characterize the diverse visual similarity contexts between the image concepts. For intra-concept image summarization, we propose a greedy algorithm to sequentially pick the best representation of the image concept set. The quality score for each candidate summary is computed based on the clustering result, which considers the relevancy, orthogonality and uniformity terms at the same time. Visualization techniques are developed to assist user on assessing the coherence between concept-pairs and investigating the visual properties within the concept.

2-s2.0-79251478002,Article,"A complete understanding of the relationships between protein structure and stability remains an open problem. Much of our insight comes from laborious experimental analyses that perturb structure via directed mutation. The glycolytic enzyme lysozyme is among the most well characterized proteins under this paradigm, due to its abundance and ease of manipulation. To speed up such analyses, efficient computational models that can accurately predict mutation effects are needed. We employ a minimal Distance Constraint Model (mDCM) to predict the stability of a series of lysozyme mutants (specifically, human wild-type C-type lysozyme and 14 point mutations). With three phenomenological parameters that characterize microscopic interactions, the mDCM parameters are determined by obtaining the least squares error between predicted and experimental heat capacity curves. The mutants are chemically and structurally diverse, but have been experimentally characterized under nearly identical thermodynamic conditions (pH, ionic strength, etc.). The parameters found from best fits to heat capacity curves for one or more lysozyme structures are subsequently used to predict the heat capacity on the remaining. We simulate a typical experimental situation, where prediction of relative stabilities in an untested mutated structure is based on known results as they accumulate. From the statistical significance of these simulations, we establish that the mDCM is a viable predictor for relative stability of protein mutants. Remarkably, using parameters from any single fitting yields an average percent error of 4.3%. Across the dataset, the mDCM reproduces experimental trends sufficiently well (R = 0.64) to be of practical value to experimentalists when making decisions about which mutations to invest time and funds for characterization.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2010.0

This wide scope lends itself to potential epistemological and methodological fragmentation, which prevents scholars from adequately appreciating and building on each other's work. Although many scholars value PA's theoretical and methodological diversity, this intellectual diversity brings some important trade-offs that must be acknowledged. We see three future challenges for the field as (1) supporting the application of diverse and rigorous methodological approaches, (2) continuing to encourage theoretical diversity and theoretical depth, and (3) promoting relevance without compromising methodological rigor and theoretical depth. We believe that a self-conscious, deliberate focus on balancing these goals will strengthen and connect public administration.

Intrusive thoughts about the event are likely to be associated with continued distress, while deliberate rumination, aimed at understanding and problem-solving, should be predictive of posttraumatic growth (PTG). The Event Related Rumination Inventory (ERRI), designed to measure these two styles of rumination, is described and validation information is provided. Using a college student sample screened for having experienced highly stressful life events, data were obtained (N=323) to conduct an exploratory factor analysis that supported the two factors of the ERRI. Separate confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) on two additional samples (Ns = 186 and 400) supported a two-factor model. The two ERRI factors were validated by comparison with related variables and by assessing their contributions to predicting distress and PTG in two samples (Ns=198 and 202) that had been combined to conduct the second CFA.

An estimated 734 thousand oak trees occur on developed land in communities in the analysis area. The simulations predict an expanding sudden oak death (SOD) infestation that will likely encompass most of northwestern California and warrant treatment, removal, and replacement of more than 10 thousand oak trees with discounted cost of $7.5 million. In addition, we estimate the discounted property losses to single family homes of $135 million. Expanding the land base to include developed land outside as well as inside communities doubles the estimates of the number of oak trees killed and the associated costs and losses.

Significant negative correlations were found between maximum temperature in the dry season and the density of infected ticks in 2006 and tick density in 2007, but we did not find a significant relationship with nymphal infection prevalence in either year. Tick density and infected tick density had an indirect, positive correlation with elevation, mediated through temperature.

We model such time-evolving network as a weighted space-time graph which includes both spacial and temporal information. The aim of CETD is to build a sparse structure from the original space-time graph such that (1) the network is still connected over time between any two nodes, (2) the cost of the least cost path for any two nodes in this constructed structure is at most δ times of that in the original graph, i.e., cost efficient DTN routing is possible between any two nodes; and (3) the total cost of the structure is minimized. We first show that classic topology control methods for static graph do not work for this new problem and then propose three efficient topology control methods which can significantly reduce the total cost of topology while maintain the connectivity and cost-efficiency over time.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of 6 weeks of balance training on sensorimotor measures previously found to be deficient in participants with chronic ankle instability (CAI). BACKGROUND: CAI is the tendency toward repeated ankle sprains and recurring symptoms, occurring in 40% to 70% of individuals who have previously sustained a lateral ankle sprain. Recent studies have found deficits in sensorimotor measures in individuals with CAI. As balance training is a common component of ankle rehabilitation, understanding its effect on the sensorimotor system in individuals with CAI may enable us to optimize protocols to better utilize this rehabilitation method. METHODS: Twelve participants with CAI and 9 healthy volunteers participated. Independent variables were group (CAI, control) and time (pretraining, posttraining). Participants with CAI who completed a 6-week balance training program and healthy controls who did not get any training were pretested and posttested at the beginning and at the end of 6 weeks. RESULTS: The individuals in the CAI group who performed balance training demonstrated better performance than control participants on baseline-adjusted posttraining measures of dynamic balance in the anterior medial (P = .021), medial (P = .048), and posterior medial directions (P = .030); motoneuron pool excitability Hmax/Mmax ratio (P = .044) and single-limb presynaptic inhibition (P = .012); and joint position sense inversion variable error (P = .017). It may be of note that no systematic differences were detected for static balance or plantar flexion joint position sense tasks.

We consider different communication scenarios such as with single sink or multiple sinks, regularly-deployed or randomly-deployed sinks, with or without aggregation. For each scenario, we not only propose a data collection/aggregation method and analyze its performance in terms of delay and capacity, but also theoretically prove whether our method can achieve the optimal order (i.e.; its performance is within a constant factor of the optimal). Particularly, with a single sink, the capacity of data collection is in order of θ(W) where W is the fixed data-rate on individual links. With k regularly deployed sinks, the capacity of data collection is increased to θ(kW) when k=O(n/log n)or θ(n/log/W) when ω (n/log n) .

The evidence suggests that among the very largest and very smallest schools, football and women's basketball seem to be complements. For medium-sized schools, on the other hand, football and women's basketball appear to be independent.",Business,Economics,2011.0
2-s2.0-79951611983,Conference Paper,"With the widespread capabilities of commodity mobile devices, applications will increasingly incorporate participatory sensing functionality. Participatory sensing directly involves end-users in collecting (and ultimately sharing) information about the environment. Applications that rely on participatory sensing range from those that simply enable information sharing, to environmental monitoring and response, and route and behavior planning. As more and more applications demand the incorporation of participatory sensing, it becomes imperative to create software architectures, design patterns, and programming libraries that enable the integration of participatory sensing with software engineering theory and practice. In this position paper, we explore the new challenges that participatory sensing applications present, specifically focusing on challenges that demand a reevaluation of software engineering design principles, tools, and techniques. For these challenges, we also posit possible ways forward.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2010.0
2-s2.0-79951615902,Conference Paper,"Telesurgical robot systems (TRS) are often deployed in unattended environments such as battlefields or rural areas. Therefore, adversaries can easily access the devices, compromise the system, and install their own malware. If the integrity and health of the system software and configuration files are not verified before their usage, the safety and lives of the injured soldiers and patients may be in danger. Many existing software attestation mechanisms depend on the calculation delay to distinguish a correct memory image from a compromised system. We cannot directly apply this technique to transcontinental TRS when we consider the long transmission delay between the verifier and the prover. In this paper, we propose a software attestation mechanism that can distinguish between these two kinds of delay. A secure communication protocol among the verifier, telesurgical robot, and secure token of the remote medical personnel is designed. The safety of the approach is analyzed and its overhead is evaluated.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2010.0

Second, during the playout phase, the order of simulation move generators are hierarchically randomized before each playout move. Both dynamic randomization techniques increase diversity while keeping the sanity of the simulation game. The first technique, dynamic randomization of the parameters, increase the winning percentage of the author's program GoIntellect(GI) against GnuGo3.8 by 8 percentage points on the average in 19×19 games.

2-s2.0-79951785918,Article,"Carsharing is a vehicle sharing service for those with occasional need of private transportation. Transportation planners are beginning to see great potential for carsharing in helping to create a more diversified and sustainable transport system. While it has grown quickly in the US in recent years, it is still far from the level where it can deliver significant aggregate benefits. A key element to the potential growth of carsharing is its ability to provide cost savings to those who adopt it in favor of vehicle ownership. This research seeks to quantify these potential cost savings. The costs of carsharing and vehicle ownership are compared based on actual vehicle usage patterns from a large survey of San Francisco Bay Area residents. The results of this analysis show that a significant minority of Bay Area households own a vehicle with a usage pattern that carsharing could accommodate at a lower cost. Further research is required to indentify how these cost savings translate to the adoption of carsharing.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2011.0
2-s2.0-79951828754,Article,"Previously, we employed a Maxwell counting distance constraint model (McDCM) to describe α-helix formation in polypeptides. Unlike classical helix-coil transition theories, the folding mechanism derives from nonadditivity in conformational entropy caused by rigidification of molecular structure as intramolecular cross-linking interactions form along the backbone. For example, when a hydrogen bond forms within a flexible region, both energy and conformational entropy decrease. However, no conformational entropy is lost when the region is already rigid because atomic motions are not constrained further. Unlike classical zipper models, the same mechanism also describes a coil-to-β-hairpin transition. Special topological features of the helix and hairpin structures allow the McDCM to be solved exactly. Taking full advantage of the fact that Maxwell constraint counting is a mean field approximation applied to the distribution of cross-linking interactions, we present an exact transfer matrix method that does not require any special topological feature. Upon application of the model to proteins, cooperativity within the folding transition is yet again appropriately described. Notwithstanding other contributing factors such as the hydrophobic effect, this simple model identifies a universal mechanism for cooperativity within polypeptide and protein-folding transitions, and it elucidates scaling laws describing hydrogen-bond patterns observed in secondary structure. In particular, the native state should have roughly twice as many constraints as there are degrees of freedom in the coil state to ensure high fidelity in two-state folding cooperativity, which is empirically observed.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2011.0

2-s2.0-79951846242,Article,"In this paper, a structured max-margin learning algorithm is developed to achieve more effective training of a large number of inter-related classifiers for multilabel image annotation application. To leverage multilabel images for classifier training, each multilabel image is partitioned into a set of image instances (image regions or image patches) and an automatic instance label identification algorithm is developed to assign multiple labels (which are given at the image level) to the most relevant image instances. A K-way min-max cut algorithm is developed for automatic instance clustering and kernel weight determination, where multiple base kernels are seamlessly combined to address the issue of huge intra-concept visual diversity more effectively. Second, a visual concept network is constructed for characterizing the inter-concept visual similarity contexts more precisely in the high-dimensional multimodal feature space. The visual concept network is used to determine the inter-related learning tasks directly in the feature space rather than in the label space because feature space is the common space for classifier training and image classification. Third, a parallel computing platform is developed to achieve more effective learning of a large number of inter-related classifiers over the visual concept network. A structured max-margin learning algorithm is developed by incorporating the visual concept network, max-margin Markov networks and multitask learning to address the issue of huge inter-concept visual similarity more effectively. By leveraging the inter-concept visual similarity contexts for inter-related classifier training, our structured max-margin learning algorithm can significantly enhance the discrimination power of the inter-related classifiers.

The purpose of this study was to compare various hip, knee, and ankle joint kinematic variables between knee OA subjects and matched healthy controls during stair ascent and descent. Methods: Eighteen subjects with knee OA (age = 60.2 ± 9.9 yr, mass = 90.3 ± 16.7 kg, height = 168.4 ± 9.9 cm) and 18 healthy matched controls (age = 60.3 ± 10.7 yr, mass = 81.1 ± 21.2 kg, height = 168.3 ± 11.9 cm) participated in the study. Subjects performed five ascending and descending trials on a custom-built staircase while their motion was captured three-dimensionally using an eight-camera optical video motion capture system. Results: Significant group × direction interactions were found for average hip flexion angle at foot strike (P = 0.04), for average ankle adduction angle at foot strike (P = 0.01), and for peak ankle dorsiflexion angle during support (P = 0.05) and swing (P = 0.01). Specifically, knee OA and control subjects demonstrated greater hip flexion angle at foot strike and ankle dorsiflexion angle during swing but showed smaller ankle dorsiflexion angle during support during stair ascent compared with descent. Furthermore, compared with controls, knee OA patients demonstrated greater hip abduction at foot strike (-3.1° ± 3.9°) and smaller peak knee flexion during support (60.4° ± 5.0°) and swing (86.7° ± 5.4°). Time of peak hip abduction (34.2% ± 7.1%), hip flexion (7.0% ± 12.3%), knee flexion (69.8% ± 4.6%), dorsiflexion (51.4% ± 2.9%), and ankle adduction (37.3% ± 20.8%) during support occurred later in the gait cycle for knee OA patients. Conclusions: These data demonstrate that knee OA directly influences specific knee joint kinematics and induces kinematic alterations at the hip and ankle perhaps to compensate for the existing knee joint pathology.",CHHS,Kinesiology,2011.0

A framework is presented for understanding this complex relationship. Design: Findings are presented from a qualitative analysis of six 1.5-hour focus group sessions. Setting: The research was conducted among Latino women living in Chicago, Illinois, and Northeastern New York communities. We employed a community-based participatory research approach in which community members were active participants throughout the research process. Subjects: Subjects were 47 Latino women 31 to 81 years, all of whom were Christian and the majority (43%) of whom had less than a high school education. Twenty-seven percent reported having high school diplomas, and the same percentage reported at least some college. Of the women who answered the questions, one did not have health insurance, 69% had public health insurance, and 29% had private health insurance. Measures: Grounded theory using selective coding was employed to understand the relationship between spirituality and health and to develop the conceptual framework. Results: Spirituality was expressed as a vital component of health, and the belief in a need for balance of physical, mental, and spiritual health was described. An active and a passive relationship between spirituality and health emerged, with active being most common. Asking God for help or faith as a coping strategy were subdomains of the active relationship, and God responsible for health fell under the passive domain. These relationship types influenced beliefs about participation in one's own health. Conclusion: The findings that emerged contribute to an understanding of how spirituality plays a role in health beliefs among Latino women, which has implications for health promotion research and program development for addressing health disparities.",CHHS,Social Work,2010.0

A random sample of Iraqis residing in Southeast Michigan, US, was interviewed using an Arab language structured survey. The main outcome measure was self-rated health (SRH). Major predictors included socioeconomics, employment status, pre-migration environmental stress, and health disorders. Path analysis was used to look at mediating effects between predictors and SRH. We found that SRH was significantly worse among participants that had left Iraq after the 1991 Gulf War. Unemployment and environmental stress exposure were inversely related to SRH. There was a direct path between Gulf War exposure and poor health. In addition, there were indirect paths mediated through psychosomatic and psychiatric disorders to SRH. Another path went from Gulf War exposure, via environmental stress and somatic health to poor health. Unemployment had a direct path, as well as indirect paths mediated through psychiatric and psychosomatic disorders, to poor selfrated health.

Historically, at Bois Caïman, Vodou inspired Haitians to rebel against the French for their freedom, and more recently Vodou priests and priestesses have served as healers, counselors, and mediators between rival families. In a highly patriarchal society, Vodou empowers women by allowing them to bring female issues into the ""public eye."" Yet in the past three decades Christian missionaries from various Protestant churches have been swarming to Haiti, and unlike the Haitian Catholic church, which tolerates the presence of Vodou in society, they condemn the Afro-Haitian belief system, labeling it a satanic cult. The tragic earthquake has created new opportunities for the Christian missionaries. Seeking new recruits, the missionaries blame the devastation on Vodou practitioners, who, at times, question the integrity of their belief. Moreover, the Protestants control a substantial portion of foreign aid, schools, orphanages, and medical centers, which lures Haitians away from their indigenous religion.

We investigated how diet standardization and choline deficiency influence the composition of the microbial community in the human gastrointestinal tract and the development of fatty liver under conditions of choline deficiency. Methods: We performed a 2-month inpatient study of 15 female subjects who were placed on well-controlled diets in which choline levels were manipulated. We used 454-FLX pyrosequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA bacterial genes to characterize microbiota in stool samples collected over the course of the study. Results: The compositions of the gastrointestinal microbial communities changed with choline levels of diets; each individual's microbiome remained distinct for the duration of the experiment, even though all subjects were fed identical diets. Variations between subjects in levels of Gammaproteobacteria and Erysipelotrichi were directly associated with changes in liver fat in each subject during choline depletion. Levels of these bacteria, change in amount of liver fat, and a single nucleotide polymorphism that affects choline were combined into a model that accurately predicted the degree to which subjects developed fatty liver on a choline-deficient diet. Conclusions: Host factors and gastrointestinal bacteria each respond to dietary choline deficiency, although the gut microbiota remains distinct in each individual. We identified bacterial biomarkers of fatty liver that result from choline deficiency, adding to the accumulating evidence that gastrointestinal microbes have a role in metabolic disorders.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2011.0
2-s2.0-79952360180,Article,"Habitat destruction and extensive hunting drove the population of Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra L.) in Central Europe nearly to extinction. Due to conservation efforts, otters are now returning to their original habitats, including fishpond areas in the Czech Republic. As their populations grow, conflicts with fishermen arise due to significant losses of commercial fish stocks caused by otter predation. Since 2000, Czech fisheries may claim compensation for otter damages under legislative Act No. 115/2000. However, negative attitudes towards otters persist and their illegal killing remains common. In order to provide decision-support material for conflict reconciliation, we conducted a questionnaire survey among fishermen (n= 125) and conservationists (n= 36) to investigate stakeholders' perceptions of otter predation and the damage compensation scheme in the Czech Republic. Results suggest that although otter damages on fish stocks were smaller than those caused by other piscivorous predators, fishermen perceived them as a significant hardship and demanded active control of otter populations. However, only one quarter of fish farmers actively protected their ponds from otter predation and not all conservationists were able to provide advice on preventive measures. Most respondents were aware of the current compensation scheme but its actual utilisation, especially by small private fish farmers, was low due to a perceived bureaucratic burden. All stakeholders considered current compensations to be insufficient and expressed a need for additional measures. We identified deficiencies in communication between both groups of stakeholders, and a lack of knowledge and use of available damage mitigation options. Our findings show prevailing gaps in the conservation plan for L. lutra and suggest areas into which the effort of conservation planning, public relations, and environmental awareness campaigns should be targeted.

Our analysis shows that while in some environments, the manufacturer is better off with a far-sighted retailer, there are also environments in which the manufacturer is better off with a myopic retailer. We characterize equilibrium dynamic pricing strategies and the resulting sales and profit trajectories. We demonstrate that revenue-sharing contracts can coordinate the IDP's supply chain with both far-sighted and myopic retailers throughout the entire planning horizon and arbitrarily allocate the channel profit.",Business,BISOM,2011.0
2-s2.0-79952695473,Article,"Bacteria and their products are potent inducers of bone destruction. While inflammatory damage during conditions such as osteomyelitis is associated with increased formation and activity of bone-resorbing osteoclasts, it is likely that bone loss also results from the elimination of the cells responsible for matrix deposition. Consistent with this notion, we have previously demonstrated that bone-forming osteoblasts undergo apoptosis following bacterial challenge and that this cell death is due, at least in part, to the actions of TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). In the present study, we demonstrate that primary osteoblasts constitutively express death domain containing TRAIL receptors. Importantly, we show that cell surface expression of the death-inducing receptors DR4 and DR5 on murine and human osteoblasts is restricted to cells infected with the principle causative agents of osteomyelitis, Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella. In addition, we show that the robust constitutive production by osteoblasts of the decoy TRAIL receptor, OPG, is inhibited following bacterial infection. Finally, we report that while exogenous administration of TRAIL fails to activate apoptosis signaling pathways in uninfected osteoblasts, acute bacterial exposure sensitizes these cells to this ligand. Based upon these findings we suggest a model in which bacterially challenged osteoblasts express TRAIL while concomitantly decreasing the production of the decoy receptor OPG and upregulating cell surface death receptor expression. Such an increase in TRAIL bioavailability and induced sensitivity of infected osteoblasts to this ligand would result in apoptotic cell death of this bone-forming population, providing an additional mechanism underlying inflammatory bone loss during diseases such as osteomyelitis.",CHHS,Kinesiology,2011.0

Under these circumstances the factors underlying price variation can be inferred using a new methodology based on principal components. Analyzing ticket, parking, and concession pricing in Major League Baseball with this methodology demonstrates that general demand shifts are the primary factor, but explain only half of overall price variation.

2-s2.0-79952737029,Article,"Most of fire severity studies use field measures of composite burn index (CBI) to represent forest fire severity and fit the relationships between CBI and Landsat imagery derived differenced normalized burn ratio (dNBR) to predict and map fire severity at unsampled locations. However, less attention has been paid on the multi-strata forest fire severity, which represents fire activities and ecological responses at different forest layers. In this study, using field measured fire severity acrossfive forest strata of dominant tree, intermediate-sized tree, shrub, herb, substrate layers, and the aggregated measure of CBI asresponse variables, we fit statistical models with predictors of Landsat TM bands, Landsat derived NBR or dNBR, image differencing, and image ratioing data. We model multi-strata forest fire in the historical recorded largest wildfirein California, the Big Sur Basin Complexfire. We explore the potential contributionsof the post-fire Landsat bands, image differencing, image ratioing to fire severity modeling and compare with the widely used NBR and dNBR. Models using combinations of post-fire Landsat bands perform much better than NBR, dNBR, image differencing, and image ratioing. We predict and map multi-strata forest fire severity across the whole Big Sur fire areas, and find that the overall measure CBI is not optimal to represent multi-strata forest fire severity.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2011.0
2-s2.0-79952739488,Article,"We used FRET to examine the kinetics and thermodynamics of structural changes associated with ADP release in myosin V, which is thought to be a strain-sensitive step in many muscle and non-muscle myosins. We also explored essential dynamics using FIRST/FRODA starting with three different myosin V X-ray crystal structures to examine intrinsic flexibility and correlated motions. Our steady-state and time-resolved FRET analysis demonstrates a temperature-dependent reversible conformational change in the nucleotide-binding pocket (NBP). Our kinetic results demonstrate that the NBP goes from a closed to an open conformation prior to the release of ADP, while the actin-binding cleft remains closed. Interestingly, we find that the temperature dependence of the maximum actin-activated myosin V ATPase rate is similar to the pocket opening step, demonstrating that this is the rate-limiting structural transition in the ATPase cycle. Thermodynamic analysis demonstrates that the transition from the open to closed NBP conformation is unfavorable because of a decrease in entropy. The intrinsic flexibility analysis is consistent with conformational entropy playing a role in this transition as the MV.ADP structure is highly flexible compared to the MV.APO structure. Our experimental and modeling studies support the conclusion of a novel post-power-stroke actomyosin.ADP state in which the NBP and actin-binding cleft are closed. The novel state may be important for strain sensitivity as the transition from the closed to open NBP conformation may be altered by lever arm position.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2011.0

Our results imply that the permanent (random walk) component of stock prices overwhelms any temporary (mean reverting) component, producing a fractional d-value for returns indistinguishable from zero. We highlight the limitations of standard ACF models of overlapping returns, and suggest that the previously observed pattern of increasingly negative autocorrelations is largely an artifact of short-term ARMA dynamics.

This study examined prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test use among men and identified sociodemographic and health-related characteristics associated with its use over time. Methods. The National Health Interview Survey collected information on PSA test use among 16,058 men ≥40 years of age in 2000 and 2005. We examined two outcomes: (1) having had a recent (within two years) screening PSA test and (2) having had three or more PSA tests in the past five years (to indicate frequent use). Results. Marital status, family history of prostate cancer, and having seen a doctor in the past year differed over time in the unadjusted model. In the adjusted model, recent PSA screening decreased from 2000 to 2005 for single, never-married men, but increased for men with chronic diseases. Frequent PSA test use increased for men with a family history of prostate cancer, men with chronic diseases, and men who had seen a physician in the past year. Significant correlates of higher recent PSA test use included being older, married, and of black race/ethnicity; having higher levels of education and income, health-care coverage, and a usual place of health care; and increased comorbidity. Conclusion. Major organizations are not in agreement about the efficacy of prostate cancer screening; however, men ≥40 years of age continue to use the PSA test. Both recent screening and frequent testing showed variability during the study period and may have implications for the ongoing randomized clinical trials that are expected to clarify whether early detection of prostate cancer with PSA testing increases survival.",CHHS,Public Health,2011.0

Troop movement across the majority of the depositional environments on and around modern and older barrier islands, including Folly and Morris Islands, was impossible and the disastrous Union assaults at Fort Lamar (Secessionville) and Battery Wagner (Morris Island) were largely determined by the lack of alternate strategies available for attacking shoreline-perpendicular sand fortifications. The geology of the island also proved ideal for the Confederate defense, both in terms of the narrow dune ridges and the nature of the sediment. Well rounded and sorted quartz sand allowed rapid entrenching and minimized the effectiveness of an overwhelming artillery advantage of the Union field and naval forces. The character of the sediment was also favorable to Union sappers, and trenching ultimately led to the abandonment of Battery Wagner by Confederate defenders.

2-s2.0-79952902389,Article,"Purpose: Gottfredson and Hirschi, in A General Theory of Crime, argue that the primary source of self-control is parental socialization. Specifically, parents who fail to supervise their children, to recognize their child's deviant behavior, and to punish such behavior are more likely to raise children with lower levels of self-control. Recent empirical research, however, has broadened the explanatory factors to include sources within schools, neighborhoods, and individual factors as significant contributors to the development of self-control. This study proposes that maternal smoking during pregnancy places additional limits on the development of self-control. Methods: Using a subsample of the National Longitudinal Study of Youth (N= 542), we provide a comprehensive investigation of the variety of sources of self-control to include both individual and environmental covariates. Results: Results indicate that maternal smoking during pregnancy significantly impacts the development of self-control net of parental, neighborhood, and school socialization.

The presence of automation facilitated initial training performance, but hindered performance later in training. When automation support was removed, costs were seen for those trained with automatically-initiated automation.

Modern antibiotic-based therapy can increase the survival rate to ∼50%, but only if administered presymptomatically (within 24-48 h of exposure). To discover host signaling responses to presymptomatic anthrax, label-free quantitative phosphoproteomics via liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry was used to compare spleens from uninfected and spore-challenged mice over a 72 h time-course. Spleen proteins were denatured using urea, reduced using dithiothreitol, alkylated using iodoacetamide, and digested into peptides using trypsin, and the resulting phosphopeptides were enriched using titanium dioxide solid-phase extraction and analyzed by nano-liquid chromatography-Linear Trap Quadrupole-Orbitrap-MS(/MS). The fragment ion spectra were processed using DeconMSn and searched using both Mascot and SEQUEST resulting in 252,626 confident identifications of 6248 phosphopeptides (corresponding to 5782 phosphorylation sites). The precursor ion spectra were deisotoped using Decon2LS and aligned using MultiAlign resulting in the confident quantitation of 3265 of the identified phosphopeptides. ANOVAs were used to produce a q-value ranked list of host signaling responses. Late-stage (48-72 h postchallenge) Sterne strain (lethal) infections resulted in global alterations to the spleen phosphoproteome. In contrast, ΔSterne strain (asymptomatic; missing the anthrax toxin) infections resulted in 188 (5.8%) significantly altered (q<0.05) phosphopeptides. Twenty-six highly tentative phosphorylation responses to early-stage (24 h postchallenge) anthrax were discovered (q<0.5), and ten of these originated from eight proteins that have known roles in the host immune response. These tentative early-anthrax host response signaling events within mouse spleens may translate into presymptomatic diagnostic biomarkers of human anthrax detectable within circulating immune cells, and could aid in the identification of pathogenic mechanisms and therapeutic targets.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2011.0
2-s2.0-79953223256,"General Publications (Press, Editorials, Letters)","This book demonstrates how the forces of captivity and risk management dangerously co-habit justice at the self/society divide. This cohabitation is the power to harm (i.e., to reduce being and to repress becoming), for the kept and their keepers, for their managers and their watchers. This harm as ""madness"" occurs through interactive symbolic, linguistic, materially and cultural intensities. Overcoming these intensities or ""conditions of control"" for one and all necessitates the cultivation of transformative and dynamic habits of character. Embodying such citizenship makes the evolving praxis of social justice (as fair-minded and dignified, therapeutic and healing, restorative and communal) that much more possible. The theoretical, empirical, and policy dimensions of this thesis are examined by way of judicial decision-making that sustains captivity and risk management in three controversial total confinement contexts. These contexts include developmentally immature juveniles waived to the adult system and found competent to stand trial; psychiatrically disordered inmates placed in long-term disciplinary segregation where said isolation is not deemed cruel and unusual punishment; and formerly incarcerated sexually violent predators subjected to multiple forms of civil detention, re-entry surveillance, and communal inspection. The judicially endorsed harm that follows in each instance extends to victims, offenders, and the communities that bind both groups. The book concludes with a series of provocative, yet sensible, recommendations in theory development; methodology and future research; immediate and emergent praxis interventions; pedagogy and (continual) training; and institutional practice, programming, and policy. These reforms are relevant for the legal, psychiatric, clinical forensic, scholarly academic, bioethical, and human service/social welfare communities. Collectively, these change initiatives suggest several vibrant directions by which to activate captivity's release, to re-evaluate the risk management thesis, and to experience character's promise in our lives, in the lives of others, in mental health law, and in all expressions of dynamic human/social cohabitation.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Criminal Justice and Criminology,2011.0

Photosystem gene families exhibit retention patterns consistent with dosage sensitivity (preferential retention of polyploid duplicates and elimination of nonpolyploid duplicates), whereas Calvin cycle and light-harvesting complex gene families do not. We observed similar patterns in barrel medic (Medicago truncatula), which shared the older genome duplication with soybean but has evolved independently for approximately 50 million years, and in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), which experienced two nested polyploidy events independent from the legume duplications.

From a decision-making and policy perspective, undeniable benefits of GIS include the assessment of health needs and delivery of services, and also the appropriate allocation of workforce and prevention resources. Despite these attractive attributes, the literature suggests that there has been limited GIS uptake among health care decision makers. This paper presents a GIS-based Health Exploratory and anaLysis tool for Practitioners (H.E.L.P.) for the analysis and visualization of space-time point events, applied to hospital patients. H. E. L.

Methods: Subjects included 73 children (N = 42 males, N = 31 females) ranging in age from 7 to 13 years (mean ± SD age, 9.9 ± 1.7 years), and 65 completed all phases of the study. Subjects were randomized to one of three groups - low, moderate, or high fortification - with breakfast cereals administered in double blinded fashion. The ""medium"" fortified cereal contained B-complex vitamins, vitamins A and C, iron, zinc, and calcium, with the addition of vitamin E and higher amounts of vitamins A and C, and zinc in the ""high"" group. Immune measures included delayed-typed hypersensitivity, global IgG antibody response over four weeks to pneumococcal vaccination, salivary IgA concentration, natural killer cell activity, and granulocyte phagocytosis and oxidative burst activity. Subjects under parental supervision filled in a daily log using URTI symptoms codes. Results: Subjects ingested 3337 ± 851 g cereal during the 2-month study, which represented 14% of total diet energy intake and 20-85% of selected vitamins and minerals. Despite significant increases in nutrient intake, URTI rates and pre- to- post-study changes in all immune function measures did not differ between groups.

2-s2.0-79955398693,Conference Paper,"Action rules (or actionable patterns) describe possible transitions of objects from one state to another with respect to a distinguished attribute. Strategies for discovering them can be divided into two types: rule based and object based. Rule-based actionable patterns are built on the foundations of preexisting rules. This approach consists of two main steps: (1) a standard learning method is used to detect interesting patterns in the form of classification rules, association rules, or clusters; (2) the second step is to use an automatic or semiautomatic strategy to inspect such results and derive possible action strategies. These strategies provide an insight of how values of some attributes need to be changed so the desirable objects can be shifted to a desirable group. Object-based approach assumes that actionable patterns are extracted directly from a database. System DEAR, presented in this paper, is an example of a rule-based approach.

2-s2.0-79955526147,Article,"Sudden oak death (SOD) is an emerging forest disease causing extensive tree mortality in coastal California forests. Recent California wildfires provided an opportunity to test a major assumption underlying discussions of SOD and land management: SOD mortality will increase fire severity. We examined prefire fuels from host species in a forest monitoring plot network in Big Sur, California (USA), to understand the interactions between diseasecaused mortality and wildfire severity during the 2008 Basin Complex wildfire. Detailed measurements of standing dead woody stems and downed woody debris 1-2 years prior to the Basin fire provided a rare picture of the increased fuels attributable to SOD mortality. Despite great differences in host fuel abundance, we found no significant difference in burn severity between infested and uninfested plots. Instead, the relationship between SOD and fire reflected the changing nature of the disease impacts over time. Increased SOD mortality contributed to overstory burn severity only in areas where the pathogen had recently invaded. Where longerterm disease establishment allowed dead material to fall and accumulate, increasing log volumes led to increased substrate burn severity. These patterns help inform forest management decisions regarding fire, both in Big Sur and in other areas of California as the pathogen continues to expand throughout coastal forests.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2011.0

To investigate whether normal and malignant breast epithelial cells differ in their responses to oxidative stress, we examined the global gene expression profiles of three cell types, representing cancer progression from a normal to a malignant stage, under oxidative stress. Normal human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs), an immortalized cell line (HMLER-1), and a tumorigenic cell line (HMLER-5) were exposed to increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by treatment with glucose oxidase. Functional analysis of the metabolic pathways enriched with differentially expressed genes demonstrated that normal and malignant breast epithelial cells diverge substantially in their response to oxidative stress. Whereas normal cells exhibit the up-regulation of antioxidant mechanisms, cancer cells are unresponsive to the ROS insult. However, the gene expression response of normal HMECs under oxidative stress is comparable to that of the malignant cells under normal conditions, indicating that altered redox status is persistent in breast cancer cells, which makes them resistant to increased generation of ROS. We discuss some of the possible adaptation mechanisms of breast cancer cells under persistent oxidative stress that differentiate them from normal mammary epithelial cells as regards the response to acute oxidative stress.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2011.0
2-s2.0-79955624784,Article,"This paper examines the influence that the intrametropolitan growth in special districts has on residential property values. Our empirical approach tests whether the benefits of decentralizing local public good providers increases, decreases or leaves residential property appreciation rates unchanged. Past research in this area has been limited by the lack of variation in government structure within a region and by the self-selection of areas that decentralize governments. This research overcomes these limitations by 1) comparing appreciation rates for single-family homes that were located in areas that added local governments to appreciation rates for properties that were not; and 2) employing an estimation technique that border matches repeat sales to control for the self-selection of government structure. Overall, empirical results indicate that institutional decentralization has no influence on single-family property appreciation rates. It makes no difference whether the new government is the 3rd, 4th, 5th or 6th new jurisdiction-the new government does not influence appreciation rates. Residential property values for homes located in jurisdictions that added security special districts experienced rates of appreciation that were lower than otherwise comparable properties. Recreation, fire, water, sewer and other special districts had no measurable influence on appreciation rates. Empirical results also indicate that more overlap among local governments reduces appreciation rates. New governments created in areas whose residents have greater income heterogeneity increase appreciation rates. The distance separating the new government from existing governments, the land area of the new government and the creation of multiple new governments have no influence on appreciation rates. Finally, these results depend on the border matching repeat sales estimation technique employed here.",Business,Economics,2011.0
2-s2.0-79955667461,Article,"Background: Probes on a microarray represent a frozen view of a genome and are quickly outdated when new sequencing studies extend our knowledge, resulting in significant measurement error when analyzing any microarray experiment. There are several bioinformatics approaches to improve probe assignments, but without in-house programming expertise, standardizing these custom array specifications as a usable file (e.g. as Affymetrix CDFs) is difficult, owing mostly to the complexity of the specification file format. However, without correctly standardized files there is a significant barrier for testing competing analysis approaches since this file is one of the required inputs for many commonly used algorithms. The need to test combinations of probe assignments and analysis algorithms led us to develop ArrayInitiative, a tool for creating and managing custom array specifications.Results: ArrayInitiative is a standalone, cross-platform, rich client desktop application for creating correctly formatted, custom versions of manufacturer-provided (default) array specifications, requiring only minimal knowledge of the array specification rules and file formats. Users can import default array specifications, import probe sequences for a default array specification, design and import a custom array specification, export any array specification to multiple output formats, export the probe sequences for any array specification and browse high-level information about the microarray, such as version and number of probes. The initial release of ArrayInitiative supports the Affymetrix 3' IVT expression arrays we currently analyze, but as an open source application, we hope that others will contribute modules for other platforms.Conclusions: ArrayInitiative allows researchers to create new array specifications, in a standard format, based upon their own requirements. This makes it easier to test competing design and analysis strategies that depend on probe definitions. Since the custom array specifications are easily exported to the manufacturer's standard format, researchers can analyze these customized microarray experiments using established software tools, such as those available in Bioconductor.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2011.0

2-s2.0-79955750548,Conference Paper,"The simultaneous use of pre-segmented CT colonoscopy images and optical colonoscopy images during routine endoscopic procedures provides useful clinical information to the gastroenterologist. Blurry images in the video stream can cause the tracking system to fail during the procedure, due to the endoscope touching the colon wall or a polyp. The ability to recover from such failures is necessary to continually track images, and goes towards building a robust tracking system. Identifying similar images before and after the blurry sequence is central to this task. In this work, we propose a Temporal Volume Flow(TVF) based approach to search for a similar image pair before and after blurry sequences in the optical colonoscopy video. TVF employs nonlinear intensity and gradient constancy models, as well as a discontinuity-preserving smoothness constraint to formulate an energy function; minimizing this function between two temporal volumes before and after the blurry sequence results in an estimate of TVF. A voting approach is then used to determine an image pair with the maximum number of point correspondences. Region flow algorithm10 is applied to the selected image pair to determine camera motion parameters. We applied our algorithm to three optical colonoscopy sequences. The first sequence had 235 images in the ascending colon, and 12 blurry images. The image pair selected by TVF decreases the rotation error of the tracking results using the region flow algorithm. Similar results were observed in the second patient in the descending colon, containing 535 images and 24 blurry images. The third sequence contained 580 images in the descending colon and 172 blurry images. Region flow method failed in this case due to improper image pair selection; using TVF to determine the image pair allowed the system to successfully recover from the blurry sequence.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2011.0

2-s2.0-79955821150,Article,"Co-located optical and virtual colonoscopy images provide important clinical information during routine colonoscopy procedures. Tracking algorithms that rely on image features to align virtual and optical images can fail when they encounter blurry image sequences. This is a common occurrence in colonoscopy images, when the endoscope touches a wall or is immersed in fluid. We propose a region-flow based matching algorithm to determine the large changes between images that bridge such interruptions in the visual field. The region flow field is used as the means to limit the search space for computing corresponding feature points; a sequence of refining steps is performed to identify the most reliable and accurate feature point pairs. The feature point pairs are then used in a deformation based scheme to compute the final camera parameters. We have successfully tested this algorithm on four clinical colonoscopy image sequences containing anywhere from 9-57 consecutive blurry images. Two additional tabletop experiments were performed to quantitatively validate the algorithm: the endoscope was moved along a slightly curved path by 24 mm and along a straight path by 40 mm.

Methods Data on motor vehicle collision and injury statistics covering 2003-2007 were obtained from official sources provided by the Department of Traffic Safety and the Ministry of Health's Republican Medical Information Centre. The data were analysed and compared with data derived from studies in other low- and middle-income countries. Findings Large heterogeneity between data sources was noted. Motor vehicle collisions caused by drivers increased twofold between 2003 and 2007. Reported motor vehicle collisions, deaths and injuries increased by 34%, 33% and 47%, respectively, over that period. Such increases were proportionately greater than the growth in population or in the number of registered motor vehicles. The proportion of injury attributable to motor vehicle collisions increased by 14% and the collision-related mortality rate increased by 39% in 2003-2007. Conclusion In Kyrgyzstan, the number of motor vehicle collisions is rising and so is the number of those who are injured or killed in them.

In contrast to previous redirection techniques, this approach, based on a dynamic environment model, does not introduce any visual-vestibular conflicts from manipulating the mapping between physical and virtual motions, nor does it require breaking presence to stop and explicitly reorient the user. We conducted two user studies to evaluate the effectiveness of the change blindness illusion when exploring a virtual environment that was an order of magnitude larger than the physical walking space. Despite the dynamically changing environment, participants were able to draw coherent sketch maps of the environment structure, and pointing task results indicated that they were able to maintain their spatial orientation within the virtual world. Only one out of 77 participants across both both studies definitively noticed that a scene change had occurred, suggesting that change blindness redirection provides a remarkably compelling illusion. Secondary findings revealed that a wide field-of-view increases pointing accuracy and that experienced gamers reported greater sense of presence than those with little or no experience with 3D video games.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2011.0
2-s2.0-79956272996,Conference Paper,"Automatic indexing of music instruments for multi-timbre sounds is challenging, especially when partials from different sources are overlapping with each other. Temporal features, which have been successfully applied in monophonic sound timbre identification, failed to isolate music instrument in multi-timbre objects, since the detection of the start and end position of each music segment unit is very difficult. Spectral features of MPEG7 and other popular features provide economic computation but contain limited information about timbre. Being compared to the spectral features, spectrum signature features have less information loss; therefore may identify sound sources in multitimbre music objects with higher accuracy. However, the high dimensionality of spectrum signature feature set requires intensive computing and causes estimation efficiency problem. To overcome these problems, the authors developed a new multi-resolution system with an iterative spectrum band matching device to provide fast and accurate recognition.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2010.0

We then use this model to study the minimum connectivity (and design) requirements of networks for being robust against homogeneous faults within certain thresholds. In particular, necessary and sufficient conditions for most interesting cases are obtained. For example, we will study the following cases: (1) the number of colors (or the number of non-homogeneous network device types) is one more than the homogeneous fault threshold; (2) there is only one homogeneous fault (i.e., only one color could fail); and (3) the number of non-homogeneous network device types is less than five.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2011.0

This study investigated 12-week supplementation of 2 different doses of quercetin, combined with vitamin C and niacin, on body mass and composition in a large, heterogeneous group of adults (n = 941; 60% female, 40% male; 18-85 years of age; 45% normal body mass index, 30% overweight, 25% obese). Subjects were randomized into 3 groups, with supplements administered in double-blind fashion: Q500 = 500 mg quercetin·day-1, Q1000 = 1000 mg quercetin·day-1, and placebo. Quercetin supplements were consumed twice daily over a 12-week period, and pre- and poststudy body mass and composition measurements were taken in an overnight fasted state. A general linear model was used to predict change in body mass and composition across groups with adjustment for demographic and lifestyle factors. Plasma quercetin increased in a doseresponsive manner in both Q500 and Q1000 groups relative to placebo. After adjustment for confounders, no significant differences in body mass (males interaction p value = 0.721, females p = 0.366) or body composition (males p = 0.650, females p = 0.639) were found between Q500 or Q1000 groups compared with placebo. No group differences in body mass or body composition were found in a subgroup of overweight and obese subjects.

These differences are exacerbated by the shortage of Hmong American nurses. The shortage may be related to difficulty in navigating the U.S. education system. The purpose of this study was to examine the perceived impact of Hmong culture on Hmong American women's nursing education. Data analysis identified four themes that were confirmed by participants: support factors, entrepreneurism, positive outcomes, and cultural expectations. On the basis of these themes, schools of nursing can positively influence Hmong American women's education by providing information sessions for their families regarding school expectations, allowing flexibility in meeting course requirements, increasing the number of Hmong and minority faculty members, and providing language assessment and support programs for English language learners.",CHHS,Nursing,2011.0
2-s2.0-79957466969,Article,"While anthropological research has noted a connection between domestic violence and heightened risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), few studies have attempted to provide a theoretically-based explanation of this correlation. The current mixed-method research, conducted in southern New England, tests two prominent theories with the potential to explain this association: social control theory and resource access theory. Text analysis of in-depth, life history interviews with 28 abused women and multiple regression analysis of data from 215 structured interviews from abused and non-abused women allow us to conclude that, as posited by resource access theory, a woman's level of power (i.e., access to resources) effectively predicts whether she will experience violence and associated STI/HIV risks or affection and minimized sexual risk. Abused women who lack access to positive resources (e.g., support of friends/family, counseling, independent income) are more likely to engage in sexually risky behaviors, while women empowered with such resources are better able to avoid abuse and mitigate its sequelae. Therefore, experiences of domestic violence need not necessitate STI/HIV risk. Specific suggestions for policy and treatment modifications are suggested based on these findings.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Anthropology,2011.0

2-s2.0-79957511356,Article,"The increasing availability of large quantities of user contributed images with labels has provided opportunities to develop automatic tools to tag images to facilitate image search and retrieval. In this paper, we present a novel hybrid probabilistic model (HPM) which integrates low-level image features and high-level user provided tags to automatically tag images. For images without any tags, HPM predicts new tags based solely on the low-level image features. For images with user provided tags, HPM jointly exploits both the image features and the tags in a unified probabilistic framework to recommend additional tags to label the images. The HPM framework makes use of the tag-image association matrix (TIAM). However, since the number of images is usually very large and user-provided tags are diverse, TIAM is very sparse, thus making it difficult to reliably estimate tag-to-tag co-occurrence probabilities. We developed a collaborative filtering method based on nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) for tackling this data sparsity issue. Also, an L-1 norm kernel method is used to estimate the correlations between image features and semantic concepts. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been evaluated using three databases containing 5,000 images with 371 tags, 31,695 images with 5,587 tags, and 269,648 images with 5,018 tags, respectively.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2011.0

As a result of computer storage and runtime constraints, previous approaches have only considered small-to-moderate scale problem scenarios, generally employing exact hypercube queuing models integrated into optimization procedures. We overcome these limitations here by embedding a fast and accurate hypercube approximation algorithm adapted for partial backup dispatch policies in single- and multi-start greedy heuristics. The proposed methods are tested on small-to-large-scale problems involving up to 100 ambulances.

Our results indicate that when using the rotation technique, participants spatially updated both their virtual and real world orientations during redirection, resulting in pointing accuracy to the targets' recomputed positions that was strikingly similar to the control condition.

They were also to ensure that additional assessment and intervention was provided when needed. The degree to which this mandate has been implemented varies widely between state and local programs. Some early intervention experts and Part C program administrators have expressed concerns about providers' willingness to serve families referred from child welfare, but there has been no systematic research on this issue. The Professional Interventionist CAPTA Survey (PICS) is a newly developed measure of early childhood intervention providers' perceptions of their responsibilities under CAPTA. The first aim of this study was to conduct analysis of the PICS using a national sample of providers.

Our objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness of implementing early goal-directed therapy as a routine protocol. Design: Prospective before and after study. Setting: Large urban hospital emergency department with >110,000 visits/yr. Patients: The target population was patients with consensus criteria for septic shock. We excluded those with age <18 yrs, no aggressive care desired, or need for immediate surgery. Interventions: Clinical and cost data were prospectively collected on two groups: 1) patients from 1 yr before; and 2) 2 yrs after implementing early goal-directed therapy as standard of care. Before phase patients received nonprotocolized care at attending discretion. The primary outcomes were 1-yr mortality, discounted life expectancy, and quality-adjusted life-years. Using costs and quality-adjusted life-years, we constructed an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and performed a net monetary benefit analysis, producing the probability that the intervention was cost-effective given different values for the willingness to pay for a quality-adjusted life-year. RESULTS:: Two hundred eighty-five subjects, 79 in the before and 206 in the after phases, were enrolled. Treatment with early goal-directed therapy was associated with an increased hospital cost of $7,028 and an increase in both discounted sepsis-adjusted life expectancy and quality-adjusted life years of 1.5 and 1.3 yrs, respectively. Early goal-directed therapy use was associated with a cost of $5,397 per quality-adjusted life-years gained and the net monetary benefit analysis indicates a 98% probability (p = .038) that early goal-directed therapy is cost-effective at a willingness to pay of $50,000 per quality-adjusted life-years.

This study documented 2nd-grade students' oral reading rates on the basis of fall, winter, and spring assessments. Using growth curve analysis, we identified models for a sample (n = 5,796) of students in 79 schools in a large urban school district in the United States. We found that, although school characteristics were significant predictors of the children's initial oral reading status, they were mostly not significant predictors of their reading rate over time. At the individual level, girls had a better performance than did boys in reading achievement testing, and no statistically significant difference was noted between boys and girls in their growth rates during the 2nd grade. On the other hand, special education children not only achieved less than did non-special education children in oral reading but also evidenced a significantly lower rate of increase. The trustworthiness of ""at risk"" and ""low risk"" instructional recommendations on the basis of oral reading rates was high.

We re-analyzed data from the 25 studies used in the prior meta-analyses, correcting statistical and methodological limitations of previous efforts, and analyzed the chronicity data by discrete epochs.

The addition of a frozen conflict situation, where international recognition of boundaries and authorities are lacking, introduces further complexities. Case description. Nagorno Karabagh (NK) is an ethnically Armenian territory locked within post-Soviet Azerbaijan and one such frozen conflict situation. This article highlights the use of evidence-based practice and community engagement to determine priority areas for health care training in NK. Drawing on the precepts of APEXPH (Assessment Protocol for Excellence in Public Health) and MAPP (Mobilizing for Action through Planning and Partnerships), this first-of-its-kind assessment in NK relied on in-depth interviews and focus group discussions supplemented with expert assessments and field observations. Training options were evaluated against a series of ethical and pragmatic principles. Discussion and Evaluation. A unique factor among the ethical and pragmatic considerations when prioritizing among alternatives was NK's ambiguous political status and consequent sponsor constraints. Training priorities differed across the region and by type of provider, but consensus prioritization emerged for first aid, clinical Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses, and Adult Disease Management. These priorities were then incorporated into the training programs funded by the sponsor. Conclusions: Programming responsive to both the evidence-base and stakeholder priorities is always desirable and provides a foundation for long-term planning and response. In frozen conflict, low resource settings, such an approach is critical to balancing the community's immediate humanitarian needs with sponsor concerns and constraints.",CHHS,Public Health,2010.0

We evaluate the performance of Push, Pull, and Advance-purchase discount (APD) contracts in a manufacturer-retailer supply chain where one or both firms have a satisficing objective of maximizing the probability of achieving a target profit. We identify the resulting operational modes of the supply chain and potential conflicts over the preferred contracts under the Push, Pull, and APD contracts. When both firms are satisficing, conflict over the preferred contract arises when the manufacturer has an ambitious profit target or the retailer has a low profit target. We show that the Push contract can result in a large decrease in the expected profit of a risk-neutral manufacturer when the retailer maximizes the probability of achieving her maximum expected profit. We find that a modified buy-back and profit guarantee contracts can provide significant Pareto improvement over Push or APD contracts when the manufacturer is risk-neutral and the retailer is satisficing, while revenue-sharing contracts cannot.

Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), following transdifferentiation, are the central mediators of hepatic fibrosis through increased secretion of ECM components, including type I collagen. Aims: The mechanism(s) by which the antioxidant S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAMe) acts to modulate type I collagen secretion in activated HSCs was examined. Methods: Hepatic stellate cells were culture-activated for 13-15 days and treated with SAMe. Type I collagen, proteasomal activity and resident endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein [78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (Grp78) and protein disulphide isomerase (PDI)] expression were measured. Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activity, and its role in SAMe-mediated collagen inhibition, was determined. Type I collagen polyubiquitination was examined. Results: S-adenosyl-l-methionine significantly inhibited type I collagen secretion without significant changes in type I collagen mRNA expression. SAMe also increased NF-κB activity, and blocking NF-κB activity using a dominant-negative IκBα abolished the SAMe-mediated type I collagen secretion. Examination of the post-transcriptional fate of procollagen demonstrated that SAMe treatment led to intracellular type I collagen polyubiquitination accompanied by diminution of proteasomal activity. Expression of Grp78 and PDI (resident ER proteins) were significantly decreased by SAMe treatment.

The latter expects a result that is updated over time to reflect changes in the system. The fidelity, or quality, of the results of these queries can be significantly impacted by the unpredictability of the dynamic network; as the query is distributed and executed, changes that occur due to network and environmental dynamics can cause the query to miss potential results or to report inconsistent information. Our previous work has shown how we can provide semantically meaningful statements about the fidelity, or quality, of the result of a snapshot query in a dynamic networked environment. In this paper, we demonstrate how this fidelity can also be used to adapt a continuous query's processing to make its execution best match the conditions in the underlying dynamic environment.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2011.0
2-s2.0-79958106905,Conference Paper,"Understanding audience responses to art and performance is a challenge. New sensors are promising for measurement of implicit and explicit audience engagement. However, the meaning of biometric data, and its relationship to engagement, is unclear. We conceptually explore the audience engagement domain to uncover opportunities and challenges in the assessment and interpretation of audience engagement data. We developed a display that linked performance videos with audience biometric data and presented it to 7 performing arts experts, to explore the measurement, interpretation and application of biometric data. Experts were intrigued by the response data and reflective in interpreting it. We deepened our inquiry with an empirical study with 49 participants who watched a video of a dance performance. We related temporal galvanic skin response (GSR) data to two self-report scales, which provided insights on interpreting this measure. Our findings, which include strong correlations, support the interpretation of GSR as a valid representation of audience engagement.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2011.0

We find evidence to the contrary. We use broad-based index exchange-traded funds for our analysis and the Sharpe ratio to compare returns. The magnitude of this effect is startling. For example, the geometric average close-to-open (CO) risk premium (return minus the risk-free rate) of the QQQQ from 1999-2006 was +23.7 per cent whereas the average open-to-close risk premium was -23.3 per cent with lower volatility for the CO risk premium.

Using data from the National Education Longitudinal Study, this article disaggregates achievement into achievement prior to high school (in the eighth grade) and changes in achievement during high school. The authors find that the prestige of the colleges that students attend is largely solidified by the time students enter high school. They also find that among high socioeconomic status (SES) students, lower achievers can enhance the prestige of the colleges they will attend by moving up the achievement distribution during high school. However, even if their gains are well above average, the prestige of the colleges they are predicted to attend will not surpass students who enter high school at the top or middle of the eighth-grade achievement distribution. These findings are similar for low-SES students. In contrast, the effects of achievement for middle-SES students are largely solidified by high school.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Sociology,2011.0

Our approach applies the pedagogical methods learned from toy construction sets by treating security primitives as Lego pieces and protocols as construction results. Simulating the Lego toys, the digital Legos use matching shapes to help students understand the relationships among security primitives and protocols. Specifically, we present a flexible Lego generation method that can use various intuitive shapes to represent abstract and complex security protocols. Our design allows easy generation of new Lego sets and creation of different course materials.

FLX/454 sequencing carried out on a normalized cDNA pool prepared from 31 tissues produced 494 353 short transcript reads (STRs). Cluster analysis of these STRs, together with 10 817 Sanger ESTs, resulted in a pigeonpea trancriptome assembly (CcTA) comprising of 127 754 tentative unique sequences (TUSs). Functional analysis of these TUSs highlights several active pathways and processes in the sampled tissues. Comparison of the CcTA with the soybean genome showed similarity to 10 857 and 16 367 soybean gene models (depending on alignment methods). Additionally, Illumina 1G sequencing was performed on Fusarium wilt (FW)- and sterility mosaic disease (SMD)-challenged root tissues of 10 resistant and susceptible genotypes. More than 160 million sequence tags were used to identify FW- and SMD-responsive genes. Sequence analysis of CcTA and the Illumina tags identified a large new set of markers for use in genetics and breeding, including 8137 simple sequence repeats, 12 141 single-nucleotide polymorphisms and 5845 intron-spanning regions.

Even though a poor diet and lack of physical activity are attributable factors to being overweight among children, indications exists that geographic location may also be important. In rural areas in the United States, childhood obesity is often higher than the national average. This study analyzed dietary, physical, activity, and life-style behaviors of rural African American children and their risk for becoming overweight. This study is a cross-sectional convenience sample of 98 students from a rural county in South Carolina in 2002. Findings showed rural female children were significantly more likely than rural male children to engage in physical activity for at least 20 minutes per day (odds ratio, 5.57; p = .0056). Given the increase in the prevalence of obesity especially among minority populations, the need exists to develop culturally appropriate nutrition and exercise interventions to assist children in a healthy weight loss attempt.

2-s2.0-79959259983,Article,"Background: Although dozens of algorithms and tools have been developed to find a set of cis-regulatory binding sites called a motif in a set of intergenic sequences using various approaches, most of these tools focus on identifying binding sites that are significantly different from their background sequences. However, some motifs may have a similar nucleotide distribution to that of their background sequences. Therefore, such binding sites can be missed by these tools.Results: Here, we present a graph-based polynomial-time algorithm, MotifClick, for the prediction of cis-regulatory binding sites, in particular, those that have a similar nucleotide distribution to that of their background sequences. To find binding sites with length k, we construct a graph using some 2(k-1)-mers in the input sequences as the vertices, and connect two vertices by an edge if the maximum number of matches of the local gapless alignments between the two 2(k-1)-mers is greater than a cutoff value. We identify a motif as a set of similar k-mers from a merged group of maximum cliques associated with some vertices.Conclusions: When evaluated on both synthetic and real datasets of prokaryotes and eukaryotes, MotifClick outperforms existing leading motif-finding tools for prediction accuracy and balancing the prediction sensitivity and specificity in general. In particular, when the distribution of nucleotides of binding sites is similar to that of their background sequences, MotifClick is more likely to identify the binding sites than the other tools.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2011.0
2-s2.0-79959263597,Article,"A number of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) recently have been discovered that affect various activity traits in mice, but their collective impact does not appear to explain the consistently moderate to high heritabilities for these traits. We previously suggested interactions of genes, or epistasis, might account for additional genetic variability of activity, and tested this for the average distance, duration and speed run by mice during a 3 week period. We found abundant evidence for epistasis affecting these traits, although, recognized that epistatic effects may well vary within individuals over time. We therefore conducted a full genome scan for epistatic interactions affecting these traits in each of seven three-day intervals. Our intent was to assess the extent and trends in epistasis affecting these traits in each of the intervals. We discovered a number of epistatic interactions of QTLs that influenced the activity traits in the mice, the majority of which were not previously found and appeared to affect the activity traits (especially distance and speed) primarily in the early or in the late age intervals. The overall impact of epistasis was considerable, its contribution to the total phenotypic variance varying from an average of 22-35% in the three traits across all age intervals. It was concluded that epistasis is more important than single-locus effects of genes on activity traits at specific ages and it is therefore an essential component of the genetic architecture of physical activity.",CHHS,Kinesiology,2011.0

Methods: We conducted a population-based, cross-sectional analysis of 887 women aged 20-49 who participated in the 2003-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Serum micronutrient levels were collected during the health examinations, and information on uterine fibroids was assessed on self-reported questionnaires. Multivariate logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) while controlling for confounders. Results: A statistically significant dose-response relationship was observed between vitamin A and uterine fibroids, after adjustment for age, race, education, body mass index (BMI), and oral contraceptive (OC) use (middle vs. low: OR 2.43, 95% CI 1.35-4.37; high vs. low: OR 2.66, 95% CI 1.16-6.10, p for trend=0.02). After adjustment, a dose-response relationship also emerged for vitamin C, although these associations were not statistically significant. Conclusions: It is possible that certain micronutrients affect uterine fibroid development.

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of antibiotic treatment on aerobic and anaerobic microbial community diversity and abundance during exacerbations in patients with CF. Methods: Sputum was collected at the start and completion of antibiotic treatment of exacerbations and when clinically stable. Bacteria were quantified and identified following culture, and community composition was also examined using culture-independent methods. Results: Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Burkholderia cepacia complex were detected by culture in 24/26 samples at the start of treatment, 22/26 samples at completion of treatment and 11/13 stable samples. Anaerobic bacteria were detected in all start of treatment and stable samples and in 23/26 completion of treatment samples. Molecular analysis showed greater bacterial diversity within sputum samples than was detected by culture; there was reasonably good agreement between the methods for the presence or absence of aerobic bacteria such as P aeruginosa (κ=0.74) and B cepacia complex (κ=0.92), but agreement was poorer for anaerobes. Both methods showed that the composition of the bacterial community varied between patients but remained relatively stable in most individuals despite treatment. Bacterial abundance decreased transiently following treatment, with this effect more evident for aerobes (median decrease in total viable count 2.3×107 cfu/g, p=0.005) than for anaerobes (median decrease in total viable count 3×106 cfu/g, p=0.046). Conclusion: Antibiotic treatment targeted against aerobes had a minimal effect on abundance of anaerobes and community composition, with both culture and molecular detection methods required for comprehensive characterisation of the microbial community in the CF lung.

The GameChanger middleware provides programming abstractions that are specific to social exergame mechanics, elevating their description so that even non-expert programmers can create interesting social exergames that utilize mobile phones and sensing technology to integrate physical activity into gameplay. In addition, the middleware provides constructs for performing continuous assessment of physical activity during gameplay; these constructs can be used to provide feedback to the gameplayer or to collect datasets for evaluation by health researchers.

The study also examined whether reduction in posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) over time related to reports of PTG. There were 105 participants, age 6 to 17 years, who were directly exposed to the 2004 tsunami in Southeast Asia. They were interviewed 10 and 30 months after the disaster - PTSS was assessed at both time points, and PTG was assessed at 30 months. The individual's subjective reactions to the event and concurrent PTSS (30-months post-tsunami) were independently and positively related to PTG, whereas the decrease in PTSS was not related to growth. Children and youth in this study reported lower absolute levels of PTG than those in other studies. Taken in sum, findings suggest that secondary adversities may influence posttraumatic reactions and ongoing distress, which are hypothesized to play a key role in the development of PTG. In the absence of such secondary stressors, continued distress in the form of PTSS may serve to catalyze the growth process.

2-s2.0-79959946483,Article,"An emerging literature has illuminated an important link between Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and binge eating disorder (BED) within obese cohorts. However, prior work has not examined this relationship specifically in a weight loss surgery (WLS) sample or fully explored potential psychosocial factors associated with this co-occurrence. Therefore, the present investigation sought to identify socio-demographic (i.e. age, education, BMI, ethnicity, gender, age of obesity onset) and psychological (i.e. depressive symptoms, hedonic hunger/food locus of control beliefs, severity of binge eating-related cognitions) correlates of the co-occurrence of Type 2 DM and BED among bariatric surgery candidates. An archival sample of 488 patients seeking surgical treatment for clinical obesity completed a standard battery of pre-operative psychosocial measures. The presence of BED was evaluated using a semi-structured clinical interview based on the DSM-IV TR (APA, 2000) and was further corroborated by responses on the Questionnaire on Eating and Weight Patterns-Revised (QEWP-R; Spitzer, Yanovski, & Marcus, 1993). Results indicated that 8.2% of the sample was classified as having both Type 2 DM and BED concurrently. A multivariate logistic regression model revealed that in addition to other psychological (e.g., binge eating-related cognitions, hedonic hunger) and demographic variables (i.e. male gender), African American ethnicity (OR = 3.3: 1.41-7.73) was a particularly robust indicator of comorbid status.

We examined factors that may influence willingness to try the vaginal ring including: sexual and contraceptive history, genital comfort, and vaginal ring characteristics. Design: Cross sectional. Setting: Midwestern adolescent health clinics. Participants: Adolescent women (N = 200; 14-18 years; 89% African-American). Interventions/Main Outcome Measures: All participants received education about the vaginal ring and viewed pictures demonstrating insertion; they then completed a visual/audio computer-assisted self interview. The primary outcome variable, willingness to try the vaginal ring, was a single Likert-scale item. Results: Over half the participants reported knowledge of the vaginal ring with healthcare providers identified as the most important source of contraceptive information. Comfort with one's genitals, insertion and removal, using alternative methods of insertion, and knowing positive method characteristics were significantly associated with willingness to try the vaginal ring. A decreased willingness to try the vaginal ring was related to concerns of the ring getting lost inside or falling out of the vagina. Conclusions: Willingness to try the ring was associated with positive feelings about genitals (e.g., comfort with appearance, hygiene, function). Thus, to increase willingness to try the vaginal ring among adolescents, providers should make it common practice to discuss basic female reproductive anatomy, raise awareness about female genital health and address concerns about their genitals. Providers can offer alternative insertion techniques (e.g., gloves) to make use more accessible. These strategies may increase vaginal ring use among adolescents.",CHHS,Public Health,2011.0

2-s2.0-79960073149,Article,"Outbreak of the emerging infectious disease sudden oak death continues to threaten California and Oregon forests following introduction of the exotic plant pathogen Phytophthora ramorum. Identifying areas at risk and forecasting changes in forest carbon following disease outbreak requires an understanding of the geographical distribution of host populations, which is unknown. In this study, we quantify and map the population density and carbon contents of five key host species for P. ramorum in California and Oregon, including four hosts killed by the pathogen (Notholithocarpus densiflorus, Quercus agrifolia, Quercus kelloggii and Quercus chrysolepis) and the foliar host Umbellularia californica which supports high sporulation rates. We integrate multiple sources of vegetation data, assembled from sparsely distributed (regional-scale) forest inventory and analysis (FIA) plots and more densely distributed (landscape-scale) plots for monitoring sudden oak death, and develop spatial prediction models based on correlation with environmental variables and spatial dependencies in host abundance. We estimate that 1.8 billion N. densiflorus trees (68. Tg C) and 2.6 billion Quercus host trees (227. Tg C) occur across 3.9 and 17.7 million ha of their respective habitat. A total of 436 million U. californica trees (14. Tg C) occur across 4.2 million ha which frequently overlap with Quercus and N. densiflorus host populations. Combination of landscape-scale data with FIA data resulted in more accurate estimation of host populations and their carbon contents. Forests of northern California and southwest Oregon have the highest concentration of the most susceptible hosts along with climatic conditions that favor pathogen spread. This study represents the first spatially-explicit estimate of P. ramorum host populations and their carbon contents which exceed previously published estimates. Our results will inform landscape- to regional-scale models of disease dynamics and guide management decisions regarding ecosystem impacts including risk of C release following widespread tree mortality.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2011.0

The authors also tested the validities of common FTW measures using a single sample that included elder- and childcare providers. Full-time employees (e.g., staff, faculty, administrators) of a large university were surveyed; 571 useable surveys were returned. Participants included those with elder- and childcare responsibilities (n = 16), childcare but not eldercare responsibilities (n = 177), eldercare but not childcare responsibilities (n = 41), and those with neither childcare nor eldercare responsibilities (n = 330). The mean age of participants was 46 years. Elder- and childcare providers each reported time- and strain-based conflict. Childcare providers reported higher levels of FTW than did nonchildcare providers across FTW measures in this study, supporting the measures' construct validities. The authors did not find differences between eldercare providers and non-eldercare providers on three FTW measures.

2-s2.0-79960131358,Conference Paper,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is effective treatment of Parkinson disease. Because the STN is small (9 ×7 ×4 mm) and it is not well visible using conventional imaging techniques, multi-microelectrode recordings are used to ensure accurate detection of the STN borders. Commonly used discriminations which microelectrode's signal relates to the activity of the STN are signal quality and neurologist's experience dependent. The purpose of this paper is to determine the STN coordinates in a more objective way. We present analysis of the neurological signals acquired during DBS surgeries. The purpose of our method is to discover which one of the scanning microelectrodes reaches the target area guaranteeing a most successful surgery. Signals acquired from microelectrodes are first filtered. Subsequently the spikes are detected and classified. After that, new signal is reconstructed from spikes. This signal's power is then calculated by means of FFT. Finally cumulative sum of the signal's power is used to choose a proper electrode. The ultimate goal of our research is to build a decision support system for the DBS surgery. A successful strategy showing which of the recording microelectrodes should be replaced by the DBS electrode is probably the most difficult and challenging.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2011.0

While the ability of the commonly used reactive techniques to express agent specifications is roughly equivalent, the authorial burden of constructing these specifications varies. In practice, this means that identical agent behavior may be more difficult to create in some architectures than others. In this paper we introduce the notion of representational complexity that relates to the authorial burden of constructing such agents and theoretically compare the representational complexity of finite state machines, behavior trees, and subsumption architectures.

2-s2.0-79960368506,Article,"We review the research literature and summarize the major processes by which riparian vegetation influences chemical water quality in streams, as well as how these processes vary among vegetation types, and discuss how these processes respond to removal and restoration of riparian vegetation and thereby determine the timing and level of response in stream water quality. Our emphasis is on the role that riparian vegetation plays in protecting streams from nonpoint source pollutants and in improving the quality of degraded stream water. Riparian vegetation influences stream water chemistry through diverse processes including direct chemical uptake and indirect influences such as by supply of organic matter to soils and channels, modification of water movement, and stabilization of soil. Some processes are more strongly expressed under certain site conditions, such as denitrification where groundwater is shallow, and by certain kinds of vegetation, such as channel stabilization by large wood and nutrient uptake by faster-growing species. Whether stream chemistry can be managed effectively through deliberate selection and management of vegetation type, however, remains uncertain because few studies have been conducted on broad suites of processes that may include compensating or reinforcing interactions. Scant research has focused directly on the response of stream water chemistry to the loss of riparian vegetation or its restoration. Our analysis suggests that the level and time frame of a response to restoration depends strongly on the degree and time frame of vegetation loss. Legacy effects of past vegetation can continue to influence water quality for many years or decades and control the potential level and timing of water quality improvement after vegetation is restored. Through the collective action of many processes, vegetation exerts substantial influence over the well-documented effect that riparian zones have on stream water quality. However, the degree to which stream water quality can be managed through the management of riparian vegetation remains to be clarified. An understanding of the underlying processes is important for effectively using vegetation condition as an indicator of water quality protection and for accurately gauging prospects for water quality improvement through restoration of permanent vegetation.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2010.0

Catering health care to such a culturally diverse population can be difficult for health care professionals. Culture plays a complex role in the development of health and human service delivery programs. Cultural Competence has emerged as an important issue to improve quality and eradicate racial/ethical disparities in health care. The Nursing Standards of proficiency for nursing education emphasize that nurses should be able to acknowledge patients cultural practices and take cultural influences into account when providing nursing care. A major challenge facing the nursing profession is educating and assisting nurses in providing culturally relevant care.

We analyze sharing in a P2P community in this new context under three different congestion measures: delay, jitter, and packet loss. Sharing is important to study in the presence of congestion because most existing research on P2P networks views congestion in the network as a relatively insignificant criterion. However, when delivering general-purpose content, congestion and its relationship to sharing is a critical factor that influences end-user performance. This paper looks at P2P networks from this new perspective by explicitly considering the effects of congestion on user incentives for sharing.

2-s2.0-79960738432,Article,"Leukocyte motion represents an important component in the innate immune response to infection. Intravital microscopy is a powerful tool as it enables in vivo imaging of leukocyte motion. Under inflammatory conditions, leukocytes may exhibit various motion behaviors, such as flowing, rolling, and adhering. With many leukocytes moving at a wide range of speeds, collisions occur. These collisions result in abrupt changes in the motion and appearance of leukocytes. Manual analysis is tedious, error prone, time consuming, and could introduce technician-related bias. Automatic tracking is also challenging due to the noise inherent in in vivo images and abrupt changes in motion and appearance due to collision. This paper presents a method to automatically track multiple cells undergoing collisions by modeling the appearance and motion for each collision state and testing collision hypotheses of possible transitions between states. The tracking results are demonstrated using in vivo intravital microscopy image sequences. We demonstrate that 1) 71 of colliding cells are correctly tracked; (2) the improvement of the proposed method is enhanced when the duration of collision increases; and (3) given good detection results, the proposed method can correctly track 88 of colliding cells. The method minimizes the tracking failures under collisions and, therefore, allows more robust analysis in the study of leukocyte behaviors responding to inflammatory conditions.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2011.0

Physical activity is a multifactorial behavior with various factors playing a role in determining individual physical activity levels. Research using both human and animal models in the past several years has clearly indicated that genetics is associated with physical activity. Furthermore, researchers have identified several significant and suggestive genomic quantitative trait loci associated with physical activity. To date, the identities of the causal genes underlying physical activity regulation are unclear, with few strong candidate genes. The current research provides a foundation from which future confirmatory research can be launched as well as determination of the mechanisms through which the genetic factors act. The application of this knowledge could significantly augment the information available for physical activity behavior change interventions resulting in more efficient programs for those predisposed to be inactive.",CHHS,Kinesiology,2010.0
2-s2.0-79961053394,Conference Paper,"Procedural content generation design often involves configuring an array of abstract choices at each stage of the creation process. For new tools users, or for a non-specialist user, these choices are often complex and uncertain. A good interface that guides the user in their choices helps overcome this uncertainty and subsequent frustration with the process of generating procedural content. Since good user interface (UI) experiences facilitate adoption, procedural software tool developers constantly refine UI design in order to accommodate the engineering demands of procedural content generation architecture and translate them into a coherent user experience. This paper discusses Gamr7's experience in creating, testing, and refining procedural user interfaces based on our experience with redesigning the user interface for our procedural content generation software, Ürban PAD. This case study will address user expectations, architecture, and execution flow considerations as well as solutions to some of Ürban PAD's specific user interface challenges.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2011.0

While the primary economic development strategy in the region has been to rely on branch plants to create locally-owned spillovers, recent efforts have shifted to the promotion of entrepreneurship via industrial district spillover (e.g., North Carolina's Research Triangle Park). Despite these efforts, rates of entrepreneurship remain low throughout the U.S. South. This research identifies elements of the dominant regional culture which contribute to this entrepreneurial weakness in North Carolina's Research Triangle Park.

Few studies have examined these issues in the university setting and how they may potentially impact unintended pregnancy rates. This study examined data from 172 college women aged 18-36 years enrolled in the Study on Contraceptive Knowledge in Students, a cross-sectional study conducted at a large, public university. Logistic regression was used to model the association between current type of contraceptive method used (non-coital dependent vs. coital dependent) and satisfaction as well as previous type of contraceptive method used and discontinuation of that method. Nearly 80% of contracepting women currently used a non-coital dependent method. After adjustment for age, race, and location where contraception was obtained, current non-coital dependent users were significantly more likely to be satisfied with their contraceptive method compared to women using coital dependent methods (OR = 4.73, 95% CI: 1.64, 13.63). After adjustment for age, race, and history of pregnancy, women who used non-coital dependent methods of contraception were 91% less likely to have discontinued their method compared to women who used coital dependent methods (OR = 0.09, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.20).

However, no single taxonomy has been developed that adequately describes the range of sexual behaviors found within the confines of women's prisons. The ensuing analysis rectifies this deficiency by delineating a typology of the same. First, the classification system specifies the scope of sexual activities operating within female correctional environs. Next, the heuristic foundation of the typology is tentatively explored, especially in relation to advancing proactive sexual exploitation/victimization prevention initiatives that help to equip correctional officers, wardens, and administrators for work in women's prisons. Finally, several future research directions are speculatively outlined regarding convict sexuality and the treatment of sexual abuse (for victims/perpetrators) in female correctional institutions.

2-s2.0-80051926642,Article,"During the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), the San Juan Mountains of southern Colorado, USA were covered by one of the largest ice caps in North America. The deposits formed subsequent to LGM retreat provide a record of the interaction between post-LGM climate change and late Quaternary landscape evolution. In order to determine the role of post-LGM climate change in alpine landscape modification, a high resolution surficial geologic map was produced for the four primary tributaries and the main stem of the upper Conejos River watershed in the southeastern San Juan Mountains. Soil development, 14C ages, and stratigraphic relationships provide evidence for three distinct periods of hillslope, alluvial fan and/or stream terrace deposition (∼9.5-13 k.y.a., ∼1.2-2.1 ybp, and modern) in the upper Conejos River watershed. We interpret the first of these periods to be the result of paraglacial hillslope adjustment. The lack of subsequent early to mid-Holocene deposits suggests that an interval of relatively warm climate coincided with landscape stability. We attribute late-Holocene deposition to an interval of cooling that has been documented in nearby proxy records. Modern deposits in the field are limited both in extent and occurrence, and are interpreted to be the result of erosion localized outcrops of soft, volcaniclastic bedrock. In addition to post-LGM depositional units, relatively flat erosional bedrock surfaces that sit 1-100 m above the modern stream, and that are capped with glacial till, are present in all four tributaries of the field area. These are interpreted as former glacial valley bottoms. The modern streams are incised into the floors of these hanging valleys. Headward erosion presumably initiated following deglaciation and is still active today. Modern channel long profiles differ between the four tributaries. We attribute the variability of incision into these hanging valleys to differences in basin size and bedrock erodibility, with more extensive incision occurring in basins characterized by more erodible rocks (poorly welded volcaniclastics) and larger basin size. Overall we see that the post-LGM landscape evolution in this alpine environment is the result of the complex interaction of Holocene climate change acting on basins of varying size and bedrock type.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2010.0

Here, 29 Pacific Northwest watersheds illustrate how distribution of seasonal snow, transient snow, and winter rain mediates sensitivity to 20th century warming. Watersheds with >50% of their area in the seasonal snow zone had significant (α≤0.1) trends towards greater winter and lower summer discharge, while lower elevations had no consistent trends. In seasonal snow-dominated watersheds, runoff occurs 22-27 days earlier and minimum flows are 5-9% lower than in 1962, based on Sen's slope over the period. Trends in peak streamflow depend on whether watershed area susceptible to rain-on-snow events is increasing or decreasing.

In this paper, we compared the responses of breeding birds and carabid beetles to urbanization, specifically asking whether the emerging generalizations of the effects of extreme levels of urbanization on birds (declines in total species richness and the richness of specialist species, increases in total abundance and the abundances of native generalist and introduced species, and community simplification, including increasing similarity) could also be applied to ground beetles. We also directly tested for congruence between birds and ground beetles using correlations between variables describing bird and beetle community structure and correlations between bird and beetle distance matrices describing community dissimilarity between pairs of sampling locations. Breeding bird and carabid beetle community data were collected in Ottawa, Ontario, and Gatineau, Quebec, Canada, in two groups of sites: developed sites representing the predictor variable within-site housing density, and forested sites adjacent to development representing the predictor variable neighboring housing density (each site was 0.25 km 2). Breeding birds and carabid beetles do not respond similarly to increasing within-site housing density but do exhibit some similar responses to increasing neighboring housing density. Birds displayed strong declines in diversity, compositional changes, and community simplification in response to increasing within-site housing density. Forest and introduced species of birds and beetles responded similarly to increasing housing density within a site, but responses of overall diversity and open-habitat species richness and patterns of community simplification differed between birds and beetles. Increasing neighboring housing density resulted in increases in the abundances of introduced birds and introduced beetles and similar patterns of community simplification in both taxa. To better understand and mitigate the effects of urbanization on biodiversity, we suggest that, in addition to the responses of birds, future research should focus on the responses of other taxa in the urban matrix.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2011.0

To evaluate whether and, if so, under what conditions this degradation may occur, we integrate evidence from multiple sub-disciplines of psychology. The temporal stability of construct validity is considered in light of the evidence regarding the differential stability of g and the invariance of measurement properties of GMA tests over the adult life-span. The temporal stability of criterion-related validity is considered in light of evidence from long-term predictive validity studies in educational and occupational realms. The evidence gained from this broad-ranging review suggests that temporal degradation of the construct- and criterion-related validity of ability test scores may not be as ubiquitous as some have previously concluded. Rather, it appears that both construct and criterion-related validity coefficients are reasonably robust over time and that any apparent degradation of criterion-related validity coefficients has more to do with changes in the determinants of task performance and changes in the nature of the criterion domain rather temporal degradation per se (i.e., the age of the test scores). A key exception to the conclusion that temporal validity degradation is more myth than reality concerns decision validity. Although the evidence is sparse, it is likely that the utility of a given GMA test score for making diagnostic decisions about an individual deteriorates over time.

Methods: Using data obtained from a country-wide health survey of 2310 households involving female and male respondents aged 18 and over, we investigated the response pattern to the CES-D items, the factor structure, internal consistency, inter-item correlations of the total scale and its negatively and positively formulated subscales. We used logistic regression analysis to relate the constructs measured by the CES-D and its subscales to known determinants of depression. Results: Armenian respondents of both genders significantly suppressed their positive emotions, thus over-endorsing positively formulated (reverse-coded) items, therefore producing artificially high depression scores. Factor analysis of the scale yielded a three-factor structure (combined Depressed/Somatic, Positive Affect, and Interpersonal). The Positive Affect factor correlated weakly with the other two factors, and its inclusion reduced the internal consistency of the whole scale. Unlike the 16-item subscale of negatively formulated items, Positive Affect was not related to several known determinants of depression and did not reflect known depression-specific differences between genders. The set of determinants of Positive Affect included mainly lifestyle and attitudinal variables. Limitations: This study did not assess the concurrent and discriminate validity of the Armenian CES-D. Conclusions: For Armenians, the construct measured by the four Positive Affect items of CES-D is not related to depressive symptoms as measured by the other items.

However, training the classifiers in a high-dimensional multi-modal feature space requires a large number of labeled training images, which will further result in the problem of curse of dimensionality. To tackle this problem, a hierarchical feature subset selection algorithm is proposed to enable more accurate image classification, where the processes for feature selection and classifier training are seamlessly integrated in a single framework. First, a feature hierarchy (i.e., concept tree for automatic feature space partition and organization) is used to automatically partition high-dimensional heterogeneous multi-modal visual features into multiple low-dimensional homogeneous single-modal feature subsets according to their certain physical meanings and each of them is used to characterize one certain type of the diverse visual properties of the images. Second, principal component analysis (PCA) is performed on each homogeneous singlemodal feature subset to select the most representative feature dimensions and a weak classifier is learned simultaneously. After the weak classifiers and their representative feature dimensions are available for all these homogeneous single-modal feature subsets, they are combined to generate an ensemble image classifier and achieve hierarchical feature subset selection.

This study assessed the prevalence of selfcare activities among African Americans with high blood pressure and examined differences between adherers and nonadherers to self-care activities. Methods: Interviews were conducted with 186 African Americans. Self-care activities were measured using the H-SCALE (Hypertension Self-Care Activity Level Effects), which was developed to assess the behavioral activities recommended for optimal management of high blood pressure. Results: More than half of participants reported adhering to medication recommendations and prescribed physical activity levels (58.6% and 52.2%, respectively). Following practices related to weight management was less frequent, (30.1%) and adherence to low-salt diet recommendations was also low (22.0%). Three-fourths were nonsmokers and 65% abstained from alcohol. Across the self-care activities, adherers were more likely to be older and female. Nonadherers were more likely to be uninsured. Conclusions: Many African Americans still face challenges related to hypertension self-care, particularly with weight management and salt reduction.

Dealing with this attack is challenging since the unreliable wireless communication feature and resource constraints of the sensor network may cause communication failure and mislead to the incorrect decision about the presence of such attack. In this paper, we propose a data provenance based mechanism to detect the attack and identify the source of attack i.e. the malicious node. For this purpose, we utilize the characteristics of the watermarking based secure provenance transmission mechanism that we proposed earlier and rely on the inter-packet timing characteristics after the provenance embedding. The scheme consists of three phases (i) Packet Loss Detection (ii) Identification of Attack Presence (iii) Localizing the Malicious Node/Link. The packet loss is detected based on the distribution of the inter-packet delays. The presence of the attack is determined by comparing the empricial average packet loss rate with the natural packet loss rate of the data flow path. To isolate the malicious link, we transmit more provenance information along with the sensor data.

We introduce iLayer - an Application Access Control Framework for Content Management Systems. iLayer is a least privilege based model that protects content management systems from third party developed applications. iLayer makes policy recommendations to CMS administrators for third party applications. These policies are reviewed and set by the CMS administrator and enforced by the iLayer Framework. To verify the feasibility of our approach, we implemented a prototype of our framework on a popular open source content management system.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2011.0
2-s2.0-80052427226,Article,"Objective: To assess expectations for recovery and use of behavior change strategies as predictors of subsequent diet and physical activity among adults recently hospitalized for a cardiac event. Design: Quasi-experimental design in which adults with recent cardiac event-related hospitalization completed surveys assessing health behaviors and attitudes immediately post-discharge and three months later. Results: Among those completing the study (n = 323), positive expectations about recovery and more frequent use of behavior change skills predicted greater physical activity and better nutrition at follow-up. In multivariate models, baseline health behavior was a significant predictor of physical activity and fruit and vegetable intake at follow-up (alpha = 0.05). Conclusions: Individuals participating in physical activity and eating a heart-healthy diet approximately three months after cardiac hospitalization possessed behavior change skills. Early intervention is critical as health behaviors occurring just days after hospitalization predicted future health behavior.",CHHS,Public Health,2011.0
2-s2.0-80052474171,Article,"Background: Until recently, no Japanese versions have existed of the more popular, patient-reported disability questionnaires for neck pain. This study aimed to test the reliability, validity, and responsiveness of the Japanese version of the Neck Pain and Disability Scale (NPDS), one of the most widely used questionnaires in patients with neck pain. Methods: In this validation study, 167 outpatients with neck pain participated. Patients received the NPDS and the Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36-item Health Survey (SF-36), and used Visual Analog Scales (VASs) to assess pain and global health. To examine test-retest reliability, patients who were considered stable by clinicians were given the NPDS 2 weeks after baseline. To examine responsiveness, patients who had not undergone treatment at the time of the first data collection or had no change in treatment over 3 months were studied again 2 weeks after starting a new medication or physical therapy. Results: Of the 167 participants, 143 completed the questionnaires (85.6%). Factor analysis showed two factors, defined as neck-pain-related disability (factor 1) and neck-related pain (factor 2). Cronbach's α coefficient for factor 1, factor 2, and total score was 0.94, 0.93, and 0.96. The intra-class correlation coefficients for the 19 more stable patients were 0.79, 0.88, and 0.87. For concurrent validity, the correlation between NPDS subscales and total score and SF-36 subscale scores ranged from r = -0.54 to -0.22 (p < 0.01). Correlations between the NPDS subscales and total score and VAS of pain ranged from 0.56 to 0.77 (p < 0.01) and those for VAS of global health ranged from 0.48 to 0.63 (p < 0.01). The NPDS subscales and total scores of the 41 patients retested after treatment were significantly improved. Conclusions: The Japanese version of the NPDS is a useful scale with reliability, validity, and responsiveness in assessing patients suffering from neck pain.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Psychology,2011.0

Using an experimental design with random assignment to groups, program impact on participating parents' knowledge, behavior, and attitudes compared to those of a comparison group of parents receiving standard community-based support services was examined. As hypothesized, the ACT Parents Raising Safe Kids program achieved positive results in several areas related to effective parenting, including a reduction in the use of harsh verbal and physical discipline and an increase in nurturing behavior. Positive results were observable both at the conclusion of the ACT program and at three-month follow-up. Results further indicated a positive impact on parent expectations and social support for those parents with the greatest need in these areas. Qualitative data collected through focus groups demonstrated that parents themselves perceived numerous benefits to the ACT program, including assistance in controlling their anger, learning and implementing better parenting and discipline strategies, and recognizing when their child's behavior is developmentally appropriate. Overall, findings suggest that the ACT Parents Raising Safe Kids program is a promising primary prevention strategy that can be implemented across diverse community settings.",Education,Educational Leadership,2011.0

The purpose of this study was to monitor URTI symptoms and severity in a heterogeneous group of community adults and contrast across tertiles of physical activity and fitness levels while adjusting for potential confounders. Design: A group of 1002 adults (ages 18-85 years, 60% female, 40% male) were followed for 12 weeks during the winter and fall seasons while monitoring URTI symptoms and severity using the Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey. Subjects reported frequency of aerobic activity, and rated their physical fitness level using a 10-point Likert scale. A general linear model, with adjustment for seven confounders, was used to examine the effect of exercise frequency and fitness level on the number of days with URTI and severity of symptoms. Results: The number of days with URTI during the 12-week period was significantly reduced, 43% in subjects reporting ≥5 days/week aerobic exercise compared to those who were largely sedentary (≤1 day/week) and 46% when comparing subjects in the high versus low fitness tertile. URTI severity and symptomatology were also reduced 32% to 41% between high and low aerobic activity and physical fitness tertiles. Conclusions: Perceived physical fitness and frequency of aerobic exercise are important correlates of reduced days with URTI and severity of symptoms during the winter and fall common cold seasons.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2011.0
2-s2.0-80052638739,Article,"Network security depends on a number of factors. And a common characteristic of these factors is that they are dynamic in nature. Such factors include new vulnerabilities and threats, the network policy structure and traffic. These factors can be divided into two broad categories. Network risk and service risk. As the name implies, the former one corresponds to risk associated with the network policy whereas the later one depends on the services and software running on the system. Therefore, evaluating security from both the service and policy perspective can allow the management system to make decisions regarding how a system should be changed to enhance security as par the management objective. Such decision making includes choosing between alternative security architectures, designing security countermeasures, and to systematically modify security configurations to improve security. As there may be real time changes to the network threat, this evaluation must be done dynamically to handle such changes. In this paper, we provide a security metric framework that quantifies objectively the most significant security risk factors, which include existing vulnerabilities, historical trend of vulnerabilities of the remotely accessible services, prediction of potential vulnerabilities for these services and their estimated severity, unused address space and finally propagation of an attack within the network. These factors cover both the service aspect and the network aspect of risk toward a system. We have implemented this framework as a user-friendly tool called Risk based prOactive seCurity cOnfiguration maNAger (ROCONA) and showed how this tool simplifies security configuration management of services and policies in a system using risk measurement and mitigation. We also combine all the components into one single metric and present validation experiments using real-life vulnerability data from National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and show comparison with two existing risk measurement tools.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2011.0
2-s2.0-80052658486,Article,"Routing in wireless networks has been heavily studied in the last decade. Many routing protocols are based on classic shortest path algorithms. However, shortest path-based routing protocols suffer from uneven load distribution in the network, such as crowed center effect where the center nodes have more load than the nodes in the periphery. Aiming to balance the load, we propose a novel routing method, called Circular Sailing Routing (CSR), which can distribute the traffic more evenly in the network. The proposed method first maps the network onto a sphere via a simple stereographic projection, and then the route decision is made by a newly defined ""circular distance"" on the sphere instead of the Euclidean distance in the plane. We theoretically prove that for a network, the distance traveled by the packets using CSR is no more than a small constant factor of the minimum (the distance of the shortest path). We also extend CSR to a localized version, Localized CSR, by modifying greedy routing without any additional communication overhead. In addition, we investigate how to design CSR routing for 3D networks. For all proposed methods, we conduct extensive simulations to study their performances and compare them with global shortest path routing or greedy routing in 2D and 3D wireless networks.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2010.0

2-s2.0-80052672041,Article,"Altruism is hard to explain because altruistic acts are costly to the individuals who perform them. Although past work has identified conditions under which altruism can evolve, there is wide agreement among evolutionary theorists in the social sciences and biology that indiscriminate altruism cannot evolve in a large randomly matching population. Building on earlier work (Mark, 2002), I show that cultural transmission can create a cultural evolutionary force toward indiscriminate altruism in a large randomly matching population. The cultural transmission of a behavior (altruistic or selfish) disproportionately exposes those who acquire that behavior to that behavior prior to its acquisition. That is, individuals who have acquired an altruistic behavior through cultural transmission (i.e., who learned to behave altruistically from other people) were disproportionately exposed to the altruistic acts of others. Likewise, individuals who have acquired a selfish behavior through cultural transmission were disproportionately exposed to the selfish acts of others. Because of this disproportionate prior exposure, altruists have disproportionately benefitted from the altruistic acts of others, and selfish individuals have disproportionately been hurt by the selfish acts of others. If the benefits of being the target of altruistic acts increase one's attractiveness as a behavioral model, then a cultural evolutionary force toward altruism results.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Sociology,2011.0

This in turn increases the potential of security breaches due to rule conflicts, requirement violations or lack of security hardening. Most of the existing tools are either limited in scope as they do not offer a global analysis of different network devices or hard to comprehensively use because these tools are not declarative. Declarative logic programming can readily express network configurations and security requirements for verification analysis. In this paper, we use Prolog to model the entire network security configurations including topology, routing, firewall and IPSec.

J Strength Cond Res 25(8): 2075-2083, 2011-There is limited information regarding the physiological and psychological demands of the racing environment, and the subsequent effect on the performance of pit crew athletes. The purpose of this study was to evaluate heart rates (HRs) and core body temperatures (CTs) of pit crew athletes in the race environment. The HR and CT of pit crew athletes (n = 7) and control subjects were measured during 6 National Association for Stock Car Automobile Racing Sprint Cup races using ingestible sensors (HQ Inc, Palmetto, FL, USA). The HR and CT were measured before each race, at 15-minute intervals during the race, and upon completion of each pit stop. Compared to the control subject at each race, the pit crew athletes had significantly (p = 0.014) lower core temperatures (CTs). The pit crew athletes displayed higher HRs on the asphalt tracks than on concrete tracks (p = 0.011), and HR responses of the crew members were significantly (p = 0.012) different between pit crew positions, with the tire changers and jackman exhibiting higher HRs than the tire carriers. Unexpectedly, the CTs of the pit crew athletes were not elevated in the race environment, despite high ambient temperatures and the extensive fire-protection equipment (e.g., helmet, suit, gloves) each pit crew athlete wore. The lack of CT change is possibly the result of the increased HR more efficiently shunting blood to the skin and dissipating heat as a consequence of the athletes' extensive training regimen and ensuing heat acclimation. Additionally, it is possible that psychological stress unique to several of the tracks provided an additive effect resulting in increased heart rates.",CHHS,Kinesiology,2011.0

Two experiments compared participants' pain ratings to high and low levels of electrical stimulation while engaging in interactive gaming with an HMD. In the first, gaming with the HMD was compared to a positive emotion induction condition; and in the second experiment the HMD was compared to a condition in which the game was projected onto a wall. Interactive gaming significantly reduced numerical ratings of painful stimuli when compared to the baseline and affect condition. However, when the two gaming conditions were directly compared, they equally reduced participants' pain ratings.

This assumption should be closely examined due to the emerging evidence of fewer, more global therapeutic factors. The present study was conducted to continue the development of the Therapeutic Factors Inventory-Short Form (TFI-S) and focused on confirming its factor structure and evaluating aspects of its concurrent, discriminant, and predictive validity. A sample comprising a total of 435 clients from 52 distinct therapy groups at eight different clinical sites in the U.S. and Canada was obtained. Structural equation modeling analyses indicated that a four-factor model had a reasonably good fit to the TFI-S rating data, and it provided indications for further refinement of the constituent items. The analyses resulted in a revised, 19-item measure, the Therapeutic Factors Inventory-19 (TFI-19). Three-level HLM analyses demonstrated that the four factors were sensitive to change in member perceptions over time. Significant and meaningful relationships between the TFI-19 factors and subscales of the Group Climate Questionnaire-Short Form provided support for the concurrent validity of the TFI-19. Two-level HLM analyses identified significant relationships between the TFI-19 factors and posttreatment status on symptomatic and interpersonal distress, thereby supporting the predictive validity of the TFI-19.

This article describes these complaints, considers facility-level predictors of complaints, and examines how complaints to the 2 entities are related. Design and Methods: This article uses North Carolina complaint data from the state certification agency and Ombudsman from 2002 to 2006. First, we outline the similarities and differences in the 2 complaint sources by considering descriptive statistics and examining the structure of the 2 agencies. Second, we examine the relationship between complaints and facility characteristics that have been predictive of traditional quality measures. Finally, we examine the relationships between the 2 types of complaints. Results: We find that complaints to the 2 agencies exhibit distinct differences in substantiation rates, although the top complaint category for both agencies is quality of care. Having a higher proportion of Medicaid residents is generally not predictive of complaint volume, whereas having a higher proportion of Medicare residents is associated with higher complaint levels. Implications: We find a lack of association between complaints to the 2 agencies when examining specific matched categories of complaints in many cases, suggesting that the 2 entities are not duplicating efforts in these categories.",Business,Economics,2011.0

Our findings suggest that PSM may play a more important role in person-job fit than person-organization fit. Consistent across three sectors of employment, individuals with stronger PSM were more likely to accept jobs that emphasize service to others - whether that be pro bono work (private sector), client interaction (public sector), or client representation (nonprofit sector). After controlling for characteristics that influence person-job fit, PSM neither increased the likelihood that individuals would accept a public sector job nor decreased the likelihood that they would accept a private sector job. Among other things, our findings suggest that sector may be an inaccurate proxy for values that are often taken for granted in PSM studies. The Author 2011.

Design/methodology/approach: A survey was conducted at two internal medicine primary care clinics affiliated with a major university health system. A latent class analysis was used to detect patient subpopulations based on profiles of response for five satisfaction-with-staff indicators. Findings: The response rate was 86.46 percent (479 of 554). Analyses revealed four patient subpopulation segments. Segment I (n=241) patients uniformly indicated a high level of satisfaction across the five satisfaction-with-staff indicators. These patients tended to be older and less educated, and have lower incomes relative to patients in other segments. Patients in Segment II (n=83) expressed satisfaction with staff caring and need accommodation, but dissatisfaction with access to their physicians. Patients in Segment III (n=51) indicated high levels of satisfaction with access and low levels of satisfaction with staff caring and need accommodation. Segment IV (n=104) patients uniformly expressed low levels of satisfaction across all indicators and generally were younger and more educated, as well as had higher incomes than other patients. Originality/value: Patients have different expectations from their non-physician staff, e.g. younger, more affluent, and educated patients expressed dissatisfaction with staff. This suggests that non-physician staff should provide extra/further responsiveness to have these patients' needs met.

The ANPS was conceptualized as a potential clinical research tool, which would help experimentalists and clinicians situate subjects and clients in primary-process affective space. These emotion systems are reviewed in the context of a multi-tiered framing of consciousness spanning from primary affect, which encodes biological valences, to higher level tertiary (thought mediated) processing.

Although advances in pharmacology and environmental science have provided many opportunities to improve asthma control, asthma remains a major cause of missed school days, acute care visits, and hospitalizations. Patient education is a key component of asthma care. The National Asthma Educator Certification Board was established in February 2000 and charged with the mission of ""promoting optimal asthma management and quality of life for individuals with asthma, their families and communities by advancing excellence in asthma education through the certified asthma educator process."" This study was performed to describe the workforce of certified asthma educators (AE-Cs®) by surveying a sample of educators who completed the recertification process. AE-Cs® who had completed the recertification process were invited to participate in an anonymous online survey. Sixty five of 135 (48%) recertificants completed the survey. The primary training of respondents was in respiratory therapy (51.6%) and nursing (42.2%). Respondents were primarily female (92.3%) and Caucasian (95.4%). The majority worked in specialty care outpatient (59.3%) or hospital inpatient (40.7%) settings. Twenty percent reported an increase in job responsibilities as a result of achieving their initial certification as an AE-C®. Most AE-Cs® have their basic training in either respiratory therapy or nursing. The workforce of AE-Cs® does not reflect the racial or ethnic percentages seen in the asthma population in the United States. More educators are needed to serve the growing numbers of individuals with asthma. Achievement of certification as an AE-C® resulted in additional job responsibilities in 20% of survey respondents.",CHHS,Public Health,2011.0

However, the factors important for RFID's adoption in supply chains have not been well understood. Many organizations are reluctant to participate in supply-chain level RFID projects because of this lack of understanding. Drawing on innovation diffusion theory and technology-organization-environment framework, we developed a conceptual model for RFID adoption in supply chains. Survey data were collected worldwide and included different players in supply chains, such as manufacturers, transporters, wholesalers, and retailers. Our analysis based on logistic regression demonstrated that technology complexity, technology maturity, top management support, trading partner power, and trading partner readiness were significant predictors for RFID adoption in supply chain activities. This study is the first empirical study to test and validate technology maturity as an important factor for technology adoption. We conclude the article by discussing the theoretical and practical implications of our research findings.",Business,BISOM,2011.0
2-s2.0-80053529157,Article,"Liver fibrosis is the excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components that disrupt normal liver microcirculation and lead to organ injury. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), following transdifferentiation, are the central mediators of hepatic fibrosis through increased secretion of ECM components, including type I collagen. The mechanism(s) by which the antioxidant S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe) acts to modulate type I collagen secretion in activated HSCs was examined. Hepatic stellate cells were culture-activated for 13-15 days and treated with SAMe. Type I collagen, proteasomal activity and resident endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein [78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (Grp78) and protein disulphide isomerase (PDI)] expression were measured. Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activity, and its role in SAMe-mediated collagen inhibition, was determined. Type I collagen polyubiquitination was examined. S-adenosyl-L-methionine significantly inhibited type I collagen secretion without significant changes in type I collagen mRNA expression. SAMe also increased NF-κB activity, and blocking NF-κB activity using a dominant-negative IκBα abolished the SAMe-mediated type I collagen secretion. Examination of the post-transcriptional fate of procollagen demonstrated that SAMe treatment led to intracellular type I collagen polyubiquitination accompanied by diminution of proteasomal activity. Expression of Grp78 and PDI (resident ER proteins) were significantly decreased by SAMe treatment. S-adenosyl-L-methionine inhibits collagen processing leading to increased ubiquitination and decreased secretion. These findings represent a novel mechanism for modulating type I collagen expression in activated HSCs.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2011.0
2-s2.0-80053537536,Article,"Previous research on security of network coding focused on the protection of data dissemination procedures and the detection of malicious activities such as pollution attacks. The capabilities of network coding to detect other attacks have not been fully explored. In this paper, we propose a new mechanism based on physical layer network coding to detect wormhole attacks. When two signal sequences collide at the receiver, the starting point of the collision is determined by the distances between the receiver and the senders. Therefore, by comparing the starting points of the collisions at two receivers, we can estimate the distance between them and detect fake neighbor connections via wormholes. While the basic idea is clear, we have proposed several schemes at both physical and network layers to transform the idea into a practical approach. Simulations using BPSK modulation at the physical layer show that the wireless nodes can effectively detect fake neighbor connections without the adoption of special hardware or time synchronization.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2011.0

This bottom-up simulation, however, has been identified as both data-and computing-intensive. While cyberinfrastrucutre provides such support for intensive computation, the appropriate management and use of cyberinfrastructure (CI)-enabled computing resources for ABM raise a challenging and intriguing issue. To gain insight into this issue, in this article we present a service-oriented simulation framework that supports spatially explicit agent-based modeling within a CI environment. This framework is designed at three levels: intermodel, intrasimulation, and individual. Functionalities at these levels are encapsulated into services, each of which is an assembly of new or existing services. Services at the intermodel and intrasimulation levels are suitable for generic ABM; individual-level services are designed specifically for modeling intelligent agents. The service-oriented simulation framework enables the integration of domain-specific functionalities for ABM and allows access to high-performance and distributed computing resources to perform simulation tasks that are often computationally intensive. We used a case study to investigate the utility of the framework in enabling agent-based modeling within a CI environment. We conducted experiments using supercomputing resources on the TeraGrid - a key element of the US CI. It is indicated that the service-oriented framework facilitates the leverage of CI-enabled resources for computationally intensive agent-based modeling.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2011.0

2-s2.0-80053606393,Article,"Background: Local public health departments (LHDs) in the United States have been encouraged to collaborate with various other community organizations and individuals. Current research suggests that many forms of active partnering are ongoing, and there are numerous examples of LHD collaboration with a specific organization for a specific purpose or program. However, no existing research has attempted to characterize collaboration, for the defined purpose of setting community health status priorities, between a defined population of local officials and a defined group of alternative partnering organizations. The specific aims of this study were to 1) determine the range of collaborative involvement exhibited by a study population of local public health officials, and, 2) characterize the patterns of the selection of organizations/individuals involved with LHDs in the process of setting community health status priorities. Methods. Local health department officials in North Carolina (n = 53) responded to an exploratory survey about their levels of involvement with eight types of possible collaborator organizations and individuals. Descriptive statistics and the stochastic clustering technique of Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) were used to characterize their collaboration. Results: Local health officials vary extensively in their level of collaboration with external collaborators. While the range of total involvement varies, the patterns of involvement for this specific function are relatively uniform. That is, regardless of the total level of involvement (low, medium or high), officials maintain similar hierarchical preference rankings with Community Advisory Boards and Local Boards of Health most involved and Experts and Elected Officials least involved. Conclusion: The extent and patterns of collaboration among LHDs with other community stakeholders for a specific function can be described and ultimately related to outcome measures of LHD performance.",CHHS,Public Health,2011.0
2-s2.0-80053632774,Article,"The spread of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) in natural environments poses substantial risks to biodiversity and ecosystem function. As EIDs and their impacts grow, landscape- to regional-scale models of disease dynamics are increasingly needed for quantitative prediction of epidemic outcomes and design of practicable strategies for control. Here we use spatio-temporal, stochastic epidemiological modeling in combination with realistic geographical modeling to predict the spread of the sudden oak death pathogen (Phytophthora ramorum) through heterogeneous host populations in wildland forests, subject to fluctuating weather conditions. The model considers three stochastic processes: (1) the production of inoculum at a given site; (2) the chance that inoculum is dispersed within and among sites; and (3) the probability of infection following transmission to susceptible host vegetation. We parameterized the model using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation from snapshots of local- and regional-scale data on disease spread, taking account of landscape heterogeneity and the principal scales of spread. Our application of the model to Californian landscapes over a 40-year period (1990-2030), since the approximate time of pathogen introduction, revealed key parameters driving the spatial spread of disease and the magnitude of stochastic variability in epidemic outcomes. Results show that most disease spread occurs via local dispersal (<250 m) but infrequent long-distance dispersal events can substantially accelerate epidemic spread in regions with high host availability and suitable weather conditions. In the absence of extensive control, we predict a ten-fold increase in disease spread between 2010 and 2030 with most infection concentrated along the north coast between San Francisco and Oregon. Long-range dispersal of inoculum to susceptible host communities in the Sierra Nevada foothills and coastal southern California leads to little secondary infection due to lower host availability and less suitable weather conditions. However, a shift to wetter and milder conditions in future years would double the amount of disease spread in California through 2030. This research illustrates how stochastic epidemiological models can be applied to realistic geographies and used to increase predictive understanding of disease dynamics in large, heterogeneous regions.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2011.0

We used a landscape epidemiological approach to examine two scenarios regarding diversity effects on the emerging plant pathogen Phytophthora ramorum across a broad, heterogeneous ecoregion: (1) an amplification effect exists where disease risk is greater in areas with higher plant diversity due to the pathogen's wide host range, or (2) a dilution effect where risk is reduced with increasing diversity due to lower competency of alternative hosts. We found evidence for pathogen dilution, whereby disease risk was lower in sites with higher species diversity, after accounting for potentially confounding effects of host density and landscape heterogeneity. Our results suggest that although nearly all plants in the ecosystem are hosts, alternative hosts may dilute disease transmission by competent hosts, thereby buffering forest health from infectious disease.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2011.0

The efficiency, responsiveness, and service lifetime of the mobile actuators depend on the allocation of the workload to each individual actuator. Starting from an initial deployment, the proposed distributed multi-actuator control algorithm computes the load in each partition and uses the load imbalance as a virtual force to dynamically move the actuators until a balanced distribution is achieved. The load in each partition for an individual actuator includes both the total travel cost to visit or contact all sensors in the partition and the cost of servicing them. Finding the minimum workload allocation to serve each partition is an NP-hard problem. Therefore, efficient heuristics are proposed to do the partition, plan the path of each actuator and calculate its workload.

A geometrical simulation using the framework rigidity optimized dynamics algorithm (FRODA) based on rigid cluster decomposition is compared to the commonly employed elastic network model (specifically the Anisotropic Network Model ANM) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The essential dynamics are quantified by a mode subspace constructed from ANM and a principal component analysis (PCA) on FRODA and MD trajectories. Aggregate conformational ensembles are constructed to provide a basis for quantitative comparisons between FRODA runs using different parameter settings to critically assess how the predictions of essential dynamics depend on a priori arbitrary user-defined distance constraint rules. We established a range of physicality for these parameters. Surprisingly, FRODA maintains greater intra-consistent results than obtained from MD trajectories, comparable to ANM. Additionally, a mode subspace is constructed from PCA on an exemplar set of myoglobin structures from the Protein Data Bank. Significant overlap across the three model subspaces and the experimentally derived subspace is found. While FRODA provides the most robust sampling and characterization of the native basin, all three models give similar dynamical information of a native state, further demonstrating that structure is the key determinant of dynamics.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2011.0

Our approach concentrates on assisting users to analyze statistical network topology patterns that could expose significant attack features. Specifically, we investigate Sybil attacks that have severe impacts on the fundamental operations of wireless networks. We have analyzed the features of network topologies under various Sybil attacks and, consequently, designed several matrix reordering algorithms to generate statistical patterns. These topology patterns are automatically evaluated and classified through the measured structural similarities to the signature attack patterns.

Most malicious botnets have the ability to be rented out to a broad range of potential customers, allowing each customer to launch different attacks from the other. Consequently, under the control of multiple botmasters, various attacks and transactions at different times attempt to damage networked infrastructures.

Yet the majority of the TF-DNA complexes remain unsolved despite the considerable experimental efforts being made. Computational docking represents a promising alternative to bridge the gap. To facilitate the study of TF-DNA docking, carefully designed benchmarks are needed for performance evaluation and identification of the strengths and weaknesses of docking algorithms. Results: We constructed two benchmarks for flexible and rigid TF-DNA docking respectively using a unified non-redundant set of 38 test cases. The test cases encompass diverse fold families and are classified into easy and hard groups with respect to the degrees of difficulty in TF-DNA docking. The major parameters used to classify expected docking difficulty in flexible docking are the conformational differences between bound and unbound TFs and the interaction strength between TFs and DNA. For rigid docking in which the starting structure is a bound TF conformation, only interaction strength is considered.

2-s2.0-80655144859,"General Publications (Press, Editorials, Letters)","Cleft care is generally characterized by staged, carefully timed surgeries and long-term, team-centered follow-up. Acute and chronic crises can wreak havoc on the comprehensive team care required by children with craniofacial anomalies. In addition, there is evidence that crises, including natural disasters and chronic disruptions, such as political turmoil and poverty, can lead to an increased incidence of craniofacial anomalies. The purpose of this article is to delineate the impact of acute and chronic crises on cleft care. Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, Louisiana, in 2005, resulted in an acute crisis that temporarily disrupted the infrastructure necessary to deliver cleft care; chronic turmoil in the West Bank/Palestine has resulted in an absence of infrastructure to deliver cleft care. Through these central examples, this article will illustrate - through the prism of cleft care - the need for (1) disaster preparedness for acute crises, (2) changing needs following acute crises that may lead to persistent chronic disruption, and (3) baseline and long-term monitoring of population changes after a disaster has disrupted a health care delivery system.",CHHS,Public Health,2011.0
2-s2.0-80655149516,Article,"Objective: To examine social issues in the conduct of cleft and craniofacial care through relief programs in disrupted crisis contexts. Method: Social, health policy, and ethical analyses. Results: At best, craniofacial team care is multidisciplinary, coordinated, and sustained, requiring a long-term relationship between team members, patients, and families. Disasters and societal turmoil interrupt such relationships, causing craniofacial care to become a secondary concern. Providing craniofacial team care in a crisis setting requires rebuilding disrupted coordination and communication. Crisis relief care involves a complex set of expectations and responsibilities and raises issues such as (1) quality assurance, infection control, appropriate standards of care, and follow-up care/continuity; (2) equity of access to services and clinical ethics in the context of war and/or deprivation; (3) training of visitors in the local nation or site; (4) disciplinary composition of teams, interprofessional communication/ rivalry, and credentials of clinicians; (5) ownership of the site and local visitor relations; (6) fundraising and marketing strategies; and (7) ethical issues in the doctor-patient relationship. Conclusions: Specific ethical standards for international cleft and craniofacial care delivery also apply to domestic and global crisis relief contexts. Guidance on issues related to professional experience, informed consent, and continuity of care will help care providers address social and ethical issues raised in crisis relief programs. This paper proposes that the Position Paper of the American Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Association (ACPA) on International Treatment Programs should be used as a template to develop and disseminate a set of standards that apply to crisis relief.",CHHS,Public Health,2011.0

In this paper, I argue that institutionalization is key to understanding whether dictators respond to domestic opposition groups with concessions. I present a nominal typology of dictatorial opposition movements, arguing that the manner in which the opposition is incorporated into the regime reveals important information about the types of concessions dictators will likely provide. Using a system of endogenous equations, I show that dictators buy off some types of domestic opposition with material concessions and liberalize when they face other types of opposition. Because dictators often make decisions facing environmental constraints, however, I also argue that financial conditions can limit a dictator's ability to respond beneficently to the opposition.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Political Science and Public Administration,2011.0
2-s2.0-80755168304,Conference Paper,"In this paper, we have addressed two key issues for leveraging large-scale loosely-tagged images for object classifier training: (a) loose object tags, e.g., multiple object tags are loosely given at the image level without identifying object locations in the images; (b) missing object tags, e.g., some object tags are missed and thus negative bags may contain positive instances. To address both the issues of loose object tags and missing object tags jointly, a novel multiple instance learning (MIL) algorithm is developed and it consists of the following key components: (1) An agreement value is defined for characterizing instance-tag relatedness; (2) Automatic instance clustering is performed and inter-cluster correlations are leveraged for agreement value refinement; (3) An automatic instance-tag alignment algorithm is developed for assigning multiple object tags into the most relevant image instances with maximum agreement values and determining uncertain image instances whose object tags are not available on the tag list (missing object tags); (4) Object co-occurrence contexts are leveraged to predict missing object tags for the uncertain image instances.

Methods: We analyzed data from the 2007-2008 National Survey of Primary Care Physician Practices Regarding Prostate Cancer Screening (N=1,256), the most recent and comprehensive survey specifically designed to address issues concerning prostate cancer screening and representing nearly 95,000 PCPs. We evaluated the relationship between PCP behavior regarding prostate cancer screening discussions and covariates, including PCP demographic and practice-related factors. Weighted percentages and Chi-square tests were used to compare use of screening discussions by PCP characteristics. Adjusted odds of discussing screening and recommending the PSA test were determined from logistic regression. Results: Eighty percent of PCPs reported that they routinely discuss prostate cancer screening with all of their male patients, and 64.1% of PCPs who discussed screening with any patients reported that they attempted to talk their patients into getting the PSA test. In multivariate analyses, encouraging PSA testing was more likely among non-Hispanic black PCPs (OR=2.80, 95% CI [1.88, 4.16]), PCPs serving 100 or more patients per week (OR=2.16, 95% CI [1.38, 3.37]), and PCPs spending longer hours per week in direct patient care (31-40 hours: OR=1.90, 95% CI [1.13, 3.20]; 41 or more hours: OR=2.09, 95% CI [1.12, 3.88]), compared to their referents. PCPs in multi-specialty group practice were more likely to remain neutral or discourage PSA testing compared to PCPs in solo practice. Conclusions: Both individual and practice-related factors of PCPs were associated with the use of prostate cancer screening discussions by U.S. PCPs. Results from this study may prove valuable to researchers and clinicians and help guide the development and implementation of future prostate cancer screening interventions in the U.S.",CHHS,Public Health,2011.0

This study thematically analyzed data from focus groups with service providers (n = 43) who work with pregnant and parenting adolescents to learn about barriers and strategies for addressing IPV. Service providers described four primary barriers to addressing IPV with their adolescent clients: adolescent clients' definitions of love, intergenerational relationship patterns, cultural norms about gender and violence, and developmental-contextual considerations. Service providers also indicated that they respond to adolescents' IPV related concerns by taking steps to identify IPV, building working relationships, and taking appropriate follow-up action. Results suggest that providers can benefit from increased training and skill development in working with IPV, as well as working in interdisciplinary, collaborative teams to increase effectiveness with challenging cases. Programs should consider integrating IPV prevention initiatives that target broader social norms.

This study examined the relationship between media use during discretionary hours after school and psychological and physical assets among preadolescent girls. Methods: A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using data from a larger quasi-experimental evaluation of a positive youth development program through sport for third- to fifth-grade girls. Indicators of media use were the number of hours per school day spent watching television and videos and using computers. Psychological assets included global self-esteem, body size satisfaction, and commitment to physical activity; physical assets included physical activity. Nested random effects analysis of variance (ANOVA) models were used to examine the relationship between media use and psychological and physical assets controlling for relevant confounding factors. Results: The analytic sample included 1027 participants; most were ≥10 years old, non-White; 27% self-reported ≥4 hours of media use on school days. In adjusted results, media use was inversely associated with self-esteem (p = .008) and commitment to physical activity (p < .001). Time spent using media was not associated with body size satisfaction or physical activity in this age group.

Understanding women's positive and negative experiences can assist health care providers to successfully intervene in helping women lose weight following pregnancy and avoid long-term weight gain and obesity development. Design: Phenomenology, according to Husserl's perspective. Setting: Private location of the women's choosing. Participants: Twenty-six women, who ranged in age from 25 to 35 years, and had given birth within the last 5 years, were interviewed regarding their experiences with postpartum weight loss. The majority of the sample was Caucasian. Interviews were transcribed and themes were identified from each of the interviews. Comparisons were made between interviews to identify common experiences between women. Data were analyzed according to the Giorgi method. The women in the study had a wide range of experiences. Themes that emerged from the interviews related to women's challenges with return to prepregnancy weight. These included: time and motivation issues, the need for support, and weight and other struggles. This study provides a look inside the lives of women faced with the reality of losing weight after childbirth. Losing weight after delivery is multi-faceted and influenced by many factors.

Moderate resolution (30m) lidar-based LAI estimates were aggregated to the resolution of the 1-km MODIS LAI product and compared to temporally-coincident MODIS retrievals. Differences in the MODIS and lidar-derived values of LAI were grouped and analyzed by several different factors, including MODIS retrieval algorithm, sun/sensor geometry, and sub-pixel heterogeneity in both vegetation and terrain characteristics. Of particular interest is the disparity in the results when MODIS LAI was analyzed according to algorithm retrieval class. We observed relatively good agreement between lidar-derived and MODIS LAI values for pixels retrieved with the main RT algorithm without saturation for LAI LAI≤4. Moreover, for the entire range of LAI values, considerable overestimation of LAI (relative to lidar-derived LAI) occurred when either the main RT with saturation or back-up algorithm retrievals were used to populate the composite product regardless of sub-pixel vegetation structural complexity or sun/sensor geometry. These results are significant because algorithm retrievals based on the main radiative transfer algorithm with or without saturation are characterized as suitable for validation and subsequent ecosystem modeling, yet the magnitude of difference appears to be specific to retrieval quality class and vegetation structural characteristics.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2011.0

Such revitalization projects engage residents in collective efforts to enhance their neighborhood and, in the process, strengthen neighborhood ties. While the collective efforts often significantly improve deteriorating neighborhoods, they also may increase residents' attachment to the place. Participant observation of three community led park revitalization projects, focus groups exploring the notion of parks attachment in East St. Louis, and interviews with community activists and park district employees have provided the qualitative data used in this paper to arrive at three main conclusions. First, with few resources for physical improvements of parks, mobilization of neighborhood residents encourages innovative and creative ways to improve the quality of everyday life in that neighborhood. Second, the presence of an external organization with resources and experience can support the mobilization of local resources, and is often necessary for successful implementation of changes envisioned by community residents. Finally, active community participation in revitalization projects and ensuring community ownership of ideas are important steps that enhance attachment to a neighborhood park space and thereby enable its continued use and maintenance.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2010.0

2-s2.0-81455143663,Article,"The adoption of XACML as the standard for specifying access control policies for various applications, especially web services is vastly increasing. This calls for high performance XACML policy evaluation engines. A policy evaluation engine can easily become a bottleneck when enforcing XACML policies with a large number of rules. In this paper we propose an adaptive approach for XACML policy optimization. We apply a clustering technique to policy sets based on the K-means algorithm. In addition to clustering we find that, since a policy set has a variable number of policies and a policy has a variable number of rules, their ordering is important for efficient execution. By clustering policy sets and reordering policies and rules in a policy set and policies respectively, we formulated and solved the optimal policy execution problem. The proposed clustering technique categorizes policies and rules within a policy set and policy respectively in respect to target subjects. When a request is received, it is redirected to applicable policies and rules that correspond to its subjects; hence, avoiding unnecessary evaluations from occurring. We also propose a usage based framework that computes access request statistics to dynamically optimize the ordering access control to policies within a policy set and rules within a policy. Reordering is applied to categorized policies and rules from our proposed clustering technique. To evaluate the performance of our framework, we conducted extensive experiments on XACML policies. We evaluated separately the improvement due to categorization and to reordering techniques, in order to assess the policy sets targeted by our techniques. The experimental results show that our approach is orders of magnitude more efficient than standard Sun PDP.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2011.0

The purpose of the present research is to further examine the viability of frequency-based personality measurement as an alternative to traditional (Likert-type) measurement and to assess the usefulness of the variance-based parameters. Toward this end, three studies are presented. Specifically, Study 1 examined relationships between a frequency-based measure of the Big Five personality traits and several motivational variables. Study 2 examined the moderating role of temporal consistency information (provided by frequency-based measurement) on relationships between personality and peer ratings of task performance. Study 3 compared the frequency-based measure to a Likert-type measure with respect to each measure's susceptibility to deliberate response distortion.

Participants: American Board of Surgery-certified GSs regardless of subspecialty (n=1187) performing 460 881 operations on adults 18 years or older. Main Outcome Measures: Workload composition based on the Clinical Classification System, complications identified by patient safety indicators, and in-hospital mortality. Poisson regression with robust error variance estimated adjusted rate ratios (RRs) for complications and mortality. Results: Compared with late-career surgeons, the rate of complications from cardiovascular procedures was higher for surgeons in the early-career phase (RR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.06-1.44) and the late middle-career phase (1.18; 1.02-1.37).

Combining a digital terrain model (DTM) derived from last-return light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data with IKONOS multispectral imagery in a maximum likelihood supervised classification resulted in a 7.1% increase in overall classification accuracy among seven classes (red mangrove, black mangrove, tropical hardwood hammock, coastal rock barren vegetation, mudflat, sand/rock and asphalt) compared with using the multispectral imagery alone, and the classification accuracy was improved for all fourspectrally similar vegetation classes. A digital canopy model (DCM) was createdby subtracting the digital terrain model from a digital surface model derived from LiDAR first returns. The DCM-recorded heights well correlated with mangrove canopy heights measured in the field but were systematically lower, by up to 2 m, for the tallest canopy. LiDAR has been documented to underestimate vegetation heights but the presence of water beneath some of the red mangrove canopy probably exacerbated this effect.

This study explored the relationship between CFT member attendance consistency and the fidelity of wraparound team level implementation processes in a System of Care (SOC). Specifically, utilizing Participant Rating Form (PRF) data collected from caregivers, facilitators, youth, supportive persons, and service providers, as well as meeting attendance records, the relationship between team attendance consistency and fidelity of wraparound implementation was explored. Records for 88 teams, with a total of 2,643 members' ratings of CFT meetings between 2004 and 2009, were examined. Analyses indicate that the structural team factors of attendance consistency and mean team members present relate to CFT members' ratings of team functioning and the degree to which meeting processes are consistent with the tenets of wraparound. Team attendance variables related to the views of meeting functioning by facilitators, service providers, and caregivers, the individuals most often responsible for implementation of the plan of care, but not ratings by youth or supportive persons. These findings have implications for policy and the successful implementation of wraparound, underscoring the relevance of attending to and tracking the composition of the CFT and more actively encouraging consistent meeting attendance.

We then implement a quasi-experimental before-and-after methodology using two alternate transit corridors to control for differences between neighborhoods that contain LRT stations and other neighborhoods. We find light rail does not actually increase crime around stations. Instead, we see a decrease in property crimes once the station locations are announced, which remains relatively stable after the light rail begins operating.",Business,Economics,2011.0

Research suggests rural areas may have higher non-urgent ED visit rates. Such research rarely accounts for spatial factors that may bias results, and is often limited to dichotomous rurality measures, either ""rural"" or ""urban"". We examined the association between multiple levels of rurality and ED visits in South Carolina. Controlling for spatial effects, the distance of Community Health Centers from the cores of populated areas (centroids), and the percentage of the population in poverty, increasing levels of rurality predicted higher rates of uninsured ED visits, non-urgent ED visits, non-urgent privately insured ED visits, and non-urgent uninsured ED visits. Results also demonstrated that estimates of effects of rurality on ED use that do not account for spatial random effects would be biased.",CHHS,Public Health,2011.0
2-s2.0-82455184315,Article,"This study develops a theoretical model on the role of multidimensional status and status inconsistency in market evaluation processes. A product or an organization may acquire multiple status indicators in association with a multitude of market institutions. We argue that when status indicators are consistently positive, each exerts a greater positive effect on the valuation of a product or an organization; conversely, inconsistency among multiple indicators undermines the status claim. We test this theoretical proposition by examining patterns of product valuation in the California premium wine market. Our findings show that when an individual wine's tasting score rated by critics and another more general status indicator-classified appellation affiliation, extra designation on the label, or a winery's organizational status-are consistently positive, each makes a greater contribution to wine price. In contrast, when status indicators are inconsistent, the value of the positive status indicator is reduced. Our study explicates the scope conditions under which market status may yield different outcomes and sheds light on the interplay among status indicators in market valuation.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Sociology,2011.0

STARS goals include retaining and graduating undergraduates and recruiting and bridging undergraduates into graduate programs. The alliance works toward these goals through activities that advance the central values of Technical Excellence, Leadership, Community, and Service and Civic Engagement. In particular, all STARS college and university members implement the STARS Leadership Corps (SLC), an innovative model for enveloping a diverse set of BPC practices within a common framework for implementation within multiple organizations, common assessment, and sustainability through curricula integration. Herein, we describe the SLC model and its implementation in the STARS schools, including details of an SLC service-learning course that has been adopted by eight STARS schools. We report the results of our three-year study of the SLC in the 20 STARS schools. Our study found a positive effect of participation in the SLC on important student success variables, including self-efficacy, perceived social relevance of computing, grade point average, and commitment to remain in computing.

2-s2.0-82455198569,Article,"Geomorphic mapping in the upper Conejos River Valley of the San Juan Mountains has shown that three distinct periods of aggradation have occurred since the end of the last glacial maximum (LGM). The first occurred during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition (~. 12.5-9.5. ka) and is interpreted as paraglacial landscape response to deglaciation after the LGM. Evidence of the second period of aggradation is limited but indicates a small pulse of sedimentation at ~. 5.5. ka. A third, more broadly identifiable period of sedimentation occurred in the late Holocene (~. 2.2-1. ka). The latest two periods of aggradation are concurrent with increases in the frequency of climate change in the region suggesting that Holocene alpine and sub-alpine landscapes respond more to rapid changes in climate than to large singular climatic swings. Soil development and radiocarbon dating indicate that hillslopes were stable during the Holocene even while aggradation was occurring in valley bottoms. Thus, we can conclude that erosion does not occur equally throughout the landscape but is focused upslope of headwater streams, along tributary channels, or on ridge tops. This is in contrast to some models which assume equal erosion in headwater basins.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2011.0
2-s2.0-82455220936,Article,"The notion of using the evolutionary history encoded within multiple sequence alignments to predict allosteric mechanisms is appealing. In this approach, correlated mutations are expected to reflect coordinated changes that maintain intramolecular coupling between residue pairs. Despite much early fanfare, the general suitability of correlated mutations to predict allosteric couplings has not yet been established. Lack of progress along these lines has been hindered by several algorithmic limitations including phylogenetic artifacts within alignments masking true covariance and the computational intractability of consideration of more than two correlated residues at a time. Recent progress in algorithm development, however, has been substantial with a new generation of correlated mutation algorithms that have made fundamental progress toward solving these difficult problems. Despite these encouraging results, there remains little evidence to suggest that the evolutionary constraints acting on allosteric couplings are sufficient to be recovered from multiple sequence alignments. In this review, we argue that due to the exquisite sensitivity of protein dynamics, and hence that of allosteric mechanisms, the latter vary widely within protein families. If it turns out to be generally true that even very similar homologs display a wide divergence of allosteric mechanisms, then even a perfect correlated mutation algorithm could not be reliably used as a general mechanism for discovery of allosteric pathways.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2012.0

That is, network rigidity calculations are used to account for nonadditivity within entropy components, thus restoring the utility of free-energy decomposition. The DCM outputs a large number of structural characterizations that collectively allow for quantified stability-flexibility relationships (QSFR) to be identified. In this review, we describe the theoretical underpinnings of the DCM and introduce several common QSFR metrics. Application of the DCM across protein families highlights the sensitivity within the set of protein structure residue-to-residue couplings.

Here, we test whether women lawyers face similar challenges before the SCC. Our findings do not reveal any disadvantage for litigation teams with larger proportions of women and, in most instances, such teams have an advantage.

2-s2.0-82555196709,Article,"Data collection is a fundamental function provided by wireless sensor networks. How to efficiently collect sensing data from all sensor nodes is critical to the performance of sensor networks. In this paper, we aim to understand the theoretical limits of data collection in a TDMA-based sensor network in terms of possible and achievable maximum capacity. Previously, the study of data collection capacity has concentrated on large-scale random networks. However, in most of the practical sensor applications, the sensor network is not uniformly deployed and the number of sensors may not be as huge as in theory. Therefore, it is necessary to study the capacity of data collection in an arbitrary network. In this paper, we first derive the upper and lower bounds for data collection capacity in arbitrary networks under protocol interference and disk graph models. We show that a simple BFS tree-based method can lead to order-optimal performance for any arbitrary sensor networks. We then study the capacity bounds of data collection under a general graph model, where two nearby nodes may be unable to communicate due to barriers or path fading, and discuss performance implications. Finally, we provide discussions on the design of data collection under a physical interference model or a Gaussian channel model.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2012.0

2-s2.0-82855161480,Article,"The research presented here argues that identifying the impacts of rail transit on property values is not possible without estimates of both price gradients to transit stations as well as overall property value trends in transit neighborhoods. The latter may highlight a number of secondary impacts of rail transit on nuisance elements such as crime and parking as well as targeted public and private investment along rail-transit corridors. In order to estimate neighborhood property values, one must establish relevant control neighborhoods. In the case of Charlotte, North Carolina, the public planning and funding process provides information on proposed light rail-transit (LRT) corridors that were ultimately not selected as the first alignment in Charlotte's light rail transit system in 2000. Estimation incorporates a difference-in-difference estimator across a range of hedonic models. Preferred estimates highlight that LRT provides a neighborhood impact of 4.0% for single-family properties and 11.3% for condominiums sold within 1. mile of LRT stations. No neighborhood impacts are realized for commercial properties and estimated price gradients provide insignificant impacts across a number of models. Results suggest that LRT investment may be used more as an economic development tool for specific neighborhoods rather than a transportation amenity in cities like Charlotte, which contain sparser development patterns.",Business,Economics,2011.0

2-s2.0-83055180700,Article,"Aim The assumption of equilibrium between organisms and their environment is a standard working postulate in species distribution models (SDMs). However, this assumption is typically violated in models of biological invasions where range expansions are highly constrained by dispersal and colonization processes. Here, we examined how stage of invasion affects the extent to which occurrence data represent the ecological niche of organisms and, in turn, influences spatial prediction of species' potential distributions. Location Six ecoregions in western Oregon, USA. Methods We compiled occurrence data from 697 field plots collected over a 9-year period (2001-09) of monitoring the spread of invasive forest pathogen Phytophthora ramorum. Using these data, we applied ecological-niche factor analysis to calibrate models of potential distribution across different years of colonization. We accounted for natural variation and uncertainties in model evaluation by further investigating three hypothetical scenarios of varying equilibrium in a simulated virtual species, for which the 'true' potential distribution was known. Results We confirm our hypothesis that SDMs calibrated in early stages of invasion are less accurate than models calibrated under scenarios closer to equilibrium. SDMs that are developed in early stages of invasion tend to underpredict the potential range compared to models that are built in later stages of invasion. Main conclusions A full environmental niche of invasive species cannot be effectively captured with data from a realized distribution that is restricted by processes preventing full occupancy of suitable habitats. If SDMs are to be used effectively in conservation and management, stage of invasion needs to be considered to avoid underestimation of habitats at risk of invasion.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2012.0

Previous DTN research mainly focuses on routing and information propagation. However, with large number of wireless devices' participation, how to maintain efficient and dynamic topology of the DTN becomes crucial. In this paper, we study the topology control problem in a predictable DTN where the time-evolving network topology is known a priori or can be predicted. We first model such time-evolving network as a directed space-time graph which includes both spacial and temporal information. The aim of topology control is to build a sparse structure from the original space-time graph such that (1) the network is still connected over time and supports DTN routing between any two nodes; (2) the total cost of the structure is minimized. We prove that this problem is NP-hard, and then propose two greedy-based methods which can significant reduce the total cost of topology while maintain the connectivity over time. Finally, we illustrate how the proposed methods can work for undirected DTNs. Simulations have been conducted on both random DTN networks and real-world DTN tracing data.

2-s2.0-83455212027,Article,"Aim Analyses of species distributions are complicated by various origins of spatial autocorrelation (SAC) in biogeographical data. SAC may be particularly important for invasive species distribution models (iSDMs) because biological invasions are strongly influenced by dispersal and colonization processes that typically create highly structured distribution patterns. We examined the efficacy of using a multi-scale framework to account for different origins of SAC, and compared non-spatial models with models that accounted for SAC at multiple levels. Location We modelled the spatial distribution of an invasive forest pathogen, Phytophthora ramorum, in western USA. Methods We applied one conventional statistical method (generalized linear model, GLM) and one nonparametric technique (maximum entropy, Maxent) to a large dataset on P. ramorum occurrence (n=3787) to develop four types of model that included environmental variables and that either ignored spatial context or incorporated it at a broad scale using trend surface analysis, a local scale using autocovariates, or multiple scales using spatial eigenvector mapping. We evaluated model accuracies and amounts of explained spatial structure, and examined the changes in predictive power of the environmental and spatial variables. Results Accounting for different scales of SAC significantly enhanced the predictive capability of iSDMs. Dramatic improvements were observed when fine-scale SAC was included, suggesting that local range-confining processes are important in P. ramorum spread. The importance of environmental variables was relatively consistent across all models, but the explanatory power decreased in spatial models for factors with strong spatial structure. While accounting for SAC reduced the amount of residual autocorrelation for GLM but not for Maxent, it still improved the performance of both approaches, supporting our hypothesis that dispersal and colonization processes are important factors to consider in distribution models of biological invasions. Main conclusions Spatial autocorrelation has become a paradigm in biogeography and ecological modelling. In addition to avoiding the violation of statistical assumptions, accounting for spatial patterns at multiple scales can enhance our understanding of dynamic processes that explain ecological mechanisms of invasion and improve the predictive performance of static iSDMs.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2012.0
2-s2.0-84055185276,Article,"For nearly three decades, the predominant approach to modeling the latent structure of multitrait-multimethod (MTMM) data in organizational research has involved confirmatory factor analysis (CFA).

This article examines the potential of generalizability theory (G-theory) methods for modeling MTMM data and makes such methods more accessible to organizational researchers. Although G-theory methods have existed for more than half a century, the research literature has yet to provide a clear description and integration of latent models implied by univariate and multivariate G-theory with MTMM data, notions of construct validity, and CFA. To help fill this void, the authors first provide a jargon-free overview of the univariate and multivariate G-theory models and analytically demonstrate linkages between their parameters (variance and covariance components), elements of the MTMM matrices, indices of convergent and discriminant validity, and CFA.

The offshore-indicative calcareous microfossil content of some storm deposits was taphonomically altered or destroyed, and in many cases cores taken 10 m apart provided significantly different storm records. In several low-marsh cores, where bioturbation is more intense, storm deposits were completely unrecognizable using foraminifer or sedimentological analyses. In nearly all cores the sedimentary record of storm deposits was more extensive than the record produced using foraminifers, and, as a result, the sedimentary proxy produced shorter hurricane return periods. While offshore-indicative foraminifers in the salt marshes behind Folly Island are good indicators of their original source and mode of deposition (storm current transport from the shelf by overwash, storm inlet, or via Lighthouse Inlet), their susceptibility to destruction from bioturbation and dissolution suggests that they provide a less accurate or less complete record of storm frequency than previously thought.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2011.0

2-s2.0-84255189111,Article,"Privacy issues have been a serious concern for 802.11 Wireless LAN users. Prior research on privacy issues usually focuses on pseudonym techniques, where the unique, consistent explicit identifiers such as MAC addresses from the users can be frequently changed, and thus it is challenging to track users through those always changing identifiers. However, recent research done by Pang et al. (Pang et al. Proceedings of the 13th Annual ACM International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking, 1997; 99-110) has demonstrated that pseudonyms are not adequate to protect user privacy. The key idea of Pang et al.'s method is to locate implicit identifiers (e.g., IP addresses and port numbers a user frequently visits), build user behavior patterns based on these implicit identifiers, and then apply classification techniques to identify users. In this paper, we first propose a new 802.11 user identification approach through enhanced feature selection and generation for building more accurate user behavior patterns. Our simulation results on 9.27 GB SIGCOMM 2004 wireless data sets demonstrate that our method can achieve better classification rates compared with Pang et al.'s method. Then, we further study how to provide user anonymity, even if implicit identifiers based identification is applied, by introducing a set of 802.11 user anonymization approaches based on bogus traffic injection.

Although cleaning substances are routinely used in hospitals, few studies have addressed their potential adverse respiratory health effects on healthcare professionals (HCPs). This study attempts to identify relationship between work-related exposure to cleaning-related chemicals and development of WRA among HCPs. Methods: Of 5600 HCPs surveyed, 3650 responded to a validated questionnaire about their occupation, asthma diagnosis, variability of asthma symptoms at and away from work, and exposure to individual cleaning substances. Workplace asthma was defined as a categorical variable with four mutually exclusive categories: work-related asthma symptoms (WRAS), work-exacerbated asthma (WEA), occupational asthma (OA) and none. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between self-reported use of cleaning substances and asthma outcomes among HCPs. Results: Prevalences of WRAS, WEA and OA were 3.3%, 1.1% and 0.8%, respectively. The prevalence estimates were generally higher among female than male HCPs. The odds of WRAS and WEA increased in a dose-dependent manner for exposure in the longest job to cleaning agents and disinfectants/sterilants, respectively. For exposure in any job, the odds of WRAS were significantly elevated for both factor 1 (bleach, cleaners/abrasives, toilet cleaners, detergents and ammonia) and factor 2 (glutaraldehyde/ortho- phtaldehyde, chloramines and ethylene oxide). Significantly elevated odds of WEA were observed for exposure to bleach, factor 2 and formalin/formaldehyde.

2-s2.0-84555170159,Article,"Streamit lets users explore visualizations of text streams without prior knowledge of the data. It incorporates incoming documents from a continuous source into an existing visualization context with automatic grouping and separation based on document similarities. Streamit generates document clusters to promote better understanding. To obtain different clusterings, users can adjust the keyword importance on the fly. Topic modeling represents the documents with higher-level semantic meanings. System performance has been optimized to achieve instantaneous animated visualization even for very large data collections. A powerful user interface allows in-depth data analysis. The video shows an example of applying our system on 1,000 US National Science Foundation Information and Intelligent Systems award abstracts funded between March 2000 and August 2003. The visual layout consists of a main window (left view), an animation control panel (bottom), control tools (top right), a keyword table (middle right), and document tables (bottom right). Documents are represented by pies whose size conveys the project's funding. The example shows how clusters of documents are generated and dynamically evolve (move, split, or merge) as new documents are inserted. The simulation places new documents relatively close to similar ones, creating clusters that each have an assigned color. Clusters maintain their colors, which facilitates the visual tracking of their behavior. However, when the system generates new clusters (for example, a cluster splits into two or more clusters), it assigns them unique colors to ease the visual tracking of them as they evolve. For example, in the video, the section from 00:21 to 00:25 shows how the red cluster splits into two clusters: a cluster that keeps the same red color and a new light-blue cluster. Finally, the spiral view (00:3200:35) lets users examine the clusters' temporal trends.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2012.0

The central premise of this theory is that leadership can have important but easy-to-miss indirect effects on organizational factors that shape reform outcomes. To test this question, we examine how transformational leadership influences the implementation of performance reforms, using performance information use as a dependent variable. Previous research suggests that leadership can affect how performance information is used among employees but underspecifies the theoretical mechanisms by which this influence occurs. This article develops a theoretical model that proposes that transformational leaders ""set the table"" for performance information use via a positive but indirect effect on two mediating factors, goal clarity and organizational culture. A structural equation model using self-reported performance information use as a dependent variable provides empirical evidence consistent with our theory.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Political Science and Public Administration,2012.0

METHODS: Self-reported arrest history data (excluding arrests for minor traffic violations) from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 (N = 7335) were examined from 1997 to 2008. RESULTS: By age 18, the in-sample cumulative arrest prevalence rate lies between 15.9% and 26.8%; at age 23, it lies between 25.3% and 41.4%. These bounds make no assumptions at all about missing cases. If we assume that the missing cases are at least as likely to have been arrested as the observed cases, the in-sample age-23 prevalence rate must lie between 30.2% and 41.4%. The greatest growth in the cumulative prevalence of arrest occurs during late adolescence and the period of early or emerging adulthood. CONCLUSIONS: Since the last nationally defensible estimate based on data from 1965, the cumulative prevalence of arrest for American youth (particularly in the period of late adolescence and early adulthood) has increased substantially. At a minimum, being arrested for criminal activity signifies increased risk of unhealthy lifestyle, violence involvement, and violent victimization.

We conducted 42 focus groups (N=396, ages 50+) in four languages, with African Americans, American Indians, Chinese Americans, Latinos, Whites other than Latinos (hereafter, Whites) and Vietnamese Americans, in nine United States locations. Participants discussed concerns about keeping their memory or ability to think as they age. Audio recordings were transcribed verbatim. Constant comparison methods identified themes. In findings, all ethnic groups expressed concern and fear about memory loss, losing independence, and becoming a burden. Knowing someone with Alzheimer's disease increased concern. American Indians, Chinese Americans, Latinos and Vietnamese Americans expected memory loss. American Indians, Chinese Americans and Vietnamese Americans were concerned about stigma associated with Alzheimer's disease. Only African Americans, Chinese and Whites expressed concern about genetic risks. Only African Americans and Whites expressed concern about behaviour changes. Although we asked participants for their thoughts about their ability to think as they age, they focused almost exclusively on memory.

2-s2.0-84855437039,Conference Paper,"Testing is essential for quality assurance of database applications. Achieving high code coverage of the database application is important in testing. In practice, there may exist a copy of live databases that can be used for database application testing. Using an existing database state is desirable since it tends to be representative of real-world objects' characteristics, helping detect faults that could cause failures in real-world settings. However, to cover a specific program code portion (e.g., block), appropriate program inputs also need to be generated for the given existing database state. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel approach that generates program inputs for achieving high code coverage of a database application, given an existing database state. Our approach uses symbolic execution to track how program inputs are transformed before appearing in the executed SQL queries and how the constraints on query results affect the application's execution. One significant challenge in our problem context is the gap between program-input constraints derived from the program and from the given existing database state; satisfying both types of constraints is needed to cover a specific program code portion. Our approach includes novel query formulation to bridge this gap. Our approach is loosely integrated into Pex, a state-of-the-art white-box testing tool for.NET from Microsoft Research. Empirical evaluations on two real database applications show that our approach assists Pex to generate program inputs that achieve higher code coverage than the program inputs generated by Pex without our approach's assistance.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2011.0

The aims of this study were to describe the prevalence, sleep-related correlates, and polysomnographic correlates of PLMD in a large pediatric case series, and compare these to pediatric obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Methods: All PLMD cases (defined by International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd edition criteria + respiratory disturbance index [RDI] < 3) and OSA cases (defined by RDI ≥ 3 + PLMS < 5), from a single pediatric sleep practice, over a 2-year time span, were included. Chart, questionnaire, and polysomnographic data were compiled. Of 468 referred children, 66 PLMD cases were identified (14%). Results: The PLMD cases, mean age 8.1 years (range 1-17), were clinically characterized by frequent sleep onset and maintenance problems, difficulty awakening, restless sleep, leg pain/discomfort at night, and parasomnias. Compared to 90 OSA children, those with PLMD had a history of significantly more sleep onset and maintenance problems, leg pain/discomfort at night, parasomnias, getting out of bed at night, and family history of restless legs syndrome. Polysomnographically, PLMD cases had more awakenings, stage 1 sleep, stage shifts, and spontaneous arousals. Conclusions: These data indicate that pediatric PLMD has important clinical and polysomnographic correlates. In addition, PLMD has many characteristics that are different from pediatric OSA, suggesting that PLMD is a distinct pediatric sleep disorder, of which clinicians should be aware.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Psychology,2011.0

Human-human tutoring offers a valuable model for identifying effective tutorial strategies, but extracting them is a challenge because of the richness of human dialogue. This article addresses that challenge through a machine learning approach that 1) learns tutorial modes from a corpus of human tutoring, and 2) identifies the statistical relationships between student outcomes and the learned modes. The modeling approach utilizes hidden Markov models (HMMs) to capture the unobservable stochastic structure that is thought to influence the observations, in this case dialogue acts and task actions, that are generated by task-oriented tutorial dialogue. We refer to this unobservable layer as the hidden dialogue state, and interpret it as representing the tutor and students' collaborative intentions. We have applied HMMs to a corpus of annotated task-oriented tutorial dialogue to learn one model for each of two effective human tutors. Significant correlations emerged between the automatically extracted tutoring modes and student learning outcomes. Broadly, the results suggest that HMMs can learn meaningful hidden tutorial dialogue structure. More specifically, the findings point to specific mechanisms within task-oriented tutorial dialogue that are associated with increased student learning. This work has direct applications in authoring data-driven tutorial dialogue system behavior and in investigating the effectiveness of human tutoring.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2011.0

The Open Authorization protocol (OAuth) was introduced as a secure and efficient method for authorizing third party applications without releasing a user's access credentials. However, OAuth implementations don't provide the necessary fine-grained access control, nor any recommendations vis-a-vis which access control decisions are most appropriate. We propose an extension to the OAuth 2.0 authorization that enables the provisioning of fine-grained authorization recommendations to users when granting permissions to third party applications. We propose a mechanism that computes permission ratings based on a multi-criteria recommendation model which utilizes previous user decisions, and application requests to enhance the privacy of the overall site's user population. We implemented our proposed OAuth extension as a browser extension that allows users to easily configure their privacy settings at application installation time, provides recommendations on requested privacy attributes, and collects data regarding user decisions.

Crucial to the success of such ambitions is a system that provides equitable access to all residents and one that provides access to a large number of urban opportunities. The purpose of this paper is to explore the spatial accessibility landscape created by newly implemented BRT system in Cali, Colombia in terms of both access to the system itself and access to three distinct activities around the city. In particular, the equitable distribution of accessibility patterns is explored in relation to neighborhood socio-economic strata. Findings indicate that walking access to the BRT system is greatest for middle income groups and most limited for neighborhoods in the highest and lowest socio-economic strata.

In this paper, we extend this research by isolating factors in personality traits as well as in the visualizations that could have contributed to the observed correlation. We focus on a personality trait known as ""locus of control,"" which represents a person's tendency to see themselves as controlled by or in control of external events. To isolate variables of the visualization design, we control extraneous factors such as color, interaction, and labeling, and specifically focus on the overall layout style of the visualizations. We conduct a user study with four visualizations that gradually shift from an indentation metaphor to a containment metaphor and compare the participants' speed, accuracy, and preference with their locus of control. Our findings demonstrate that there is indeed a correlation between the two: participants with an internal locus of control perform more poorly with visualizations that employ a containment metaphor, while those with an external locus of control perform well with such visualizations.

For this reason, network misconfiguration becomes the main source for network unreachablility and vulnerability problems. In this paper, we present a novel approach that models the global end-to-end behavior of access control configurations of the entire network including routers, IPSec, firewalls, and NAT for unicast and multicast packets. Our model represents the network as a state machine where the packet header and location determines the state. The transitions in this model are determined by packet header information, packet location, and policy semantics for the devices being modeled. We encode the semantics of access control policies with Boolean functions using binary decision diagrams (BDDs). We then use computation tree logic (CTL) and symbolic model checking to investigate all future and past states of this packet in the network and verify network reachability and security requirements. Thus, our contributions in this work is the global encoding for network configurations that allows for general reachability and security property-based verification using CTL model checking.

In this study, we use statistical and geospatial modeling on densely sampled forest biomass data to analyze the relative importance of ecological and physiographic variables as determinants of spatial variation of forest biomass in the environmentally heterogeneous region of the Big Sur, California. We estimated biomass in 280 forest plots (one plot per 2. 85 km2) and measured an array of ecological (vegetation community type, distance to edge, amount of surrounding non-forest vegetation, soil properties, fire history) and physiographic drivers (elevation, potential soil moisture and solar radiation, proximity to the coast) of tree growth at each plot location. Our geostatistical analyses revealed that biomass distribution is spatially structured and autocorrelated up to 3. 1 km. Regression tree (RT) models showed that both physiographic and ecological factors influenced biomass distribution. Across randomly selected sample densities (sample size 112 to 280), ecological effects of vegetation community type and distance to forest edge, and physiographic effects of elevation, potential soil moisture and solar radiation were the most consistent predictors of biomass. Topographic moisture index and potential solar radiation had a positive effect on biomass, indicating the importance of topographicallymediated energy and moisture on plant growth and biomass accumulation. RT model explained 35% of the variation in biomass and spatially autocorrelated variation were retained in regession residuals. Regression kriging model, developed from RT combined with kriging of regression residuals, was used to map biomass across the Big Sur.

This study investigated the relationship of impulsivity to readiness to change binge drinking behavior among college students attending a 4-year university. The theoretical formulation for the study was based on Prochaska and DiClemente's transtheoretical model. Participants were volunteer undergraduate college students from a state-supported Southeastern University. The students were recruited from undergraduate classrooms, fraternities, and sororities. The volunteer participants were 248 undergraduate college students enrolled in a 4-year university in the southeastern United States. This study consists of a subgroup, 131 of the 248 participants which were 93 binge drinkers and 38 nondrinkers. Three surveys were administered: the Student Alcohol Questionnaire (SAQ), Barratt's Impulsivity Scale (BIS-11), and the Brief Readiness to Change Questionnaire (BRCQ). Impulsivity was significantly correlated with binge drinking and the transtheoretical stages of change. Impulsivity can result in a lack of inhibitory control, which is a risk factor for binge drinking. The results of this study suggest that impulsivity may interfere with intentional behavioral change. This study may have valuable implications for the current and future design of alcohol prevention programs at institutions of higher education.",CHHS,Nursing,2011.0
2-s2.0-84856083724,Article,"Wanting to elucidate the relationship between student success and employment outcomes, the authors of this study sought to devise a methodology to (a) measure the alignment between the educational/community college experience and potential careers and (b) explore factors that may inform the alignment between college and career. Data were collected on 84 students at a southern community college using the College and Career Capital Survey. Descriptive analyses showed that the majority of the sample was White, female, and worked, and more than half aspired to earn at least a baccalaureate degree. Survey items and responses were used to formulate the College-Career Alignment Index. A stepwise backward regression, used to eliminate noncontributing variables, accounted for 27.4% of the variance and showed the following to be statistically significant in predicting college-career alignment: working full-or part-time, gender (female), relying on institutional networks for information, confidence in finding employment in a desired career field, and enrollment in developmental courses. Based on the findings of this exploratory study, the authors suggest that community colleges consider the value of employment opportunities while in college and the institution's role in providing information about careers as potential avenues to improve college-career alignment. In addition, they propose next steps to expand the study and further explore factors related to career capital.",Education,"Middle, Secondary, and K-12 Education",2012.0

Hundreds of millions of people are posting articles, photos, and videos on their profiles and interacting with other people, but the sharing and interaction are limited within a same social network site. Although users can share some contents in a social network site with people outside of the social network site using a public link of content, appropriate access control mechanisms are still not supported. To overcome those limitations, we propose a cross-site content sharing framework named x-mngr, allowing users to interact with others in other social network sites, with a cross-site access control policy, which enables users to specify policies that allow/deny access to their shared contents across social network sites. We implemented our proposed framework through a photo sharing application that shares user's photos between Facebook and MySpace based on the cross-site access control policy.

Design: Data for the analysis come from a controlled, randomized prospective design conducted from 2003-2005 with the outcome measures taken pre-, mid-, and post-intervention. Setting: Data were collected from participants in their homes in an urban community in North Carolina. Participants: Participants (N=147) were adults aged 60+ with a diagnosis of hypertension and/or hyperlipidemia. Intervention: Intervention recipients received three sessions of MNT throughout the 1 year study period. The control group received nutrition information at enrollment. Measurements: Participants completed a dietary knowledge questionnaire and a 24 dietary recall at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. Instrumental variables models with participant fixed effects were used to determine the impact of MNT on dietary knowledge and dietary knowledge on DASH diet adherence. Results: Among those who received MNT, dietary knowledge increased from baseline to twelve months (p<.01). Changes in dietary knowledge were not associated with changes in DASH adherence from baseline to 12 months (p=0.44). Conclusions: The MNT administered was effective at improving dietary knowledge, but not at improving DASH adherence. Three MNT sessions may be insufficient to change behavior.

Joint laxity is often measured through the use of manual stress tests, stress radiography, and instrumented ankle arthrometers. Purpose: To systematically review the literature to establish the influence of chronic ankle instability (CAI) on sagittal and frontal plane mechanical joint laxity. Data Sources: Articles were searched with MEDLINE (1966 to October 2008), CINAHL (1982 to October 2008), and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (to October 2008) using the key words chronic ankle instability and joint laxity, functional ankle instability and joint laxity, and lateral ankle sprains and joint laxity. Study Selection: To be included, studies had to employ a case control design; mechanical joint laxity had to be measured via a stress roentogram, an instrumented ankle arthrometer, or ankle/foot stress-testing device; anteroposterior inversion or eversion ankle-subtalar joint complex laxity had to be measured; and means and standard deviations of CAI and control groups had to be provided. Data Extraction: One investigator assessed each study based on the criteria to ensure its suitability for analysis. The initial search yielded 1378 potentially relevant articles, from which 8 were used in the final analysis. Once the study was accepted for inclusion, its quality was assessed with the PEDro scale. Data Synthesis: Twenty-one standardized effect sizes and their 95% confidence intervals were computed for each group and dependent variable. CAI produced the largest effect on inversion joint laxity; 45% of the effects ranged from 0.84 to 2.61. Anterior joint laxity measures were influenced second most by CAI (effects, 0.32 to 1.82). CAI had similar but less influence on posterior joint laxity (effects, -0.06 to 0.68) and eversion joint laxity (effects, 0.03 to 0.69).

2-s2.0-84856439602,Article,"Two conflicting definitions of desistance exist in the criminology literature. The first definition is instantaneous desistance in which an offender simply chooses to end a criminal career instantaneously moving to a zero rate of offending (). The second definition views desistance as a process by which the offending rate declines steadily over time to zero or to a point close to zero (; ; ). In this article, we capitalize on the underlying assumptions of several parametric survival distributions to gain a better understanding of which of these models best describes actual patterns of desistance. All models are examined using 18 years of follow-up data on a cohort of felony convicts in Essex County, NJ. Our analysis leads us to three conclusions. First, some people have already desisted at the beginning of the follow-up period, which is consistent with the notion of ""instantaneous desistance."" Second, a three-parameter model that allows for a turning point in the risk of recidivism followed by a long period of decline fits the data best. This conclusion suggests that for those offenders active at the start of the study period, the risk of recidivism is declining over time. However, we also find that a simpler two-group model fits the data almost as well and gains superiority in the later years of follow-up. This last point is particularly relevant as it suggests that the observed gradual decline in the hazard over time is a result of a compositional effect rather than of a pattern of individually declining hazards.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Criminal Justice and Criminology,2012.0

The sedimentology and sequence stratigraphy of the cores document changing sedimentary provenance, processes, and rates. Brown's Cove was flooded in 1924, resulting in a transgressive sequence composed dominantly of suspension load deposited between 1924 and 1983. Based on air photos and cores, distributary channels on Beaverdam Creek delta supplied sediment to prograding, coarseningupward delta lobes composed of turbidites grading up to traction load deposits. In 1983, a delta lobe began prograding into Brown's Cove and was abandoned ca. 1993, leading to compaction, subsidence, and a second transgression. Another distributary avulsed to the site ca. 2003, resulting in a second prograding delta lobe. Prior to flooding of Brown's Cove, mafic-rich fluvial sediments from the southern part of the watershed were a large component of the sediment. Between 1983 and 1993, felsic-rich sediments from the recently clear-cut northern part of the watershed dominated. The youngest sediments are mafic-rich and likely due to extensive land clearances in the southern part of the watershed that began in 2004. Three methods of estimating sedimentation rates for the main part of Brown's Cove provide comparable results of ~1 cm/yr averaged over the full period of record. This estimate can be refined to ~0.6 cm/yr for the interval 1924- 2003, and ~1.8 cm/yr for the interval 2003-2008.

This is considered a risk factor in progressive cartilage degeneration and the early onset of osteoarthritis following ACL injury and even after reconstructive surgery. The purpose of this study was to examine 3D joint kinematics of ACL-deficient and ACL-reconstructed knees to health controls during stair ascent and descent. A 3D optical video motion capture system was used to record coordinate data from reflective markers positioned on subjects as they ascended and descended a custom-built staircase. Spatiotemporal gait and knee joint kinematic variables were calculated and further analyzed. The ACL-deficient knees exhibited a significant extension deficit compared to the ACL-intact controls. A more varus and internally rotated tibial position was also identified in the ACL-deficient knees during both stair ascent and descent. The ACL-reconstructed knees exhibited less abnormality in both spatiotemporal gait parameters and joint kinematics, but these variables were not fully restored to a normal level. The kinematic profiles of the ACL-reconstructed knees were more similar to those of the ACL-deficient knees when compared to the ACL-intact knees. This suggests that the ACL-reconstructed knees had been ""under-corrected"" rather than ""over-corrected"" by the reconstructive surgery procedure.

Self-efficacy, a widely used psychosocial concept, is associated with the ability to manage chronic disease. In this study, we examine the association between self-efficacy to manage hypertension and six clinically prescribed hypertension self-care behaviors. We interviewed 190 African Americans with hypertension who resided in the greater metropolitan Charlotte area about their self-efficacy and their hypertension self-care activities. Logistic regression for correlated observations was used to model the relationship between self-efficacy and adherence to hypertension self-care behaviors. Since the hypertension self-care behavior outcomes were not rare occurrences, an odds ratio correction method was used to provide a more reliable measure of the prevalence ratio (PR). Over half (59%) of participants reported having good self-efficacy to manage their hypertension. Good self-efficacy was statistically significantly associated with increased prevalence of adherence to medication (PR = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.32), eating a low-salt diet (PR = 1.64, 95% CI: 1.07-2.20), engaging in physical activity (PR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.08-1.39), not smoking (PR = 1.10, 95% CI: 1.01-1.15), and practicing weight management techniques (PR = 1.63, 95% CI: 1.30-1.87).

In Part I, the modulation of eyewall convection via the rotation of vorticity asymmetries through the downshear-left quadrant was documented during rapid intensification. Here, the focus is on the relationship between VWS, vortex tilt, and associated asymmetry within the tropical cyclone core region during two separate observation periods. A method for estimating local VWS and vortex tilt from radar datasets is further developed, and the resulting vertical structure and its evolution are subjected to statistical confidence tests. Guillermo was a highly resilient vortex, evidenced by its small tilt magnitude relative to the horizontal scale of the vortex core. The deep-layer tilt was statistically significant, oriented on average ̃60° left of shear. Large-scale vorticity and thermal asymmetries oriented along the tilt direction support a response of Guillermo to shear forcing that is consistent with balanced dynamics. The time-averaged vertical motion asymmetry within the eyewall exhibited maximum ascent values ̃40° left of the deep-layer shear, or in this case, right of the deep-layer tilt. The observation-based analysis of Guillermo's interaction with VWS confirms findings of recent theoretical and numerical studies, and serves as the basis for a more comprehensive investigation of VWS and tropical cyclone intensity change using a recently constructed multistorm database of Doppler radar analyses.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2012.0

This massively parallel processing platform holds considerable promise for meeting the computing requirement of agent-based models of spatial problems. In this article, we focus on the parallelization of an agent-based spatial opinion model using GPU technologies. We discussed key algorithms designed for parallel agent-based opinion modeling: including domain decomposition and mutual exclusion. Experiments conducted to examine computing performance show that GPUs provide a computationally efficient alternative to traditional parallel computing architectures and substantially accelerate agent-based models of large-scale opinion exchange among individual decision makers.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2012.0

We explore which family policies are most effective at directly reducing poverty among families with children, and whether these policies indirectly reduce poverty through supporting mothers' employment. We combine microdata from the Luxembourg Income Study with the Work-Family Policy Indicators dataset, and use multilevel logistic regressions to examine the associations between policy and poverty, controlling for individual-level factors. We find significant effects of family allowances, generous parental leaves and childcare provisions, with more powerful effects for single mothers. We further show that parental leave and childcare operate through boosting mothers' employment, illustrating that work-family policies are useful for reducing poverty by enhancing mother's employment.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Sociology,2012.0
2-s2.0-84857463893,Article,"Exotic pathogens and pests threaten ecosystem service, biodiversity, and crop security globally. If an invasive agent can disperse asymptomatically over long distances, multiple spatial and temporal scales interplay, making identification of effective strategies to regulate, monitor, and control disease extremely difficult. The management of outbreaks is also challenged by limited data on the actual area infested and the dynamics of spatial spread, due to financial, technological, or social constraints. We examine principles of landscape epidemiology important in designing policy to prevent or slow invasion by such organisms, and use Phytophthora ramorum, the cause of sudden oak death, to illustrate how shortfalls in their understanding can render management applications inappropriate. This pathogen has invaded forests in coastal California, USA, and an isolated but fast-growing epidemic focus in northern California (Humboldt County) has the potential for extensive spread. The risk of spread is enhanced by the pathogen's generalist nature and survival. Additionally, the extent of cryptic infection is unknown due to limited surveying resources and access to private land. Here, we use an epidemiological model for transmission in heterogeneous landscapes and Bayesian Markov-chain-Monte-Carlo inference to estimate dispersal and life-cycle parameters of P. ramorum and forecast the distribution of infection and speed of the epidemic front in Humboldt County. We assess the viability of management options for containing the pathogen's northern spread and local impacts. Implementing a stand-alone host-free ""barrier"" had limited efficacy due to long-distance dispersal, but combining curative with preventive treatments ahead of the front reduced local damage and contained spread. While the large size of this focus makes effective control expensive, early synchronous treatment in newly-identified disease foci should be more cost-effective. We show how the successful management of forest ecosystems depends on estimating the spatial scales of invasion and treatment of pathogens and pests with cryptic long-distance dispersal.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2012.0

2-s2.0-84857467602,Article,"The transcription factor Osterix (Sp7) is essential for osteoblastogenesis and bone formation in mice. Genome wide association studies have demonstrated that Osterix is associated with bone mineral density in humans; however, the molecular significance of Osterix in human osteoblast differentiation is poorly described. In this study we have characterized the role of Osterix in human mesenchymal progenitor cell (hMSC) differentiation. We first analyzed temporal microarray data of primary hMSC treated with bone morphogenetic protein-6 (BMP6) using clustering to identify genes that are associated with Osterix expression. Osterix clusters with a set of osteoblast-associated extracellular matrix (ECM) genes, including bone sialoprotein (BSP) and a novel set of proteoglycans, osteomodulin (OMD), osteoglycin, and asporin. Maximum expression of these genes is dependent upon both the concentration and duration of BMP6 exposure. Next we overexpressed and repressed Osterix in primary hMSC using retrovirus. The enforced expression of Osterix had relatively minor effects on osteoblastic gene expression independent of exogenous BMP6. However, in the presence of BMP6, Osterix overexpression enhanced expression of the aforementioned ECM genes. Additionally, Osterix overexpression enhanced BMP6 induced osteoblast mineralization, while inhibiting hMSC proliferation. Conversely, Osterix knockdown maintained hMSC in an immature state by decreasing expression of these ECM genes and decreasing mineralization and hMSC proliferation. Overexpression of the Osterix regulated gene OMD with retrovirus promoted mineralization of hMSC. These results suggest that Osterix is necessary, but not sufficient for hMSC osteoblast differentiation. Osterix regulates the expression of a set of ECM proteins which are involved in terminal osteoblast differentiation.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2012.0

In this paper, we propose a methodology to quantitatively evaluate a visual analytics (VA) system based on measuring what is learned by its users as the users reapply the knowledge to a different problem or domain. The motivation for this methodology is based on the observation that the ultimate goal of a user of a VA system is to gain knowledge of and expertise with the dataset, task, or tool itself. We propose a framework for describing and measuring knowledge gain in the analytical process based on these three types of knowledge and discuss considerations for evaluating each. We propose that through careful design of tests that examine how well participants can reapply knowledge learned from using a VA system, the utility of the visualization can be more directly assessed.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2010.0

2-s2.0-84857790248,Article,"Disease ecology has made important steps in describing how epidemiological processes control the impact of pathogens on populations and communities but fewer field or theoretical studies address disease effects at the ecosystem level. We demonstrate that the same epidemiological mechanisms drive disease intensity and coarse woody debris (CWD) dynamics in natural forest ecosystems impacted by an emerging disease. Sudden oak death (causal agent, Phytophthora ramorum) has caused mortality of tanoak (Notholithocarpus densiflorus) on a spatial scale and rate comparable to other major North American forest diseases caused by invasive pathogens. In pathogen invaded stands, mean CWD masses were 22.4 Mg ha -1 of standing dead tanoak (snags) and 11.5 Mg ha -1 in logs compared to 0.27 and 1.16 Mg ha -1 of snags and logs in an uninvaded stand. Within invaded stands variation in CWD mass and accumulation rates were largely driven by the distribution of pre-disease tanoak biomass and the densities of infected tanoak and California bay laurel (Umbellularia californica) which jointly determine P. ramorum sporulation and disease emergence rates. In a narrow range of community and host characteristics sudden oak death can result in woody debris dynamics similar to discrete disturbances such as fire and forest harvest but it is more common to have lower maximum amounts with slower rates of accumulation than these better studied disturbances. Our results indicate that models of CWD dynamics need to integrate epidemiological processes to predict realistic ecosystem impacts and lead to management applications for forest pathogens.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2012.0

2-s2.0-84858002660,Article,"Retailers use various promotions, such as gift cards, to increase profits. When retailers give gift cards "" free"" to consumers who spend above specified thresholds in a single purchase, some consumers may buy more goods. We develop a model to derive the optimal purchase amount thresholds and gift card values. The model is developed for consumers without and then with a spending constraint. We find that the retailer's profit margin, the degree of forward buying and stockpiling, and use of gift cards in future purchases that would have been made with cash, are the most important factors in determining the profitability of gift cards. Gift cards may be very profitable for high-margin retailers who can limit the degree of forward buying and stockpiling, particularly when consumers use gift cards to buy goods they would not have bought from the retailer without gift cards. If this is how consumers use the gift cards, then consumers spending above the cards' value at redemption can significantly increase their profitability. Without a consumer spending constraint, it is best for the retailer to offer at most one gift card at a large purchase amount. With a consumer spending constraint, it may be profitable to give gift cards at multiple purchase amount thresholds. We also show that the commonly observed policy of giving gift cards at equally spaced purchase amounts may be profitable when forward buying and stockpiling can be controlled. Moreover, we show that gift cards become more profitable when consumers are inconsistent, that is, they overestimate their probability of redeeming the gift card at purchase time. Finally, gift cards may have only a slight profit advantage over discounts if consumers are consistent. Consumer inconsistency and spending above the cards' value increase this advantage.",Business,BISOM,2011.0

However, few reports have examined the physical activity-dementia association with objective measures of physical activity. Cardiorespiratory fitness (hereafter called fitness) is an objective reproducible measure of recent physical activity habits. Purpose: We sought to determine whether fitness is associated with lower risk for dementia mortality in women and men. Methods: We followed 14,811 women and 45,078 men, age 20-88 yr at baseline, for an average of 17 yr. All participants completed a preventive health examination at the Cooper Clinic in Dallas, TX, during 1970-2001. Fitness was measured with a maximal treadmill exercise test, with results expressed in maximal METs. The National Death Index identified deaths through 2003. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the association between baseline fitness and dementia mortality, adjusting for age, sex, examination year, body mass index, smoking, alcohol use, abnormal ECGs, and health status. Results: There were 164 deaths with dementia listed as the cause during 1,012,125 person-years of exposure. Each 1-MET increase in fitness was associated with a 14% lower adjusted risk of dementia mortality (95% confidence interval (CI) = 6%-22%). With fitness expressed in tertiles, adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for those in the middle- and high-fitness groups suggest their risk of dementia mortality was less than half that of those in the lowest fitness group (HR = 0.44, CI = 0.26-0.74 and HR = 0.49, CI = 0.26-0.90, respectively).

Objective: To investigate the association between workplace and housing conditions and farmworker use of pesticide safety practices and PPE. Methods: This study was conducted in 4 counties in North Carolina, USA, from July to October, 2010, during the agricultural growing season. Farmworkers working in agriculture aged 18 to 62 (n=187) were administered a structured questionnaire to collect self-reported measures on housing and workplace conditions. Use of pesticide safety and PPE were examined by asking questions about wearing gloves, wearing socks, and wearing a hat. Chi-square and multiple logistic regression analyses were used for statistical analyses. Results: Farmworkers reporting availability of enough hot and cold water for bathing and doing laundry were 13.6 times more likely to use pesticide safety practices (adjusted OR: 13.6, 95% CI: 1.4-135.4), whereas, those who reported that soap for handwashing was always or usually available while doing agricultural work were 7.8 times more likely to use pesticide safety practices (adjusted OR: 7.8, 95% CI: 3.3-18.5).

Using RNA-seq data to assess splicing at the level of individual genes requires the ability to visualize read alignments alongside genomic annotations. To meet this need, we added RNA-seq visualization capability to Integrated Genome Browser (IGB), a free desktop genome visualization tool. To illustrate this capability, we present an in-depth analysis of abiotic stresses and their effects on alternative splicing of SR45a (AT1G07350), a putative splicing regulator from Arabidopsis thaliana. Methods: cDNA libraries prepared from Arabidopsis plants that were subjected to heat and dehydration stresses were sequenced on an Illumina GAIIx sequencer, yielding more than 511 million high-quality 75-base, single-end sequence reads. Reads were aligned onto the reference genome and visualized in IGB. Key results: Using IGB, we confirmed exon-skipping alternative splicing in SR45a. Exon-skipped variant AT1G07350.1 encodes full-length SR45a protein with intact RS and RNA recognition motifs, while nonskipped variant AT1G07350.2 lacks the C-terminal RS region due to a frameshift in the alternative exon. Heat and drought stresses increased both transcript abundance and the proportion of exon-skipped transcripts encoding the full-length protein. We identified new splice sites and observed frequent intron retention flanking the alternative exon. Conclusions: This study underlines the importance of visual inspection of RNA-seq alignments when investigating alternatively spliced genes. We showed that heat and dehydration stresses increase overall abundance of SR45a mRNA while also increasing production of transcripts encoding the full-length SR45a protein relative to other splice variants.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2012.0

The science teachers implemented four science units representing three of eight national science content standards. A fourth standard, science as inquiry, was embedded within each of the units. Results showed students made gains in respective content areas. Students who received instruction in math scored higher than students who received instruction in science on the posttest of math skills. Likewise, students who received instruction in science scored higher than students who received instruction in math on the posttest of science vocabulary skills.

2-s2.0-84858951932,Conference Paper,"The Pebble Game (PG) algorithm is an efficient method to characterize protein exibility. The PG calculates several mechanical graph rigidity quantities based on a network of chemical interactions. Because noncovalent chemical interactions continually break and reform, a distinct PG calculation is necessary for each network topology. As such, equilibrium properties are calculated by averaging over an ensemble of input networks, each with an accompanying PG characterization. We have recently developed a new mean field approach, called the Virtual Pebble Game (VPG), that speeds up calculation times by eliminating sampling. Here, we test a hybrid VPG-x algorithm that combines the advantages of both by applying the mean field approximation to some interactions while sampling the rest. Across several different quantitative and qualitative comparisons, the VPG-x algorithm consistently outperforms the strictly mean-field VPG.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2011.0

2-s2.0-84858953615,Conference Paper,"Traditionally, tree-based spatial data structures such as k- d trees or hash-based structures such as spatial hashing are used to accelerate collision detection, and navigation meshes are used for agent path planning. In this paper, we present a series of algorithms to replace the traditional tree-based spatial data structures with the graph-based navigation-mesh. The advantages of using a single data structure for both agent navigation and collision detection acceleration are two- fold. First, the costs of constructing and maintaining two unique data structures are cut in half if a single data structure provides both spatial groupings for rapid collision detection and search space reduction for path planning. Second, using one spatial structure, development time can be shorter and, at runtime, there is generally less memory overhead. We present the results of an experiment that compares a navigation mesh as a collision detection accelerator to two popular and commonly used forms of spatial data structures, the k-d tree and the spatial hash map. We also compare its performance to a world without any spatial data structures to provide a baseline of performance. Our results show a fifty percent decrease in collision detection time between dynamic objects in comparison to k-d trees. In addition, until the number of objects present in the world exceeds three thousand the navigation mesh accelerated collision detection outperforms spatial hashing accelerated collision detection across all tests.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2011.0

2-s2.0-84859053115,Article,"Several theoretical models have been proposed to explain consumers' ethical decision-making process in the context of piracy; however, there is limited understanding of various risks involved in online music piracy. By integrating the literature on consumer choice, technology adoption, and piracy, we conceptualize consumers' perceived piracy risk as a second-order construct formed by seven subconstructs. Later, our empirical analysis suggests that these seven subconstructs converge into five distinct components in the context of digital music piracy: moral awareness, monetary loss, performance, time, and privacy risk. We find that moral awareness risk is the key determinant of consumer piracy risk. Furthermore, we investigate whether the amount of content pirated by consumers affects their perception of piracy risk. Our analysis indicates that consumers' perceived piracy risk cost does not increase with the amount of content pirated, suggesting that a consumer's piracy risk cost is fixed. However, the relative importance of privacy and monetary loss risk components in determining the overall piracy risk increases when consumers download more songs illegally. Our proposed measure enables researchers and practitioners to quantify risk and provides novel insights into pricing and piracy control strategies.",Business,BISOM,2012.0
2-s2.0-84859123898,"General Publications (Press, Editorials, Letters)","INTRODUCTION The idea of race, so intrinsic a part of American social life, is a surprisingly ephemeral one. The ancient world conceptualized human diversity in purely local terms, and the idea that the human species could be naturally partitioned into a reasonably small number of reasonably discrete kinds of people does not seem to have been seriously entertained until the late seventeenth century (Hannaford, 1996; Hudson, 1996; Jahoda, 1999; Stuurman, 2000). The term “race” was introduced into biological discourse by Buffon in the eighteenth century, but he used the term in an entirely colloquial, not taxonomic, way. In this sense the term meant the equivalent of a “strain” or “variety”-a group of organisms linked by the possession of familial features. Buffon's rival Linnaeus, the founder of modern taxonomy, divided humans into four geographical subspecies-although he did not call them “races.” The succeeding generation fused Buffon's word with Linnaeus's concept, and thus created the scientific term “race,” used well into the twentieth century. The Linnaean concept of race, however, was a Platonic or essentialist idea-describing not a reality (how organisms are), but a hyper-reality (the imaginary form they represent). Thus, Linnaeus (1758, p. 21) defined “Homo sapiens Europaeus albus”-that is to say, white European Homo sapiens-as having “long flowing blond hair” and “blue eyes” (Pilis flavescentibus prolixis. Oculis caeruleis).",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Anthropology,2010.0

These had a tense relationship with the more mainstream areas of racial anthropology and primate taxonomy. Both produced conclusions that were often difficult to reconcile with traditional physical anthropology but that laid claim to the authoritative voices of genetics and evolution. They were also less relevant and less threatening to general anthropology than the other movement for the application of genetics to anthropological problems-eugenics-had been.

Variables analyzed included straight-line dispersal distance, duration, timing, age, direction, and evidence of natal habitat preference induction of dispersers. We compared these values during a time when the population was increasing (1990-1998) to a period when the numbers had leveled off (1999-2007) and stabilized. We found no difference in average dispersal distance, duration or age between the two periods, and no gender bias in these characteristics. Yearlings/adults dispersed shorter distances (29.5km) than pups (42.5km) from 1999 to 2007 and decreased their dispersal distances during this period. After 1999, dispersals occurred 11months of the year (compared with 7months in 1990-1998), and the peak in pup dispersal timing shifted from December to January. The peak in dispersal timing was also significantly later for pups than yearlings/adults in 1999-2007.

However, the diagnostic utility of the reported outcome measures has rarely been determined. Identifying outcome measures capable of predicting who is less likely to develop CAI could improve rehabilitation protocols and increase the efficiency of these measures. Objective: To determine the diagnostic utility and cutoff scores of perceptual, mechanical, and sensorimotor outcome measures between copers and people with CAI by using receiver operating characteristic curves. Design: Case-control study. Setting: Sports medicine research laboratory. Patients or Other Participants: Twenty-four copers (12 men, 12 women; age = 20.8±1.5 years, height = 173±11 cm, mass = 78±27 kg) and 24 people with CAI (12 men, 12 women; age = 21.7±2.8 years, height = 175±13 cm, mass = 71 ±13 kg) participated. Intervention(s): Self-reported disability questionnaires, radiographic images, and a single-legged hop stabilization test. Main Outcome Measure(s): Perceptual outcomes included scores on the Foot and Ankle Disability Index (FADI), FADI-Sport, and a self-report questionnaire of ankle function. Mechanically, talar position was quantified by measuring the distance from the anterior tibia to the anterior talus in the sagittal plane. Sensorimotor outcomes were the dynamic postural stability index and directional indices, which were calculated during a single-legged hop stabilization task. Results: Perceptual outcomes demonstrated diagnostic accuracy (range, 0.79-0.91), with 95% confidence intervals ranging from 0.65 to 1.00. Sensorimotor outcomes also were able to discriminate between copers and people with CAI but with less accuracy (range, 0.69-0.70), with 95% confidence intervals ranging from 0.37 to 0.86. The mechanical outcome demonstrated poor diagnostic accuracy (0.52). Conclusions: The greatest diagnostic utility scores were achieved by the self-assessed disability questionnaires, which indicated that perceptual outcomes had the greatest ability to accurately predict people who became copers after their initial injuries. However, the diversity of outcome measures that discriminated between copers and people with CAI indicated that the causal mechanism of CAI is probably multifactorial.",CHHS,Kinesiology,2012.0

Yet despite its prominence, it has proven to be quite elusive with regard to its measurement and, hence, making it nearly impossible to test theoretical hypotheses regarding its predictive efficacy. Although the concept, whether derived from Merton's classic conceptualization or from its current incarnation in the form of institutional anomie as developed by Messner and Rosenfeld, is multidimensional and complex in its theoretical structure, most researchers have attempted to operationalize it through simple, single-item, often surrogate/proxy measures. The present research note attempts to develop a measure that is more consistent with its multidimensional and complex nature. This more complex operationalization is then examined with regard to its efficacy at predicting cross-national levels of both homicide and theft.

The idea of these methods are associated with that measuring similarity between visual entities from images can be based on matching the internal layout of Local Self-Similarities.

To combine the powers of the SIFT and LSS (LP), LSS and FLSS are used as the local features in the SIFT algorithm. Secondly, different from the natural LSS (LP) descriptor that chooses the maximal correlation value in each bucket to get photometric translations invariance, the proposed LSS (C) and FLSS (C) adopt distribution-based representation to achieve more robust geometric translations invariance. In the contexts of image matching and object category classification experiments, the LSS (C) and FLSS (C) both outperform the original LSS (LP), and achieve favorably comparable performance to the SIFT.

This study was designed to characterize the cardiopulmonary response to hyperoxia,andto identify candidate susceptibility genes in mice. Electrocardiogram and ventilatory data were recorded continuously from 4 inbred and 29 recombinant inbred strains during 96 hours of hyperoxia (100% oxygen). Genome-wide linkage analysis was performed in 27 recombinant inbred strains against response time indices (TIs) calculated from each cardiac phenotype. Reductions inminute ventilation, heart rate (HR), low-frequency(LF) HR variability (HRV), high-frequency HRV,and total power HRV were found in all mice during hyperoxia exposure, but the lag time before these changes began was strain dependent. Significant (chromosome 9) or suggestive (chromosomes 3 and 5) quantitative trait loci were identified for the HRTI and LFTI. Functional polymorphisms in several candidate susceptibility genes were identified within the quantitative trait loci and were associated with hyperoxia susceptibility. This is the first study to report highly significant interstrain variation in hyperoxia-induced changes in minute ventilation, HR, and HRV, and to identify polymorphisms in candidate susceptibility genes that associate with cardiac responses. Results indicate that changes in HR and LF HRV could be important predictors of subsequent adverse outcome during hyperoxia exposure, specifically the pathogenesis of acute lung injury.

2-s2.0-84859702146,Conference Paper,"In recent years, geographic information has entered the mainstream, deeply altering the pre-existing patterns of its production, distribution, and consumption. Through web mapping, millions of online users utilise spatial data in interactive digital maps. The typical unit of visualisation of geo-data is a viewport, defined as a bi-dimensional image of a map, fixed at a given scale, in a rectangular frame. In a viewport, the user performs analytical tasks, observing individual map features, or drawing high-level judgements about the objects in the viewport as a whole. Current geographic information retrieval (GIR) systems aim at facilitating analytical tasks, and little emphasis is put on the retrieval and indexing of visualised units, i.e. viewports. In this paper we outline a holistic, viewport-based GIR system, offering an alternative approach to feature-based GIR. Such a system indexes viewports, rather than individual map features, extracting descriptors of their high-level, overall semantics in a vector space model. This approach allows for efficient comparison, classification, clustering, and indexing of viewports.

2-s2.0-84859715668,Article,"Few pathogens are the sole or primary cause of species extinctions, but forest disease has caused spectacular declines in North American overstorey trees and restructured forest ecosystems at large spatial scales over the past 100years. These events threaten biodiversity associated with impacted host trees and other resources valued by human societies even when they do not directly cause host extinction. Invasion of Phytophthora ramorum and emergence of the forest disease sudden oak death has caused a large-scale decline of tanoak (Notholithocarpus densiflorus) in Californian coastal forests. Here, we describe structural changes to tanoak forests and develop predictive models of infection rates, mortality rates and changes in tanoak biomass and abundance by combining regionally extensive longitudinal field studies and mathematical modelling. Pathogen-invaded stands had smaller average tanoak tree size and higher proportions of large dead tanoak trees compared with uninvaded stands. This pattern is caused in part by a positive relationship between tanoak size and mortality rate, as well as prolific basal sprouting from trees killed by the disease. Tanoak infection, mortality and biomass decline rates were positively related to the prevalence of infection in sporulation-supporting species, especially California bay laurel (Umbellularia californica). We developed a stage-structured and spatially explicit mathematical model including species dynamics and P. ramorum transmission, where the long-term outcome of disease ranges from host extinction when densities of bay laurel are high to limited or no disease outbreak. Low densities of tanoak in a matrix of non-susceptible neighbouring species resulted in slow-enough transmission to retain overstorey tanoak, suggesting host-density thresholds may exist in real forests. Synthesis. Tanoak is likely to persist in many disease-impacted forests via vegetative reproduction, but overstorey trees may be eliminated or greatly reduced in abundance, a pattern similar to other forest diseases that have emerged in the last century including chestnut blight and beech bark disease. Our results support a general model of disease-caused changes to forest trees useful for the analysis of emerging forest pathogens where vegetative reproduction, community-level epidemiology and stage-specific mortality rate interact to determine local disease intensity and host decline.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2012.0

Design/methodology/approach: Data were obtained from three samples of working adults. The first was a convenience sample recruited by undergraduate students (n=120), the second was a stratified random sample from a metropolitan area in the southern USA (n=126), and the third was an internet-based panel sample (n=402). Constant comparative analysis of responses to open-ended questions was used to investigate the overarching research questions. Findings: It is found that employees enjoy meetings when they have a clear objective, and when important relevant information is shared. Consistent with conservation of resources theory, most employees are unhappy with meetings when they reduce their work-related resources (e.g. meetings constrain their time, lack structure and are unproductive). Practical implications: The data suggest that meetings appear to be both resource-draining and resource-supplying activities in the workplace. Researchers and managers should consider overtly asking about how people feel about meetings, as a means of identifying areas for future research inquiry and targets for improvement in the workplace generally.

2-s2.0-84860299965,Article,"Much work on technological change agrees that the recombination of new and existing technological capabilities is one of the principal sources of technological novelty. Patented inventions can be seen as bundles of distinct technologies brought together to accomplish a specific outcome - and this is how the US Patent Office defines inventions. The technologies constituting inventions are identified by the US Patent Office through an elaborate system of technology codes. A combinatorial perspective on invention, emblematic of approaches to technological change informed by evolutionary economics and complexity science, is inherent in the use of technology codes to summarize what is technologically novel about a patented invention. The technology codes represent a set of consistent definitions of technologies and their components spanning 220 years of inventive activity, and are an underutilized data resource for identifying distinct technological capabilities, defining technology spaces, marking the arrival of technological novelty, measuring technological complexity, and empirically grounding the study of technological change. The present discussion provides an introduction to the use of patent technology codes as well as some basic empirics. Our results highlight the highly discriminating nature of the codes and their usefulness in characterizing the type of processes by which technological capabilities generate novelty.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2012.0

2-s2.0-84860422555,Article,"The Hubbell Spring fault system lies near the eastern margin of the Albuquerque- Belen Basin in the central Rio Grande rift, and it is one of the most active normal faults in the region. Recent mapping and geophysical studies indicate that fault geometry is more complex and longer than previously thought, with several signifi cant, subparallel, anastomosing, west-dipping splays that form a broad zone as wide as 18 km and ∼74 km long. We conducted a paleoseismic investigation of the previously untrenched central Hubbell Spring fault splay (splay L) at the Carrizo Spring site. Our study included mapping, trenching, drilling, and luminescence analyses. We found structural, stratigraphic, and pedologic evidence for the occurrence of at least four, possibly fi ve, large earthquakes that occurred since deposition of piedmont deposits on the Llano de Manzano surface ca. 83.6 ± 6.0 ka. All of these events included warping across a broad deformation zone, whereas the three largest events also included discrete slip across four fault zones. Behavior appears noncharacteristic (i.e., highly variable slip per event), with preferred vertical displacements ranging from 0.4 to 3.7 m. The total down-to-the-west throw of piedmont deposits is 7.3 ± 1.0 m. Luminescence ages indicate that the timing of the four largest surface-deforming events on fault splay L overlaps with the timing of the four youngest faulting events from previous studies of the western Hubbell Spring fault splay (or splay J), suggesting simultaneous rupture of fault splays J and L. Displacement data and correlation of buried soils on event horizons between sites also support simultaneous rupture; however, timing constraints are on the order of thousands of years, and so triggering of events between splays cannot be precluded. The smallest warping event on fault splay L, event Y(?), does not appear to correlate to any events on splay J, suggesting that independent rupture of fault splay L also occasionally occurs. Assuming simultaneous rupture of splay J and L, the average recurrence interval over the past three complete seismic cycles is 19 (+5/-4) k.y., consistent with recurrence intervals estimated for individual cycles, which are 17 k.y., 27 k.y., and 14 k.y. We estimate an average vertical slip rate for the past four complete seismic cycles on splays J and L of ∼0.2 mm/yr. In comparison, recent average late Quaternary slip rate estimates for the entire Hubbell Spring fault system range between 0.2 and 1.0 mm/yr, based on topographic profi les transecting all the splays. Slip rates for individual complete seismic cycles for splays L and J vary through time by an order of magnitude, ranging from 0.044 mm/yr to 0.46 mm/yr. This is not due to temporal clustering of earthquakes but instead is primarily due to large variations in slip per event, a fi nding that may have signifi cant implications for seismic hazards elsewhere in the Rio Grande rift. Additional investigations are needed to determine the paleoseismic behavior of the many other splays of the Hubbell Spring fault system and better characterize this complex fault system for seismic hazard evaluations in the Albuquerque region.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2011.0

Conservation of resources theory suggests such experiences should induce strain and decreased work satisfaction; social identity theory suggests such work should lead to strong psychological investment in the work, among other outcomes. Integrating these two perspectives, this study hypothesizes and presents quantitative evidence from 499 animal-shelter workers, demonstrating how dirty-work engagement relates to higher levels of strain, job involvement, and reluctance to discuss work while negatively influencing work satisfaction. Additionally, this study takes a unique perspective on dirty work by focusing on dirty tasks within a dirty-work occupation.

The analysis included instrumental variables methodology to account for simultaneity in the charitable giving-profits relationship. Data were gathered from the IRS Corporate Statistics of Income Sourcebook, data that provide firm size class measures covering the entire firm size distribution ranging from small retailers up to large multi-national retail firms.

Important findings include a cubic relationship between retailer philanthropy and firm size; industry effects stronger than those observed for retail profit; and the absence of business cycle effects. The empirical research relating retail charitable giving to firm attributes including firm size and advertising, industry and business cycle factors are unique in the business ethics literature. Prior studies regarding the importance of industry on charitable giving utilized data across broad sectors of the economy.

These efforts align well with the values and principles (e. g., empowerment, collaboration, strengths emphasis, focus on macro-level social/system change) central to community psychology (CP; Kloos et al. in Community psychology, Cengage Learning, Belmont, 2012). Despite the convergence of many core values, CPs have historically been underrepresented in key roles in SOC initiatives. However, this has changed in recent years, with increasing examples of community psychology skills and principles applied to the development, implementation, and evaluation of SOCs. Because successful and sustainable implementation of SOCs requires community and system-level change, and SOCs are increasingly being urged to adopt a stronger ""public health"" orientation (Miles et al. in A public health approach to children's mental health: a conceptual framework, Georgetown University Center for Child and Human Development, National Technical Assistance Center for Children's Mental Health, Washington, DC, 2010), there is great potential for CPs to play important roles in SOCs.

Developmental research and ""practice-based evidence"" suggest that there are differences between transitioning youth and their younger peers in family environment and wraparound team processes. Although these differences are thought to have significant implications for wraparound practice, few studies have examined them empirically. The present research involves two studies examining differences across several age cohorts (i. e., 10-12, 13, 14, 15, 16-17 year-olds) ranging from early adolescent to transitioning youth in: (1) caregiver perceptions of role-related strain and family environment quality, and (2) facilitator, caregiver, and youth perceptions of wraparound processes. In Study #1, older age was associated with higher levels of caregiver strain. In Study #2, age was associated with differences between youth and other team members' perceptions of wraparound processes, such that older youth perceived teams as less cohesive than others on their teams.

There is a need for software vendors to make software patches available in a timely manner for vulnerabilities in their products. We develop a survival analysis model of software vendors' patch release behavior and test it using a data set compiled from the National Vulnerability Database, United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team, and vendor Web sites. This model helps to understand how factors specific to vulnerabilities, patches, software vendors, and software affect the patch release behavior of software vendors based on their cost structure. This study also analyzes the impact of the presence of multiple vendors and type of vendor on the patch release behavior of software vendors. Our results indicate that vulnerabilities with high confidentiality impact or high integrity impact are patched faster than vulnerabilities with high availability impact. Interesting differences in the patch release behavior of software vendors based on software type (new release versus update) and type of vendor (open source versus proprietary) are found. Our results illustrate that when there are legislative pressures, vendors react faster in patching vulnerabilities.

How to estimate AADT and VMT on local area roads is a long-time existing problem due to lack of traffic monitor counts. This paper presents a novel approach to the community area AADT and VMT estimation by developing circuit network model and simulation to solve this difficult problem for community local traffic network roads. The circuit network model is developed based on the community traffic network, and has three sub-models combined by the least squares method (LSM). These sub-models respectively represent even, local and separate distributions of the entrance traffic flows among households in a community. The method is well validated by sampled measurement data and circuit network simulation results. In addition, it is discovered that the total entrance traffic amount is strongly related to the total number of households in communities. Thus, it makes the new method feasible to estimate the AADT and VMT on community local area roads even without any measurement in future. The proposed method not only can provide accurate estimate, but also can dramatically reduce the labor load and cost of traffic counts.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2011.0

Today, there are over 900 such designations bestowed upon national treasures from every corner of the globe, which are believed to have "" outstanding universal value"" for humanity. At the heart of this world heritage movement is the belief that certain natural and cultural wonders are the collective property and responsibility of all humanity, despite having vastly different historical and geographical origins.

To address this lacuna, we chart the rise of this phenomenon over the past century and a half utilizing a variety of empirical information and explain how key patterns of development reflect fundamental globalization processes-such as the expansion of an interconnected world polity, the diffusion of highly universalistic conceptions of humanity, and the valorization of rationalized techniques as the primary means of human progress.

Specifically, two dynamical metrics are tracked. Changes in flexibility index quantify differences within backbone flexibility, whereas changes in the cooperativity correlation quantify differences within pairwise mechanical couplings. Regardless of metric, the same general conclusions are drawn. That is, small structural perturbations introduced by single point mutations have a frequent and pronounced affect on lysozyme flexibility that can extend over long distances. Specifically, an appreciable change occurs in backbone flexibility for 48% of the residues, and a change in cooperativity occurs in 42% of residue pairs. The average distance from mutation to a site with a change in flexibility is 17-20 Å. Interestingly, the frequency and scale of the changes within single point mutant structures are generally larger than those observed in the hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) ortholog, which shares 61% sequence identity with human lysozyme. For example, point mutations often lead to substantial flexibility increases within the β-subdomain, which is consistent with experimental results indicating that it is the nucleation site for amyloid formation. However, β-subdomain flexibility within the human and HEWL orthologs is more similar despite the lowered sequence identity.

Plots from the PLS-DA model visualized a distinct separation in global metabolic scores between time points [R2Y(cum) = 0.869, Q2(cum) = 0.766]. Of the top 15 metabolites, five were related to liver glutathione production, eight to carbohydrate, lipid, and amino acid metabolism, and two were tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates. BAN and CHO ingestion during 75-km cycling resulted in similar performance, blood glucose, inflammation, oxidative stress, and innate immune levels. Aside from higher dopamine in BAN, shifts in metabolites following BAN and CHO 75-km cycling time trials indicated a similar pattern of heightened production of glutathione and utilization of fuel substrates in several pathways.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2012.0
2-s2.0-84861218951,Article,"We provide a direct test of the extent to which the stringency of a Tax and Expenditure Limit (TEL) influences the creation of special district governments by examining one of the strictest TELs in U.S. history, the Colorado Taxpayer's Bill of Rights (TABOR). Through analysis of panel data from 1993 to 2004 of general purpose and special district governments, we test the relationship between TABOR and the creation of special districts. The novelty of our research involves the use of successful and failed attempts to override TABOR to measure variation in TEL restrictiveness at the county and municipal geography. Our results indicate that counties and municipalities unable to override TABOR's restrictions and therefore bound by the TEL have no greater use of special district governments than local jurisdictions experiencing similar demand for services but not bound by TABOR. These results are robust to failed override attempts specific to tax revenue as well as debt proceeds. Furthermore, results are unaffected by the use of multiyear lagged measures of override attempts and the inclusion of county debrucing initiatives that passed or failed by a small margin-i.e., less than 60 percent of votes. Contrary to anecdotal evidence, our results find no relationship between tax and expenditure limits and the formation of special districts.",Business,Economics,2012.0
2-s2.0-84861227041,Article,"Purpose: This review focuses and aids the development of organizational support theory, which explains relationships between employers and employees based on social exchange. Many studies have explored the theory's central construct, perceived organizational support (POS), or the degree to which employees believe their work organization values their contributions and cares about their well-being. Since the last review of POS literature in 2000, the occupational landscape has shifted, increasing nontraditional work relationships and the importance of managing an international workforce while considering influences on employee well-being. This review discusses how the recent POS research reflects these trends. Design/Methodology/Approach: This review focused on how themes in the POS research since 2000 have enhanced organizational support theory as relevant to the twenty-first century world of work. Findings: Four important theoretical themes have developed since 2000 that enhance organizational support theory: considerations of employee well-being, nontraditional workers, international and cross-cultural issues, and developments tied to the use of multilevel modeling. Implications: Giving both researchers and practitioners a synthesized view of the current status of POS research, this review serves as a springboard for new developments. It also integrates the multitude of recent studies into organizational support theory, focusing theoretical progress. Originality/Value: This is the first review and theoretical integration of the POS literature since 2002. It is a valuable resource for all interested in the field, with theoretical insights, useful tables, explanatory figures, and references.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Organizational Science,2012.0
2-s2.0-84861332081,Article,"After the destruction of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform during the spring of 2010, the northern Gulf of Mexico was threatened by an oil spill from the Macondo well. Emergency responders were concerned about oil transport in the nearshore, where it threatened immediately the fishing waters and coastline from Louisiana to Florida. In this region, oil movement was influenced by a continental shelf with varying width, the protruding Mississippi River delta, the marshes and bayou of southern Louisiana, and the shallow sounds and barrier islands that protect the coastline. Transport forecasts require physics-based computational models and high-resolution meshes that represent the circulation in deep water, on the continental shelf, and within the complex nearshore environment.This work applies the coupled SWAN+ADCIRC model on a high-resolution computational mesh to simulate the current velocity field on the continental shelf, nearshore and marsh areas during the time that oil was visible on the surface of the Gulf. The SWAN+ADCIRC simulations account for the influence of tides, riverine discharge, winds and wind-driven waves. A highly efficient Lagrangian particle transport model is employed to simulate the surface trajectories of the oil. The transport model accounts for dispersion and advection by wind and currents. Transport is evaluated using 2-week long sequences of satellite images. During both periods, the SWAN+ADCIRC current fields alone appeared to be more successful moving the oil than when direct wind forcing was included. In addition, hypothetical oil transport is considered during two hurricane scenarios. Had a hurricane significantly impacted the northern Gulf while the spill was active, depending on the track of the storm relative to the spill location, oil would have moved farther into the marshes of southern Louisiana or farther along the shelf toward Texas than actually occurred during the spill.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2012.0

The Gram-negative bacterium Vibrio vulnificus is a ubiquitous inhabitant of estuarine waters, and is the number one cause of seafood-related deaths in the US. Many V. vulnificus isolates have been studied, and it has been shown that two genetically distinct subtypes, distinguished by 16S rDNA and other gene polymorphisms, are associated predominantly with either environmental or clinical isolation. While local genetic differences between the subtypes have been probed, only the genomes of clinical isolates have so far been completely sequenced. In order to better understand V. vulnificus as an agent of disease and to identify the molecular components of its virulence mechanisms, we have completed whole genome shotgun sequencing of three diverse environmental genotypes using a pyrosequencing approach. V. vulnificus strain JY1305 was sequenced to a depth of 33×, and strains E64MW and JY1701 were sequenced to lesser depth, covering approximately 99.9% of each genome. We have performed a comparative analysis of these sequences against the previously published sequences of three V. vulnificus clinical isolates. We find that the genome of V. vulnificus is dynamic, with 1.27% of genes in the C-genotype genomes not found in the E- genotype genomes. We identified key genes that differentiate between the genomes of the clinical and environmental genotypes. 167 genes were found to be specifically associated with environmental genotypes and 278 genes with clinical genotypes. Genes specific to the clinical strains include components of sialic acid catabolism, mannitol fermentation, and a component of a Type IV secretory pathway VirB4, as well as several other genes with potential significance for human virulence. Genes specific to environmental strains included several that may have implications for the balance between self-preservation under stress and nutritional competence.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2012.0

Human users in Personalized Network Spaces (PNetS), pervasive computing environments connected by opportunistic peer-to-peer connections, need information that is immediate and localized. This tight integration of the user with his immediate surroundings introduces novel search requirements. The requisite support for performing search of the here and now in the here and now calls for a new paradigm of search that explicitly separates search from advanced indexing of data. In light of this vision, this paper presents Gander, a scalable search engine for PNetS, along with myGander, a prototype mobile interface for Gander. The utility and usability of myGander as supported by Gander is demonstrated through a practical real-world pervasive computing scenario.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2012.0

In this vision, information is ephemeral: it is created, moved, stored, and deleted on-demand at rapid rates. Without a formal data model that enables the data itself to speak about its spatial and temporal bearings, it is difficult to build support for accessing an information-rich digital world in a general-purpose way. In this paper, we demonstrate the need for an expressive data model of the inherently ephemeral data in pervasive computing and propose the beginnings of such a model that explicitly tags information with spatial and temporal semantics. Our model is founded on spatiotemporal trajectories, which capture the spatial and temporal semantics of data and the phenomenon it represents. We further demonstrate both the need for and potential impact of a general-purpose expressive spatiotemporal data model using several use cases.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2012.0

These components are interconnected through different communication media, protocols, and secure tunnels, and they are operated using different data delivery modes and security policies. The inherent complexity and heterogeneity in AMI significantly increase the potential of security threats due to misconfiguration or absence of defense, which may cause devastating damage to AMI. Therefore, there is a need of creating a formal model that can represent the global behavior of AMI configuration in order to verify the potential threats. In this paper, we present SmartAnalyzer, a formal security analysis tool, which offers manifold contributions: (i) formal modeling of AMI configuration including device configurations, topology, communication properties, interactions between the devices, data flows, and security properties; (ii) formal modeling of AMI invariant and user-driven constraints based on the interdependencies between AMI device configurations, security properties, and security control guidelines; (iii) verifying the AMI configuration's compliances with security constraints using Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solver; (iv) generating a comprehensive security threat report with possible remediation plan based on the verification results.

2-s2.0-84861601388,Conference Paper,"Location privacy has been a serious concern for mobile users who use location-based services provided by the third-party provider via mobile networks. Recently, there have been tremendous efforts on developing new anonymity or obfuscation techniques to protect location privacy of mobile users. Though effective in certain scenarios, these existing techniques usually assume that a user has a constant privacy requirement along spatial and/or temporal dimensions, which may not be true in real-life scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a new location privacy problem: Location-aware Location Privacy Protection (L2P2) problem, where users can define dynamic and diverse privacy requirements for different locations. The goal of the L2P2 problem is to find the smallest cloaking area for each location request so that diverse privacy requirements over spatial and/or temporal dimensions are satisfied for each user. In this paper, we formalize two versions of the L2P2 problem, and propose several efficient heuristics to provide such location-aware location privacy protection for mobile users. Through multiple simulations on a large data set of trajectories for one thousand mobile users, we confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed L2P2 algorithms.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2012.0

2-s2.0-84861712850,Article,"With the recent popularization of mobile video cameras including camera phones, a new technology, mobile video surveillance, which uses mobile video cameras for video surveillance has been emerging. Such videos, however, may infringe upon the privacy of others by disclosing privacy sensitive information (PSI), i.e., their appearances. To prevent videos from infringing on the right to privacy, new techniques are required that automatically obscure PSI regions. The problem is how to determine the PSI regions to be obscured while maintaining enough video content to present the camera persons' capture-intentions, i.e., what they want to record in their videos to achieve their surveillance tasks. To this end, we introduce a new concept called intended human objects that are defined as human objects essential for capture-intentions, and develop a new method called intended human object detection that automatically detects the intended human objects in videos taken by different camera persons. Through the process of intended human object detection, we develop a system for automatically obscuring PSI regions.

We proposed that unique relations in members' perceptions of group members, perceptual relationships specific to particular dyads within a focal group, would be a source of negativity within teams' outcomes. Participants were undergraduates who worked in small groups for assignments for the duration of one semester; each member rated themselves and their teammates on five individual-level characteristics.

Specifically, the study explores the relationships among employees' perceptions and reported behaviors with regard to such meetings. Respondents are 291 adults working in different organizations. Structural equation modeling of the data largely supports the hypothesized model. Employee perceptions of relationship quality with their supervisors (leader-member exchange) fully mediates the relationship between perceptions of supervisors' fairness (interactional justice) in group meetings and perceived organizational support. Leader-member exchange also fully mediates the relationship between interactional justice perceptions and meeting citizenship behaviors-a new construct describing extra-role behaviors that support meeting processes-and between good meeting practices by the supervisors and meeting citizenship behaviors. Leader-member exchange partially mediates the relationship between good meeting practices and perceived organizational support.

However, little is yet known concerning their bioactive forms in vivo and the mechanisms by which they may alter our metabolome, which ultimately contribute toward disease prevention. Here we report a study to determine the metabolic fate of polyphenolic components in a Chinese tea (Pu-erh) in human subjects using a metabonomic profiling approach coupled with multivariate and univariate statistical analysis. Urine samples were collected at 0 h, 1 h, 3 h, 6 h, 9 h, 12 h, and 24 h within the first 24 h and once a day during a 6 week period including a 2 week baseline phase, a 2 week daily Pu-erh tea ingestion phase, and a 2 week ""wash-out"" phase, and they were analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. The dynamic concentration profile of bioavailable plant molecules (due to in vivo absorption and the hepatic and gut bacterial metabolism) and the human metabolic response profile were measured and correlated with each other.

In this work we introduced the E442A mutation, which abrogates a salt-bridge between switch I and switch II, and the G440A mutation, which abolishes a main-chain hydrogen bond associated with the interaction of switch II with the γ phosphate of ATP, into myosin V. We used fluorescence resonance energy transfer between mant-labeled nucleotides or IAEDANS-labeled actin and FlAsH-labeled myosin V to examine the conformation of the nucleotide- and actin-binding regions, respectively. We demonstrate that in the absence of actin, both the G440A and E442A mutants bind ATP with similar affinity and result in only minor alterations in the conformation of the nucleotide-binding pocket (NBP). In the presence of ADP and actin, both switch II mutants disrupt the formation of a closed NBP actomyosin.ADP state. The G440A mutant also prevents ATP-induced opening of the actin-binding cleft. Our results indicate that the switch II region is critical for stabilizing the closed NBP conformation in the presence of actin, and is essential for communication between the active site and actin-binding region.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2012.0

A sample selection of women who experienced physical (n = 4,308), sexual (n = 4,309), and emotional violence (n = 4,312) aged 15 to 49 allowed for the estimation of the association between education and domestic violence with further analysis stratified by urban and rural residence. The main outcome of interest was a three-factor (physical, sexual, and emotional) measure for violence with the main predictor being education. Nearly half of all domestic violence, physical (46%), sexual (45%), and emotional (45%) occurred among women aged 15 to 29. After adjusting for confounding variables, women who resided in urban areas and had a postprimary/vocational/secondary and college/university education were 26% (OR = 0.74, 95% CI: [0.64, 0.86]), p <.001 and 22% (OR = 0.78, 95% CI: [0.66, 0.92]), p <.01 less likely to have experienced physical violence compared to those who had a primary education respectively.

2-s2.0-84861986367,Article,"Previous research on physical layer network coding (PNC) focuses on the improvements in bandwidth usage efficiency. Its capability to assist wireless nodes in localization was first discussed in [1]. In that paper, however, the authors discussed only the basic idea to detect and separate the interfered signals for calculating the node positions. Many important issues to turn the idea into a practical approach are not extensively studied. In this paper, we plan to investigate these problems. Specifically, our research focuses on the bootstrap procedures, security, and localization accuracy of the PNC based mechanism. We first study the required node density to bootstrap the localization procedure in both infrastructure-based and self-organized networks. With this question answered, researchers can recognize the network scenarios to which PNC based localization can be applied. We design mechanisms to protect integrity of the exchanged information and defend against node impersonation attacks so that the localization procedures will be robust against malicious activities. For localization accuracy, we study the negative impacts of the position errors of the anchor nodes. We design two mechanisms to reduce the localization inaccuracy for both individual nodes and cumulative procedures through excluding the anchor nodes with positioning errors and introducing multiple bootstrap areas. Both simulation and theoretical analysis are used to support our investigation. This research shows that PNC based node localization can satisfy the security and accuracy requirements of different types of wireless networks and it can be widely deployed.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2012.0

Newly added firms experience a significant decline in the cost of equity, while recently removed firms show a significant increase. Liquidity improves for addition firms and declines for removed firms. Addition firms also experience a decline in shadow cost. Changes in cost of equity for included firms are explained by changes in liquidity, shadow cost, and firm size.

A compelling explanation for this dichotomy is that users are struggling against their SNS environment in an effort to achieve their preferred levels of privacy for regulating social interactions. Our research investigates users' SNS boundary regulation behavior. This paper presents results from a qualitative interview-based study to identify ""coping mechanisms"" that users devise outside explicit boundary-regulation interface features in order to manage interpersonal boundaries.

The intention here is to propose for consideration a name modification for an existing field and provide some reflections regarding its evolution, theory, and method. In keeping with the rise of interdisciplines in other ""studies"" programs, business language's empirically definable domain of inquiry, pedagogy, and curriculum development should more appropriately be known as Business Language Studies (BLS). Further consideration of intrinsic theory is strongly encouraged to complement the extensive work already done in extrinsic and applied BLS, given that the development of methods and methodology has far outstripped theoretical considerations per se, the latter of which are now warranted to anchor the field more adequately in U.S. higher education.

2-s2.0-84862110454,Conference Paper,"Peer-to-peer (P2P) network is an important information sharing architecture. The original design of P2P networks assumes peers in the networks altruistically contribute their resources to others. However, most peers are unwilling to cooperate with each other without incentives and it leads to a so called ""free-riding"" behavior. Issues such as ""hotspot"" and ""tragedy of the digital commons"" are coming along with serious free-riding problems. Eventually, the prevalence of free riders will downgrade the performance of entire system and make it vulnerable. One way to encourage resource sharing is through service differentiation based on peer's contributions to the communities. This paper presents two reputation systems for P2P networks. One of them uses fuzzy logic method which uses requester's reputation and provider's inbound bandwidth as input information to create incentives for sharing and to avoid over-loading problems for primary file providers. The other one utilizes the clustering effect of virtual communities for reputation management. Reputation sharing in systems is implemented by decentralized selective polling which determines a peers global contribution. The use of selective polling can significantly decrease overheads for reputation sharing. I illustrate the structures and algorithms for these two methods separately and I try to compare system performances for both methods.",Business,BISOM,2012.0

The body sites with the greatest number of core OTUs, defined as OTUs shared amongst 95% or more of the individuals, were the oral sites (saliva, tongue, cheek, gums, and throat) followed by the nose, stool, and skin, while the vaginal sites had the fewest number of OTUs shared across subjects. We found that commonalities between samples based on taxonomy could sometimes belie variability at the sub-genus OTU level. This was particularly apparent in the mouth where a given genus can be present in many different oral sites, but the sub-genus OTUs show very distinct site selection, and in the vaginal sites, which are consistently dominated by the Lactobacillus genus but have distinctly different sub-genus V1-V3 OTU populations across subjects. Different body sites show approximately a ten-fold difference in estimated microbial richness, with stool samples having the highest estimated richness, followed by the mouth, throat and gums, then by the skin, nasal and vaginal sites. Richness as measured by the V1-V3 primers was consistently higher than richness measured by V3-V5. We also show that when such a large cohort is analyzed at the genus level, most subjects fit the stool ""enterotype"" profile, but other subjects are intermediate, blurring the distinction between the enterotypes. When analyzed at the finer-scale, OTU level, there was little or no segregation into stool enterotypes, but in the vagina distinct biotypes were apparent. Finally, we note that even OTUs present in nearly every subject, or that dominate in some samples, showed orders of magnitude variation in relative abundance emphasizing the highly variable nature across individuals.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2012.0
2-s2.0-84862182547,Article,"Background: Chronic ankle instability is a common occurrence after an ankle sprain. Yet, some people (copers) possess a mechanism that limits recurrent injury and disability. During gait termination, those with chronic ankle instability exhibit altered feed-forward and feedback control but little is known about alterations in copers. Therefore, the purpose of this investigation was to determine the biomechanical control alterations present in controls, copers, and those with chronic ankle instability during planned and unplanned gait termination. Methods: Twenty subjects with chronic ankle instability, 20 copers, and 20 uninjured controls completed planned and unplanned gait termination tasks. Unplanned gait termination required subjects to stop, when cued, during randomly selected trials. Planned gait termination required intended stopping. A total of 10 trials were recorded for each condition. Normalized propulsive and braking force magnitudes and dynamic postural stability indices were calculated and compared among the groups. Findings: Normalized maximum braking forces were significantly higher in the chronic ankle instability group (Mean: 2.82 SD: 0.93 N/kg), relative to copers (Mean: 2.59 SD: 0.84 N/kg) and controls (Mean: 2.51 SD: 0.78 N/kg). Similarly, the antero-posterior postural stability index revealed higher scores in the chronic ankle instability group (Mean: 0.15 SD: 0.03) compared to the coper (Mean: 0.14 SD: 0.02) and control group (Mean: 0.14 SD: 0.02).

2-s2.0-84862284420,Article,"Efficient data delivery in vehicular sensor networks is still a challenging research issue. Position-based routing protocols have been proven to be more suitable for dynamic vehicular networks or large-scale mobile sensor networks than traditional ad hoc routing protocols. However, position-based routing assumes that intermediate nodes can always be found to set up an end-to-end connection between the source and the destination; otherwise, it suffers from network partitions which are very common in vehicular networks and leads to poor performances. This paper addresses data delivery challenge in the possible intermittently connected vehicular sensor networks by combining position-based forwarding strategy with store-carry-forward routing scheme from delay tolerant networks. The proposed routing method makes use of vehicle driving direction to determine whether holding or forwarding the packet.

Hence, knowledge management (KM) has been extensively researched. Prior knowledge management research has recognized the importance of making individual knowledge available throughout the organization. Most KM research, however, has thus far focused on a technology-based KM strategy with relatively little discussion on how knowledge can be effectively shared using organizational social relationships. This paper focuses on how knowledge-intensive organizations can design and use knowledge flow networks (KFNs) in order to facilitate knowledge sharing. Designing and using KFNs to maximize knowledge sharing is a complex problem. We formulate a mixed integer programming model (MIP), and present a heuristic in order to facilitate systematic analysis and understanding of effective KFNs. We consider organizations that support multiple skills and have workers with varying levels of competence who are connected through IT-facilitated organizational social relationships. Our results, based on computational experiments, provide several interesting insights and intelligence into the design of an effective KFN. First, our results highlight that average workers play a vital bridging role in knowledge sharing. Second, social networking concepts of ties and cohesiveness are used to better understand the dynamics of knowledge sharing. The importance of indirect relationships between expert workers and the network effects due to indirect relationships are illustrated. For effective KM, we also illustrate how organizations can reduce the total number of ties required in a multi-skill environment. In our model extensions, we study the impact of worker turnover and knowledge depreciation on the design and use of effective KFNs. Managerial implications of these results are discussed.

The purpose of this study was to examine core case management practices and processes for engaging high-risk girls in Prime Time, an intensive multi-component intervention from the perspectives of intervention program staff. Method: Structured individual interviews were conducted with the entire Prime Time program staff (N = 7) to assess successes and challenges in engaging adolescent girls at high risk for early pregnancy. The girls were recruited from school and community clinics. Results: Program staff described different capacities of adolescents to engage with the program (those who connected easily, those in the middle range of connecting, and those who had difficulty connecting) and provided specific recommendations for working with the different types of connectors. Discussion: Findings from this study support the supposition that persons engaging in preventive interventions with vulnerable groups of adolescents must pay careful attention to strategies for establishing trusting youth-adult relationships.

Methods: A group of 998 adults (age 18-85 yr) was measured for neurocognitive function using a computerized neuropsychological test from CNS Vital Signs (Morrisville, NC). They also completed the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), which measures psychopathology, as well as the World Health Organization QOL questionnaire and the Perceived Stress Scale. General linear modeling was used to examine relationships between exercise frequency and neurocognitive function, BSI, QOL, and the Perceived Stress Scale. Backward selection in the GLMSELECT procedure in SAS (version 9.1.3; SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) was used to identify confounding variables including age, gender, body mass index, marital status, education level, stress level, alcohol, smoking, and chronic disease. A contrast to test linear trend was performed after adjusting for confounders. Pairwise comparisons were performed across exercise frequency tertiles using the Tukey-Kramer method. Results: P values for trend tests and pairwise comparisons were nonsignificant for all five cognition function domains across exercise frequency tertiles after adjustment for confounders. Age and education level emerged as the best correlates of neurocognitive function. P values for trend were significant for all BSI domains and indices, QOL, and perceived stress, across exercise frequency tertiles.

Therefore, for decision-making, planners need to know the specific land demands under different scenarios and their spatio-temporal dynamics. However, it is not easy to obtain the above knowledge due to the complex and dynamic characteristics of the land use system and the limitations of current models in taking both the temporal and spatial driving factors into consideration. To address these issues, this study coupled the system dynamics model (SD) and the model for the conversion of land use and its effects at small regional extent (CLUE-S) to simulate the land-use change in Changqing District, Jinan, China. The objectives are: (1) to develop the SD model to simulate the land-use demands on a macro-scale as a whole for the period 1997-2005, (2) to improve the presentation of the land use change processes based on the CLUE-S model that will transfer and allocate land demands from the SD model to spatially explicit land use patterns, and (3) to discuss the local land-use dynamics. Our results show that the coupled model could provide information on the specific local land use demands under different developing scenarios, the dynamics of their spatio-temporal changes, and the growth and decline of urban land and farm land.

2-s2.0-84862909978,Conference Paper,"Three dimensional (3D) wireless sensor networks have attracted a lot of attention due to its great potential usages in both commercial and civilian applications. Topology control in 3D sensor networks has been studied recently. Different 3D geometric topologies were proposed to be the underlying network topologies to achieve the sparseness of the communication networks. However, most of the proposed 3D topologies cannot bound the node degree, i.e., some nodes may need to maintain large number of neighbors in the constructed topologies, which is not energy efficient and may lead to large interference. In this paper, we extend several existing 3D topologies to a set of new 3D topologies with bounded node degree. We provide theoretical analysis on their power efficiency and node degree and also simulation evaluations over random 3D sensor networks. The simulation results confirm nice performance of these proposed 3D topologies.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2011.0

2-s2.0-84862939644,Conference Paper,"A perennially interesting research topic in the field of visual analytics is how to effectively develop systems that support organizational users' decision-making and reasoning processes. The problem is, however, most domain analytical practices generally vary from organization to organization. This leads to diverse designs of visual analytics systems in incorporating domain analytical processes, making it difficult to generalize the success from one domain to another. Exacerbating this problem is the dearth of general models of analytical workflows available to enable such timely and effective designs. To alleviate these problems, we present a two-stage framework for informing the design of a visual analytics system. This design framework builds upon and extends current practices pertaining to analytical workflow and focuses, in particular, on incorporating both general domain analysis processes as well as individual's analytical activities. We illustrate both stages and their design components through examples, and hope this framework will be useful for designing future visual analytics systems. We validate the soundness of our framework with two visual analytics systems, namely Entity Workspace [8] and PatViz [37].",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2011.0

The aim of this study was to examine HCL as a proxy for occupational physical activity (PA) among farm residents. The secondary objective was to evaluate PA based on HCL. Methods: Data from 21,296 farmers and 30,951 spouses in the Agricultural Health Study examined the relationship between HCL and farm activities and individual/farm characteristics. HCL was categorized as = 1 or < 1 hours per day. The association between HCL and farm activities (15 for farmers; 16 for spouses) and individual/farm characteristics was examined using adjusted logistic regression. To evaluate PA, we created a PA activity index using metabolic equivalents for HCL, and compared PA weekly averages with national guidelines. Results: In adjusted results, most farm activities were significantly associated with HCL. Based on HCL, farmers had a median of 1.5 hours and spouses 0.5 hours of vigorous or muscle-strengthening PA per day. Most farmers (94%) and about 60% of spouses meet or exceed 2008 national guidelines for vigorous or muscle-strengthening PA. Conclusion: Findings suggest the HCL measure may be useful as a PA metric in future studies of occupational PA among farm residents.",CHHS,Public Health,2012.0
2-s2.0-84862952774,Conference Paper,"Firewalls are the most deployed security devices in computer networks. Nevertheless, designing and configuring distributed firewalls, which include determining access control rules and device placement in the network, is still a significantly complex task as it requires balancing between connectivity requirements and the inherent risk and cost. Formal approaches that allow for investigating distributed firewall configuration space systematically are highly needed to optimize decision support under multiple design constraints. The objective of this paper is to automatically synthesize the implementation of distributed filtering architecture and configuration that will minimize security risk while considering connectivity requirements, user usability and budget constraints. Our automatic synthesis generates not only the complete rule configuration for each firewall to satisfy risk and connectivity constraints, but also the optimal firewall placement in the networks to minimizes spurious traffic. We define fine-grain risk, usability and cost metrics tunable to match business requirements, and formalize the configuration synthesis as an optimization problem. We then show that distributed firewall synthesis is an NP-hard problem and provide heuristic approximation algorithms. We implemented our approach in a tool called FireBlanket that were rigorously evaluated under different network sizes, topologies and budget requirements. Our evaluation study shows that the results obtained by FireBlanket are close to the theoretical lower bound and the performance is scalable with the network size.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2011.0

It is an essential step for many subsequent penetration attempts and attacks. Traditional OS fingerprinting depends on banner grabbing schemes or network traffic analysis results to identify the system. These interactive procedures can be detected by intrusion detection systems (IDS) or fooled by fake network packets. In this paper, we propose a new OS fingerprinting mechanism in virtual machine hypervisors that adopt the memory de-duplication technique. Specifically, when multiple memory pages with the same contents occupy only one physical page, their reading and writing access delay will demonstrate some special properties. We use the accumulated access delay to the memory pages that are unique to some specific OS images to derive out whether or not our VM instance and the target VM are using the same OS. The experiment results on VMware ESXi hypervisor with both Windows and Ubuntu Linux OS images show the practicability of the attack.

We demonstrate that automatic extraction of user frustration is possible given action-level visualization interaction logs. An experiment is described which collects data that accurately reflects user emotion transitions and corresponding interaction sequences. This data is then used in building HiddenMarkov Models (HMMs) which statistically connect interaction events with frustration. The capabilities of HMMs in predicting user frustration are tested using standard machine learning evaluation methods. The resulting classifer serves as a suitable predictor of user frustration that performs similarly across different users and datasets.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2011.0

The effectiveness of the our approach is validated against anon-redundant set of 75 protein-DNA complexes, and the results demonstrate improved performance in finding near-native protein-DNA complex structures.

2-s2.0-84862974160,Conference Paper,"Scalable and effective analysis of large text corpora remains a challenging problem as our ability to collect textual data continues to increase at an exponential rate. To help users make sense of large text corpora, we present a novel visual analytics system, Parallel-Topics, which integrates a state-of-the-art probabilistic topic model Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) with interactive visualization. To describe a corpus of documents, ParallelTopics first extracts a set of semantically meaningful topics using LDA. Unlike most traditional clustering techniques in which a document is assigned to a specific cluster, the LDA model accounts for different topical aspects of each individual document. This permits effective full text analysis of larger documents that may contain multiple topics. To highlight this property of the model, ParallelTopics utilizes the parallel coordinate metaphor to present the probabilistic distribution of a document across topics. Such representation allows the users to discover single-topic vs. multi-topic documents and the relative importance of each topic to a document of interest. In addition, since most text corpora are inherently temporal, ParallelTopics also depicts the topic evolution over time. We have applied ParallelTopics to exploring and analyzing several text corpora, including the scientific proposals awarded by the National Science Foundation and the publications in the VAST community over the years. To demonstrate the efficacy of ParallelTopics, we conducted several expert evaluations, the results of which are reported in this paper.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2011.0

2-s2.0-84863042274,Conference Paper,"In this paper, each image is viewed as a bag of local regions, as well as it is investigated globally. A novel method is developed for achieving multi-label multi-instance image annotation, where image-level (bag-level) labels and region-level (instance-level) labels are both obtained. The associations between semantic concepts and visual features are mined both at the image level and at the region level. Inter-label correlations are captured by a co-occurence matrix of concept pairs. The cross-level label coherence encodes the consistency between the labels at the image level and the labels at the region level. The associations between visual features and semantic concepts, the correlations among the multiple labels, and the cross-level label coherence are sufficiently leveraged to improve annotation performance. Structural max-margin technique is used to formulate the proposed model and multiple interrelated classifiers are learned jointly. To leverage the available image-level labeled samples for the model training, the region-level label identification on the training set is firstly accomplished by building the correspondences between the multiple bag-level labels and the image regions. JEC distance based kernels are employed to measure the similarities both between images and between regions.

2-s2.0-84863155751,Article,"Previous works have demonstrated that protein rigidity is related to thermodynamic stability, especially under conditions that favor formation of native structure. Mechanical network rigidity properties of a single conformation are efficiently calculated using the integer body-bar Pebble Game (PG) algorithm. However, thermodynamic properties require averaging over many samples from the ensemble of accessible conformations to accurately account for fluctuations in network topology. We have developed a mean field Virtual Pebble Game (VPG) that represents the ensemble of networks by a single effective network. That is, all possible number of distance constraints (or bars) that can form between a pair of rigid bodies is replaced by the average number. The resulting effective network is viewed as having weighted edges, where the weight of an edge quantifies its capacity to absorb degrees of freedom. The VPG is interpreted as a flow problem on this effective network, which eliminates the need to sample. Across a nonredundant dataset of 272 protein structures, we apply the VPG to proteins for the first time. Our results show numerically and visually that the rigidity characterizations of the VPG accurately reflect the ensemble averaged PḠ properties. This result positions the VPG as an efficient alternative to understand the mechanical role that chemical interactions play in maintaining protein stability.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2012.0

Finding such relationships is important since many applications are interested in how topics come into being, how they develop, grow, disintegrate, and finally disappear. In this paper, we present a novel method that reveals the connections between topics discovered from the text data. Specifically, our method focuses on how one topic splits into multiple topics, and how multiple topics merge into one topic. We adopt the hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) model, and propose an incremental Gibbs sampling algorithm to incrementally derive and refine the labels of clusters. We then characterize the splitting and merging patterns among clusters based on how labels change.

We present the case of deployed emergency medical devices known as automated external defibrillators (AEDs), which serve to treat sudden cardiac arrest on-site within the first few critical minutes of the event. AEDs have become a critical element of basic life support services in many public buildings. The proposed framework is based on the concept of discrete time windows to capture the time-dependence of potential demand and stochastically model the detection time component of impedance as a function of space-time distribution of demand. Different optimization objectives minimizing sudden cardiac arrest outcome consequences (e.g., brain damage or death) as a function of suffering time are formulated and solved. The first model is the multiple-time-window maximal covering location problem model which optimizes the placement of AEDs by maximizing the covered demand over all time periods. The second is the multiple-time-window p-Median model which places AEDs to maximize the expected value of prevented death or permanent brain impairment in case of defibrillation treatment over multiple time windows. Both models are implemented through tight coupling of commercial geographic information system software and a linear programming solver. The models are novel in two primary respects, namely location modeling in 3D microscale spaces and the integration of spatial and temporal considerations.

These services are often delivered by employees who work at widely dispersed locations and interact with each other to constitute knowledge-intensive service delivery networks (KISDNs). This paper contributes to the effective design and management of KISDNs by presenting a mixed-integer programming model that integrates disparate streams of research. This model facilitates analysis and managerial benchmarking of KISDN performance. It captures how the performance of such networks depends on the interaction between workflow decisions, structure of information flow networks (IFNs), and knowledge management decisions. We propose that knowledge about IFNs and worker competence can be effectively used to make workflow decisions. Our results, based on the study of different IFN archetypes, illustrate practices for effective management of KISDNs. Managers can enhance business value by recognizing existing IFNs, increasing randomness in IFNs, nurturing weak or performative ties depending on the archetype, assigning tasks based on effective worker competence, and selectively delaying assignment of tasks to workers.

The developing rainbandswere located ̃400 kmnorth of the storm center as they crossed the Carolina coastline and passed over the mesonet. The combination of moderate CAPE, moderate low-level cross-band vertical shear, and dry midlevel air provided an environment supportive of surface cold pool formation and long-lived quasi-linear convection. Both rainbands exhibited multiple outward-tilting convective cells and discrete line segments centered within a narrow zone of nearly continuous stratiform precipitation. The mesonet observations provided a unique along- and cross-band perspective of discrete cold pools situated beneath and behind the convection portions of each rainband. Prominent cold pools extended 40-80 km behind the rainband's leading edge and exhibited maximum potential temperature, mixing ratio, and equivalent potential temperature deficits of 2-4 K, 1-2 g kg -1, and 4-10 K, respectively. In the cross-band direction, convergence of storm-relative inflow along the cold pool leading edge was coincident with a modest high pressure anomaly, while inflow divergence prevailed through the cold pool and rainfall maxima. Several cold pools expanded along-band while being advected downband by the prevailing cyclonic flow. Cold pool wakes were observed more than 50 km behind the rainband leading edge and up to 20 km downband from intense convection. Variations in cold pool intensity were not well correlated with convective intensity, rainfall rate, or the degree of midlevel dryness.

2-s2.0-84863405044,Article,"We study a supply chain in which a consumer goods manufacturer sells its product through a retailer. The retailer undertakes promotional expenditures, such as advertising, to increase sales and to compete against other retailer(s). The manufacturer supports the retailer's promotional expenditure through a cooperative advertising program by reimbursing a portion (called the subsidy rate) of the retailer's promotional expenditure. To determine the subsidy rate, we formulate a Stackelberg differential game between the manufacturer and the retailer, and a Nash differential subgame between the retailer and the competing retailer(s). We derive the optimal feedback promotional expenditures of the retailers and the optimal feedback subsidy rate of the manufacturer, and show how they are influenced by market parameters. An important finding is that the manufacturer should support its retailer only when a subsidy threshold is crossed. The impact of competition on this threshold is nonmonotone. Specifically, the manufacturer offers more support when its retailer competes with one other retailer but its support starts decreasing with the presence of additional retailers. In the case where the manufacturer sells through all retailers, we show under certain assumptions that it should support only one dominant retailer.

The purpose of this historical analysis was to explore the curricular, ideological and financial obstacles that contributed to the eventual demise of the MACOS project. The author proposes that federally funded MACOS challenged the ""history-asnational- progress"" paradigm of the early to mid-twentieth century. This precipitated an ideological ""conflict"" that called into question the nature and purpose of social studies education. The study of MACOS's demise provides an insightful lesson on how the reception of curriculum innovation is subject to changing sociopolitical ideologies and the practicalities of instructional implementation.",Education,"Middle, Secondary, and K-12 Education",2012.0
2-s2.0-84863525831,Article,"Cooperative communication (CC) exploits space diversity through allowing multiple nodes cooperatively relay signals to the receiver so that the combined signal at the receiver can be correctly decoded. Since CC can reduce the transmission power and extend the transmission coverage, it has been considered in topology control protocols [1], [2]. However, prior research on topology control with CC only focuses on maintaining the network connectivity, minimizing the transmission power of each node, whereas ignores the energy efficiency of paths in constructed topologies. This may cause inefficient routes and hurt the overall network performance in cooperative ad hoc networks. In this paper, to address this problem, we introduce a new topology control problem: energy-efficient topology control problem with cooperative communication, and propose two topology control algorithms to build cooperative energy spanners in which the energy efficiency of individual paths are guaranteed. Both proposed algorithms can be performed in distributed and localized fashion while maintaining the globally efficient paths. Simulation results confirm the nice performance of all proposed algorithms.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2012.0
2-s2.0-84863548885,Article,"The Summer Olympics bring hundreds of thousands of visitors and generate upward of $10 billion in spending for the host city. This large influx of tourism dollars is only part of the overall impact of hosting the Olympic Games. In order to host the visitors and sporting events, cities must make sizable investments in infrastructure such as airports, arenas, and highways. Additionally, the publicity and international exposure of a host city may benefit international trade and capital flows. Proponents argue that this investment will pay off through increased economic growth, but research confirming these claims is lacking. This paper examines whether hosting an Olympiad improves a city's long-term growth. In order to control for the self-selection of cities that host Olympic Games, this paper matches Olympic host cities with cities that were finalists for the Olympic Games, but were not selected by the International Olympic Committee. A difference-in-difference estimator examines post-Olympic impacts for host cities between 1950 and 2005. Regression results provide no long-term impacts of hosting an Olympics on two measures of population, real Gross Domestic Product per capita and trade openness.

Conversion of these SNPs to the cost-effective and flexible throughput Competitive Allele Specific PCR (KASPar) assays generated successful assays for 2005 SNPs. These marker assays have been designated as Chickpea KASPar Assay Markers (CKAMs). Screening of 70 genotypes including 58 diverse chickpea accessions and 12 BC 3F 2 lines showed 1341 CKAMs as being polymorphic. Genetic analysis of these data clustered chickpea accessions based on geographical origin. Genotyping data generated for 671 CKAMs on the reference mapping population (Cicer arietinum ICC 4958×Cicer reticulatum PI 489777) were compiled with 317 unpublished TOG-SNPs and 396 published markers for developing the genetic map. As a result, a second-generation genetic map comprising 1328 marker loci including novel 625 CKAMs, 314 TOG-SNPs and 389 published marker loci with an average inter-marker distance of 0.59cM was constructed. Detailed analyses of 1064 mapped loci of this second-generation chickpea genetic map showed a higher degree of synteny with genome of Medicago truncatula, followed by Glycine max, Lotus japonicus and least with Vigna unguiculata.

This has been studied extensively for datasets containing 3D surfaces and 3D networks but less for so volumetric data. Volumetric data is characterized by a heavy presence of transparency, occlusion and highly ambiguous spatial structure. There are many different rendering and visualization algorithms and interactive techniques that enhance perception of volume data and these techniques' effectiveness have been evaluated. However, the effect of VR displays on perception of volume data is less well studied. Therefore, we conduct two experiments on how various display conditions affect a participant's depth perception accuracy of a volumetric dataset. A demographic pre-questionnaire also allows us to separate the accuracy differences between participants with more and less experience with 3D games and VR. Our results show an overall benefit for stereo with head-tracking for enhancing perception of depth in volumetric data.

Throughout the research community, there is a lack of consensus regarding both the nature of intuition and, more importantly, how to systematically incorporate it into the design of multi-touch gestural interactions. To strengthen our understanding of intuition, we surveyed various domains to determine the level of consensus among researchers, commercial developers, and the general public regarding which multi-touch gestures are intuitive, and which of these gestures intuitively lead to which interaction outcomes. We reviewed more than one hundred papers regarding multi-touch interaction, approximately thirty of which contained key findings we report herein. Based on these findings, we have constructed a framework of five factors that determine the intuition of multi-touch interactions, including direct manipulation, physics, feedback, previous knowledge, and physical motion. We further provide both design recommendations for multi-touch developers and an evaluation of research problems which remain due to the limitations of present research regarding these factors.

Design and Setting: In 2006, a combination mail/phone survey was sent to all mothers of children with OFC. The questionnaire included 76 items. A final open-ended question was included for additional information about cleftrelated care. The analysis included responses to the open-ended question and sociodemographic characteristics of the respondents. Qualitative responses were transcribed and entered into a qualitative software package for analysis, and common themes were elucidated. Participants/Patients: The North Carolina Birth Defects Monitoring Program was used to identify all resident infants born with OFC from 2001 to 2004. Of 478 eligible mothers, 52.9% (n = 248) responded to the survey, and 39.5% (n = 98) responded to the final open-ended question. Main Outcome Measures: Percentage reporting problems accessing care, frequency of positive and negative comments, and indicators of financial, personal, and structural barriers to care. Results: Of the 98 respondents, the majority (n = 95, 96.99%) were the biological mother. Almost 40% of mothers indicated that accessing primary craniofacial care was a problem.

This review aims to provide an overview of studies investigating their effects on skeletal muscle, in particular the repair processes in injured muscle. Muscle injury occurs in diverse situations and the nature of muscle injuries varies significantly, complicating extrapolations between experimental models and ""real life."" Classical muscle strain injuries occur at the interphase between the muscle fibers and connective tissue, most often in the myotendinuous junction, whereas contusion or overload injury can damage both myofibers and intramuscular connective tissue. The role of NSAIDs in muscle repair is complicated by differences in injury models used, variables evaluated, and time point(s) selected for evaluations. While the temporal pattern of the influence of NSAIDs on muscle repair is difficult to settle on, it appears that a potential beneficial effect of NSAIDs in the early phase after injury is not maintained in the long term, or is even negated by a long-term repair deficit. At the cellular level, evidence exists for a negative influence of NSAIDs on the muscle stem cell population (satellite cells).

We specify the flowbit evasion attack and provide practical algorithms to solve it with controllable false positives and formally prove their correctness and completeness. We implemented a tool called SFET which can automatically parse a Snort rule set, generate all possible sequences that can evade it, as well as produce a patch to guard the rule set against those evasions.

Toward this goal, the HMP has characterized the microbial communities at 18 body habitats in a cohort of over 200 healthy volunteers using 16S rRNA gene (16S) sequencing and has generated nearly 1,000 reference genomes from human-associated microorganisms. To determine how well current reference genome collections capture the diversity observed among the healthy microbiome and to guide isolation and future sequencing of microbiome members, we compared the HMP's 16S data sets to several reference 16S collections to create a 'most wanted' list of taxa for sequencing. Our analysis revealed that the diversity of commonly occurring taxa within the HMP cohort microbiome is relatively modest, few novel taxa are represented by these OTUs and many common taxa among HMP volunteers recur across different populations of healthy humans. Taken together, these results suggest that it should be possible to perform whole-genome sequencing on a large fraction of the human microbiome, including the 'most wanted', and that these sequences should serve to support microbiome studies across multiple cohorts. Also, in stark contrast to other taxa, the 'most wanted' organisms are poorly represented among culture collections suggesting that novel culture- and single-cell-based methods will be required to isolate these organisms for sequencing.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2012.0

2-s2.0-84864450995,Conference Paper,"Continuum manipulators, featuring ""continuous backbone structures"", are promising for deft manipulation of a wide range of objects under uncertain conditions in less-structured and cluttered environments. A multi-section trunk/tentacle robot is such a continuum manipulator. With a continuum robot, manipulation means a continuous whole arm motion, where the arm is often bent into a continuously deforming concave shape. To approximate such an arm with a polygonal mesh for collision detection is expensive not only because a fine mesh is required to approximate concavity but also because each time the manipulator deforms, a new mesh has to be built for the new configuration. However, most generic collision detection algorithms apply to only polygonal meshes or objects of convex primitives. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm for Collision Detection between an Exact Continuum Manipulator (CD-ECoM) and its environments, which is applicable to any continuum manipulator featuring multiple constant-curvature sections.

2-s2.0-84864454881,Conference Paper,"Six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) haptic rendering is challenging when multi-region contacts occur between the graphic avatar of a haptic tool operated by a human user, which we call the graphic tool, and deformable objects. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for deformation modeling based on a spring-sphere tree representation of deformable objects and a configuration-based constrained optimization method for determining the 6-dimensional configuration of the graphic tool and the contact force/torque response to the tool. This method conducts collision detection, deformation computation, and tool configuration optimization very efficiently based on the spring-sphere tree model, avoids inter-penetration, and maintains stability of haptic display without using virtual coupling. Experiments on typical dental operations are carried out to validate the efficiency and stability of the proposed method. The update rate of the haptic simulation loop is maintained at ∼1kHz.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2012.0
2-s2.0-84864472715,Article,"The ultramodern condition represents the ""third wave"" in postmodernist-inspired philosophy and cultural practice. Two of ultramodernism's critical theoretical components are the human/social forces, flows, and assemblages that sustain transgression; and the human/social intensities, fluctuations, and thresholds that make transcendence possible as both will and way. In the ultramodern age, then, transcendence is about overcoming and transforming the conditions (i. e., forces, flows, and assemblages) that co-produce harm-generating (i. e., transgressive) tendencies. This manuscript problematizes transgression by way of ultramodern theory. This critical investigation represents ""the phenomenology of the shadow,"" or the ultramodern philosophy of harm. To contextualize this phenomenology and philosophy, the intellectual history of ultramodern thought is recounted. This includes a review of the shadow construct by way of its prominent socio-cultural, psychoanalytic, and political-economic currents; and a chronicling of the reification process (regarding risk, captivity, and harm) since the modernist era (i. e., the industrial revolution). The article concludes with some very speculative observations concerning ""the phenomenology of the stranger,"" or the ultramodern philosophy of transcendence as both will and way.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Criminal Justice and Criminology,2012.0
2-s2.0-84864478753,Article,"Using a generalized McFadden specification, we estimate the determinants of hourly response for the years 2006 through 2010 for all 16 standard retail customers who were on an optional real-time electricity rate offered by Duke Energy as of 2010, and provide a method to estimate how these customers would respond to time-of-use (TOU) and flat rates. We generalize the model to allow for inter-day response, as well as threshold prices, above which individual customer response may increase or decrease. With these inclusions, we find hourly elasticity for the group of customers to be as large as -0. 7, larger than previous studies. We apply the method to examine a recent finding that time-differentiated rates could increase electric utility emissions. However, that result did not differentiate between real-time and TOU rates, and furthermore held energy use constant in comparing flat rates and time-differentiated rates. We perform a case study to examine emissions of SO 2, NOx, Hg, and CO 2 based on predicted energy use changes as well as for an energy-neutral case for real-time, TOU and flat rates. Employing energy use predictions from the model, increased energy use results in increased emissions in almost all cases. For the energy-neutral case, time-differentiated rates increase CO 2 as compared to flat rates, and the TOU rate causes a larger increase than does real-time pricing. But both rates decrease other emissions in the majority of years, particularly SO 2 In addition, time-differentiated rates reduce NOx potency by shifting it to non-daylight hours when conditions for the formation of smog are less favorable. Our application leads to the conclusion that the effect of the rates on emissions must consider total energy use as well as the shift from peak to off-peak. Furthermore, the predictions require consideration of the generating mix at a more detailed level than was contained in previous studies.",Business,Economics,2012.0

The core nucleosome remodeling function of the mammalian NuRD complex is executed by the helicase-domain-containing ATPase CHD4 (Mi-2β) subunit, which also contains N-terminal plant homeodomain (PHD) and chromo domains. The mode of regulation of chromatin remodeling by CHD4 is not well understood, nor is the role of its PHD and chromo domains. Here, we use small-angle X-ray scattering, nucleosome binding ATPase and remodeling assays, limited proteolysis, cross-linking, and tandem mass spectrometry to propose a three-dimensional structural model describing the overall shape and domain interactions of CHD4 and discuss the relevance of these for regulating the remodeling of chromatin by the NuRD complex.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2012.0

Using the framework developed by P. Connelly and York (2003), this case study illustrates how the lack of leadership and adaptive capacity within the board of directors, coupled with questions and speculation about managerial capacity, contributed to a highly visible scandal that resulted in the loss of the agency's chief executive officer, the resignation of the chairman of the board of directors, an internal investigation, and ultimately, a federal investigation. Not only did these events hurt the agency, which was forced to eliminate programs and cut staff, but these events hurt the annual campaign, which declined by more than 30 percent, resulting in substantial cuts in funding to dozens of nonprofit organizations.

The resulting model, MultiGAP, addresses the assignment of tasks to agents within each time period, with the attendant single-period assignment costs and agent-capacity constraint requirements, in conjunction with transition costs arising between any two consecutive periods in which a task is reassigned to a different agent. As is the case for its single-period antecedent, MultiGAP offers a robust tool for modeling a wide range of capacity planning problems occurring within supply chain management. We provide two formulations for MultiGAP and establish that the second (alternative) formulation provides a tighter bound. We define a Lagrangian relaxation-based heuristic as well as a branch-and-bound algorithm for MultiGAP. Computational experience with the heuristic and branch-and-bound algorithm on over 2500 test problems is reported.

The results show that there are significant differences between employees' and supervisors' experiences of disputant-disputant interpersonal justice. Moreover, the results indicate that the quality of participants' interactions in mediation is significantly related to the quality of the mediated outcome in terms of settlement or case resolution. When disputants experience interpersonal justice with each other during mediation, they are more likely to reach a full resolution to the dispute. When disputants corroborate each other's reports of their own behaviors during mediation, they are also more likely to achieve settlement of the mediation. Disputants who received an apology from the other party were more likely to report a settlement to the dispute.

Studies of this association have yielded conflicting results and have not fully considered other factors that may play a role in academic performance. This study examines the relation between depression and academic performance in students at a large urban university in North Carolina. We analyzed data from student responses to the 2008 cross-sectional National College Health Assessment to create categories of depressive symptomatology. E-mail invitations to participate in the assessment were sent to 8,000 students at the university in an effort to obtain at least 900 responses, the minimum number considered valid for a campus of its size. We analyzed the responses of the 1,280 undergraduates who completed the survey. Logistic regression analyses were performed to examine associations between depressive symptoms and academic performance in this group. Students in the second, third, and fourth quartiles of depressive symptomatology had increased, though statistically non-significant, odds of having a lower cumulative grade average, even after adjustment for age, sex, year in school, race/ethnicity, substance use, and level of credit-card debt. This difference was most pronounced among students in the second quartile of depressive symptomatology. This cross-sectional study did not allow for evaluation of causality. In addition, the self-report nature of this questionnaire could have led to some inaccuracy in reporting.

Here, we present a chronosequence of soils on five well-expressed, unpaired alluvial terraces from the Catawba River near Charlotte, NC. Ten soil profiles were excavated and described on the terrace sequence. Soil pits were sampled by horizon and the &lt;2 mm fraction analyzed for particle size and extractable iron. Ages are assigned to the terrace units through comparison with regional surface age/elevation curves (Mills, 2000). The elevations (and calculated ages) of the terraces above the modern channel are: 3 m (4±0.5 ka), 10 m (50±6 ka), 14 m (128±16 ka), 28 m (610±75 ka), 42 m (1, 470±180 ka). Color hue, pedogenic iron (Fe d) and clay content (%) recorded positive trends with increasing terrace age. Specifically, these variables increased from 10YR to 2.5YR, 3.6% to 6.4%, and 21.9% to 62.6% respectively, from the lowest (∼4 ka) to the highest (∼1, 470 ka) terrace. These results are consistent with regional chronosequence studies developed in different physiographic provinces and parent materials. This consistency implies that the relatively rapid oxidation of iron bearing minerals and development of pedogenic clays overshadows the effect of differences in parent material and regional climate. The rate of development of these soil properties plateaus after ∼128 ka. Fe 0/Fe d ratios and clay contents record a break in soil development between -128 and 50 ka, which is ascribed to the inheritance of re worked, previously weathered material. These results indicate a unique, dramatic change in the sediment provenance of the Catawba River from the erosion of relatively unweathered bedrock to relatively well developed soils, stripped from basin hillslopes during this time period. This switch represents a major change in landscape evolution likely driven by the colder climatic conditions of the Late Pleistocene. Sedimentological changes from cobble gravel facies to sand facies indicates that terrace formation was coupled with a change in fluvial transport capacity prior to ∼128 ka. These data represent some of the first insights into the longterm soil and landscape evolution of a major drainage in this region of the Piedmont.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2012.0

Methods: Participants used a VM with coitus during 4-week cycles over a 3-year period in random timing sequences: 1h before coitus, 10min before coitus and 10min after coitus. Daily diaries collected information related to coital behaviours, VM use and timing, and participants' and partners' VM assessments. Descriptive and mixed-effects model analyses were conducted. Results: At least three VM timing conditions were completed by 109 women aged 18-22 years old. Of 17 772 diary days collected, coitus was reported on 2128 (1252 with VM use; 59%). Median times between VM application and coitus were: 60min before coitus (mean=68.2; s.d.=76.9) for the 1-h pre-coital group, 13.5min before coitus (mean=44.9; s.d.=117.1) for the 10-min pre-coital group and 5min before coitus (mean=24.5; s.d.=205.1) for the 10-min post-coital group. Women reported that the VM was very easy to use (68%), it was somewhat messy (61%), they were very wet during sex (81%), sex was very good (80%) and their partners liked using the VM (38%).

2-s2.0-84865011160,Conference Paper,"This work presents an algorithm to provide a better representation of space to artificially intelligent characters (i.e., agents or bots) in game and simulation environments by providing a more accurate breakdown of the traversable space present in the game environment. Such representations are generally constructed by decomposing the walkable space present in a game environment into a series of convex regions to form a data structure called a navigation mesh. We extend the basic concept of a navigation mesh by the introduction of an understanding of the textures that are attached to the under-lying geometry creating what we refer to as a texture-aware navigation mesh. This does result in a more complex navigation mesh (more regions and a larger search space). However, since the textures of walkable geometry can be used to determine the appropriate traversal method for that terrain, a game character can determine valid paths for their traversal methods using just the navigation mesh (e.g., characters in cars can generate paths containing just roads or walking characters can create paths containing just sidewalks). We also present a use case that shows how such a system of texture aware navigation meshes might benefit character path planning and search in virtual environments. In this use case, we examine a Real Time Strategy game style game environment, which shows it is possible to generate a navigation mesh such that each region is composed of a single terrain type.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2012.0

Transfer students at this institution have shown a higher level of persistence and higher graduation rate in comparison to traditional engineering students (students who are 18-20 years old and recently graduated from high school). The qualitative analysis showed that the females' choice of major was largely influenced and supported by either their family, or caring faculty members who voluntarily served as their mentors. In contrast, male students appeared to have more diverse reasons for their transfer decisions. The social and cultural transition experience of male and female students also exhibited a sharp contrast. Male transfer/non-traditional students found themselves receiving respect from younger students, while female students faced multiple challenges including lack of peer support, financial hardship, and family-related responsibilities. In particular, their team work experiences illuminated an interesting facet of social dynamics that they encountered in relation to younger male and female students. Findings derived from the larger survey data and thematic analysis of the interview data collected from 77 traditional engineering students were partially used to contextualize the unique aspects of the transition experiences and perspectives of transfer/ nontraditional students.",Education,Educational Leadership,2012.0
2-s2.0-84865022911,Article,"The federal government has long used grants-in-aid to encourage state and local governments to carry out federal policies. Little research has been done that examines how short-term seed grants affect program continuation. We propose the ""fly ball effect"" as a theoretical framework for understanding how seed money should impact program maintenance. Our theory suggests that short-term seed grants by themselves should result in considerable funding uncertainty and program eliminations or stagnation once the initial grant money expires. We use data from drug court start-ups in four states to provide empirical support for our theory. We argue that understanding the logic of the fly ball effect can help granting governments to improve the effectiveness of their grant funding systems, at least as measured by strong program continuation and expansion.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Political Science and Public Administration,2011.0

The analyses revealed limited evidence of reliability and validity of social engagement measures. Related to the importance of peer-related social engagement for student success, engineering or STEM-related social engagement was more frequently observed as a significant variable than non-engineering related/general social engagement. The construct of social engagement is also found to be more important among traditionally underrepresented groups in engineering such as women and ethnic minority students. The authors suggest that future research should include the re-development of the social engagement concept to reflect distinguishing characteristics of engineering fields.",Education,Educational Leadership,2012.0

The specific target of this effort, which is tied to an ongoing NSF research grant, is Latino civil engineering students, with the aim to increase Latino faculty in the field of earthquake engineering. However it can be applied to any URM population or engineering field. The simple BDP model described in this paper is believed to have good potential for success. The proposed BDP is in the early implementation stages as part of an ongoing NSF project with a selected focus on attracting graduate students from Latino groups to doctorate programs in participating Research I universities on the mainland US. The approach to set up the BDP was modeled after the successful NSF program Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP). A key component of the BDP was the partnership with an institution (UPRM) with a large population of the target URM (Latinos). Important features of the program are the active participation of UPRM in research, exchange between students and faculty at UPRM and mainland US universities, and participation of external faculty members on graduate committees. Implementation of the project is in its initial stages, and the authors are keen to share their experiences and learn from other engineering educators who have designed and administered similar initiatives.",Education,Educational Leadership,2012.0

In view of the historical risks in the lives of children who are experiencing homelessness (e.g., growing up under conditions of poverty, exposure to family violence), it is clear that interventions, services, and supports need to be equally comprehensive to have a positive influence on child functioning and development. Consequently, service systems, providers, and community supports need to address the circumstances of children and families experiencing homelessness and, more specifically, better attend to their ecologies and the diverse factors that can affect their well-being and adjustment trajectories.

Specific features of each level of the implementation are described including screening and tier placement procedures, scheduling and personnel supports, procedures for ensuring strong implementation with fidelity, procedures for student progress monitoring, and guidelines for instructional decision making. Early literacy skill outcomes for students were the primary dependent measures in reading; schoolwide office discipline referral rate was the dependent measure in behavior. Significant improvement was evident in phoneme segmentation and nonsense word fluency in reading and significant decreases were documented in office discipline referrals across treatment and comparison schools. Significantly higher outcomes were also recorded on required statewide end-of-grade assessments in treatment schools. Implications and caveats concerning effective implementation of the model in other settings are provided.

The Nintendo Wii Balance Board, which is part of the Wii Fit game, could be an effective tool to monitor progress during rehabilitation because the board and game can provide objective measures of balance. However, the validity and reliability of Wii Fit balance scores remain unknown. Objective: To determine the concurrent validity of balance scores produced by the Wii Fit game and the intrasession and intersession reliability of Wii Fit balance scores. Design: Descriptive laboratory study. Setting: Sports medicine research laboratory. Patients or Other Participants: Forty-five recreationally active participants (age = 27.0 ± 9.8 years, height = 170.9 ± 9.2 cm, mass = 72.4 ± 11.8 kg) with a heterogeneous history of lower extremity injury. Intervention(s): Participants completed a single-limb-stance task on a force plate and the Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT) during the first test session. Twelve Wii Fit balance activities were completed during 2 test sessions separated by 1 week. Main Outcome Measure(s): Postural sway in the anteroposterior (AP) and mediolateral (ML) directions and the AP, ML, and resultant center-of-pressure (COP) excursions were calculated from the single-limb stance. The normalized reach distance was recorded for the anterior, posteromedial, and posterolateral directions of the SEBT. Wii Fit balance scores that the game software generated also were recorded. Results: All 96 of the calculated correlation coefficients among Wii Fit activity outcomes and established balance outcomes were interpreted as poor (r < 0.50). Intrasession reliability for Wii Fit balance activity scores ranged from good (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.80) to poor (ICC = 0.39), with 8 activities having poor intrasession reliability. Similarly, 11 of the 12 Wii Fit balance activity scores demonstrated poor intersession reliability, with scores ranging from fair (ICC = 0.74) to poor (ICC = 0.29). Conclusions: Wii Fit balance activity scores had poor concurrent validity relative to COP outcomes and SEBT reach distances.

This study examined if antagonist muscle coactivation during maximal dynamic knee extension was elevated in subjects with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) deficiency compared to age-matched healthy controls. Methods: Electromyography (EMG) and net knee joint moments were recorded during maximal concentric quadriceps and eccentric hamstring contractions, performed in an isokinetic dynamometer (ROM: 90-10°, angular speed: 30°/s). Hamstring antagonist EMG recorded during concentric quadriceps contraction was converted into antagonist moment based on the EMG-moment relationship observed during eccentric agonist contractions. Results: The magnitude of antagonist hamstring EMG was 65.5% higher in ACL deficient subjects compared to healthy controls (p. <. 0.05). Likewise, antagonist hamstring moment expressed in percentage of the measured net extension moment was elevated in ACL deficient subjects (56. ±. 8 to 30. ±. 6%) compared to controls (36. ±. 5 to 19. ±. 2%) at 20-50° of knee flexion (0°=full extension) (p. <. 0.05). Discussion: The results showed a marked increase in hamstring coactivation towards more extended joint positions. Notably, this progressive rise in coactivation was greater in ACL deficient subjects, which may reflect a compensatory strategy to provide stability to the knee joint in the anterior-posterior plane during isolated knee extension. The present study encourages further investigations of hamstring coactivation in ACL deficient subjects.",CHHS,Kinesiology,2012.0

We investigated the relationship between dysfunctional interpersonal tendencies, derailment potential behaviors, and actual managerial derailment in the form of voluntary and involuntary turnover. Data were from an archival database of high-level managers working for a global retail organization, including self-report interpersonal tendencies, 360-degree feedback data, and personnel history (N = 1,796). Managers who exhibit the dysfunctional interpersonal tendencies associated with ""moving against people"" were more likely to enact derailment potential behaviors.

This study advances our understanding of the managerial derailment process by providing evidence of the positive relationship between derailment potential behaviors and both voluntary and involuntary turnover as well as the potential for ""moving against"" people to result in derailment. Our results may help to inform the selection, promotion, and training strategies employed by practitioners and potentially reduce the costs associated with losing high-potential executives. This is one of the first studies to provide evidence of the relationship between derailment potential behaviors and turnover, and in a rarely obtained sample of high-level managers.

First, during the in-tree phase of a simulation game, the parameters are randomized in selected ranges before each simulation move. Second, during the play-out phase, the priority orders of the simulation move-generators are hierarchically randomized before each play-out move. Essential domain knowledge used in MCTS for Go is discussed. Both dynamic randomization techniques increase diversity while keeping the sanity of the simulation games.

Using 2006-2009 intake data from a Kenyan non-governmental aid agency, this cross-sectional study evaluated a population of 1,424 children in two urban slum settlements in Nairobi. Logistic regression was used to obtain adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals to examine the relationship between family composition measures and child well-being. Multivariate results were also stratified by orphan status. Vulnerable children who live in household sizes of 4-6 members and vulnerable children who live with non-relatives had greater odds of inadequate immunization (OR = 1.51, 95% CI: 1.13-2.01, OR = 9.02, 95% CI: 4.62-17.62). Paradoxically, vulnerable children living with non-relative caregivers were at lower risk for inadequate food (OR = 0.19, 95% CI 0.07-0.33). Single orphans with an HIV positive parent were less likely to be fully immunized than single orphans with an HIV negative parent. The results provide information on specific groups which could benefit from increased attention related to childhood immunization education and intervention programs.

Little is known about the etiology of this disorder, and the development of a good animal model for overuse tendinopathy is essential for advancing insight into the disease mechanisms. Our aim was to test a previously proposed rat model for Achilles tendon overuse. Ten adult male Sprague-Dawley rats ran on a treadmill with 10° incline, 1 h/day, 5 days/wk (17-20 m/min) for 12 wk and were compared with 12 control rats. Histological, mechanical, and gene-expression changes were measured on the Achilles tendons after the intervention, and local tendon glucose-uptake was measured before and after the intervention with positron emission tomography. No differences were detected between runners and controls in tissue histology or in glucose uptake, indicating that tendon pathology was not induced. Greater tendon tissue modulus (P < 0.005) and failure stress/body weight (P < 0.02) in runners compared with controls further supported that tendons successfully adapted to uphill running. Several genes of interest were regulated after 12 wk of running. Expression of collagen III and insulin-like growth factor I was increased, while collagen I was unchanged, and decreases were seen in noncollagen matrix components (fibromodulin and biglycan), matrix degrading enzymes, transforming growth factor-β1, and connective tissue growth factor. In conclusion, the tested model could not be validated as a model for Achilles tendinopathy, as the rats were able to adapt to 12 wk of uphill running without any signs of tendinopathy. Improved mechanical properties were observed, as well as changes in gene-expression that were distinctly different from what is seen in tendinopathy and in response to short-term tendon loading.",CHHS,Kinesiology,2012.0

Methods: Tissue from 12 young males (AA, n= 6; CC, n= 6) was obtained from routine forensic autopsies. Iliopsoas and Achilles tendon samples were obtained from cadavers that were age, height and weight matched. Tendon collagen fascicles were tested micromechanically in a Deben mechanical testing rig. Results: Peak failure stress in Iliopsoas tendon fascicles was considerably higher (p<. 0.05) in AA (22.4. ±. 7.2. MPa) than CC (6.8. ±. 2.1.

Advances in radiocarbon dating and calibration now give us some ability to refine or rebuild the chronology, and guidelines for obtaining the most useful dates are discussed. Dates recently obtained from the site of Chamical in the southern highlands of Ecuador are evaluated according to those guidelines, and they suggest Inca expansion to the north began 1 to 2 decades earlier than allowed in the traditional chronology. The chronology of Inca expansion presented in the Spanish chronicles is called into question by these and other dates, and by a reconsideration of the nature of sources of Inca history utilized by Spanish writers. Evidence suggests a primary Inca form of recording provincial conquests resulted in lists that were ordered geographically. However, those records were interpreted by colonial writers as being chronologically ordered, which led to written histories of Inca expansion that are not consistent with the actual historical sequence of events. As a result, the preferred approach to building a chronology of Inca expansion should be based on 14C dates, with historical sources used to supplement rather than structure the timeline.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Anthropology,2012.0
2-s2.0-84865961740,Article,"Effective river management strategies require an understanding of how fluvial processes vary both spatially and temporally. Here, we examine the natural range of variability in the Conejos River Valley, southern Colorado, through documentation of terrace morphostratigraphic and sedimentological characteristics as well as through investigation of sediment contributions from headwaters, hillslopes and tributary streams. Additionally, soil development and radiocarbon ages, together with local and regional paleoclimate reconstructions, were used to infer the range of processes acting in this system. Since de-glaciation, the Conejos River has fluctuated between episodes of bedrock strath formation, aggradation and vertical incision. Morphostratigraphic relationships, soil development and radiocarbon ages enable us to propose a chronology for periods of alluvial deposition (around 8·9-7·6ka, 5·5ka and from 3·5 to 1·1ka), separated by intervals of fluvial incision. We infer potential forcing mechanisms by utilizing multiple working hypotheses. Specifically, we discuss the potential for increases in sediment supply during periods of (1) para-glacial adjustment, (2) climatic cooling, (3) increased frequency of climate change and (4) increased fire frequency or severity. We also consider the effects of changes in stream discharge and extreme storm occurrence. We conclude that combinations of these processes, operating at different times, have contributed to sediment mobilization since de-glaciation. Stream and landform morphology also varies longitudinally due to the influence of remnant glacial topography. In particular, valley bottom overdeepening at tributary junctions has resulted in incision and strath formation into unlithified glacial deposits (i.e. fill-cut terraces) rather than bedrock in some reaches. Overall, the Conejos fluvial system has varied significantly both temporally and spatially since de-glaciation and appears to be sensitive to changes in sediment supply related to Holocene scale climate fluctuations. This natural range of variability must therefore be a key consideration in any future stream management policies.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2012.0

The goal of this research is to develop innovative and replicable strategies to improve community health in disadvantaged communities such as newly arrived Hispanic immigrants. Methods/design. This project is taking place within a primary care practice-based research network (PBRN) using key principles of community-based participatory research (CBPR). Associations between social determinants and rates of hospitalizations, emergency department (ED) use, and ED use for primary care treatable or preventable conditions are being examined. Geospatial models are in development using both hospital and community level data to identify local areas where interventions to improve disparities would have the greatest impact. The developed associations between social determinants and health outcomes as well as the geospatial models will be validated using community surveys and qualitative methods. A rapidly growing and underserved Hispanic immigrant population will be the target of an intervention informed by the research process to impact utilization of primary care services and designed, deployed, and evaluated using the geospatial tools and qualitative research findings. The purpose of this intervention will be to reduce health disparities by improving access to, and utilization of, primary care and preventative services. Discussion. The results of this study will demonstrate the importance of several novel approaches to ameliorating health disparities, including the use of CBPR, the effectiveness of community-based interventions to influence health outcomes by leveraging social networks, and the importance of primary care access in ameliorating health disparities.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2012.0

Teachers were trained to follow a task analysis to teach grade-aligned math to middle school students using adapted math problem stories and graphic organizers. The teacher implemented four math units representing four of the five National Council of Teachers of Mathematics recommended math standards (i.e., algebra, geometry, measurement, and data analysis/ probability; NCTM, 2002). A multiple probe across unit design was used to examine the effects of the math instruction on the number of steps completed on each math standard task analysis. Results indicated a functional relationship between math instruction and student behavior with an overall increase in independent correct responses.

Meetings are one of the organizational sites in which organizational actors ""do"" creativity; interaction in groups can be an important site for generating creative ideas and brainstorming. Additionally, Blount (2004) demonstrated the importance of organizational temporalities for group performance. We draw on both of these literatures and examine how temporal structures influence the climate for creativity, or the extent to which creativity is fostered, within groups. Specifically, we develop a hypothesis linking organization- and job-level temporal structures to the extent to which managers structure meetings with a climate supportive of creativity. Our results demonstrate that a nuanced relationship exists between temporal structures and creative climate such that certain temporal structures appear to either enhance or decrease the creative climate of meetings.

2-s2.0-84866157923,Article,"The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) has conducted well over 1000 inspections of public accounting firms since 2004, the year their inspections began. The PCAOB inspections are mandated by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and are designed to promote high professional audit standards and improve the audit quality of registered public accounting firms (. U.S. House, 2002). Since then, a growing body of research has emerged focusing on the process, results, and decision implications of the inspections. Most of the research to date has focused on determining the impact of the inspection regimen from the perspective of regulators, clients, or markets, but there has been very little research focused on the effect of inspections on the accounting firms themselves.We evaluate the letters provided by triennial audit firms (100 or fewer issuer clients) to the PCAOB in response to their inspections. The response letters provide insight into what the firms themselves think about the value of the inspection and the results of the inspections. Our study and its findings are particularly timely in light of the PCAOB Chairman James Doty's recent speech (. Doty, 2011) in which he claimed that deficiencies were concrete instances of audit failure, and sharply criticized the responses of many audit firms who received inspection deficiency reports, most of whom maintain that their deficiency finding resulted from either differences in professional judgment or inadequate documentation, or both (but not audit deficiencies).We find that a majority of firms writing response letters (1) state they support the PCAOB's objective of improving audit quality and (2) believe the inspection process will lead to higher audit quality. However, a substantial majority of firms that had an audit engagement deficiency disagreed with the PCAOB's evaluation, citing differences in professional judgment and/or documentation issues. Our findings do not support but run counter to the PCAOB Chairman's criticisms and insistence that inspection deficiencies are not attributable to professional judgment differences.",Business,Accounting,2012.0
2-s2.0-84866236501,Article,"Due to the growing application of peer-to-peer computing, the distributed applications are continuously spreading over an extensive number of nodes. To cope with this large number of participants, various cluster based hierarchical solutions have been proposed. Cluster or group based solutions are scalable for a large number of participants. All of these solutions exploit the idea of coordinators, leaders or proxies of the clusters. If any such node fails, the election of a new one is required. Thus, fault tolerance of these algorithms is low. Again, as the number of participating nodes increases every day, it is necessary to devise highly scalable distributed mutual exclusion algorithms. This research presents a permission based parallel solution of distributed mutual exclusion by modeling a multilevel clustered network, where clusters are formed at different hierarchies. This technique enhances the scalability by reducing the cluster size, as it requires consensus from only one cluster at each level. As the algorithm has no use of coordinators, it possesses high fault tolerance. The paper also addresses the problem of achieving optimal level of clustering in a network for distributed mutual exclusion.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2012.0

In a prior study on TBI irritability, relational interactions were one of four dimensions of irritability occurrence and precipitation. This present analysis examines these same data in greater detail. Methods: Fifty focus group transcripts from a study on irritability were re-analysed to examine: (1) irritability in spousal relationships following TBI, (2) retrospective accounts of spousal interactions contributing to irritability and (3) impact of irritability on marital relationships. Grounded Theory was used to develop themes, metacodes and theories. Results: Several theories emerged regarding irritability with respect to spousal relations, all based on the overarching theory that irritability in people with TBI has a strong relational component involved in triggering, experiencing and preventing irritability. Sub-theories supporting this include: (1) irritability breeds further irritability, (2) spousal responses can trigger irritability among persons with TBI and vice versa, (3) difficulties making emotional connections may incite negative interactions, (4) expectations of others may contribute to irritable behaviour, and (5) communication breakdowns may provoke irritability. Conclusions: Irritability associated with TBI resides in the family system as well as the individual.

Using Supramap we have developed maps of the spread of drug-resistant influenza and host shifts in H1N1 and H5N1 influenza and coronaviruses such as SARS. Here we report on another zoonotic pathogen, H7 influenza, and provide an update on the implementation of Supramap as a web service. We find that the emergence of pathogenic strains of H7 is labile with many transitions from high to low pathogenicity, and from low to high pathogenicity. We use Supramap to put these events in a temporal and geospatial context. We identify several lineages of H7 influenza with biomarkers of high pathogenicity in regions that have not been reported in the scientific literature. The original implementation of Supramap was built with tightly coupled client and server software. Now we have decoupled the components to provide a modular web service for POY (http://poyws.org) that can be consumed by a data provider to create a novel application. To demonstrate the web service, we have produced an application, Geogenes (http://geogenes.org). Unlike in Supramap, in which the user is required to create and upload data files, in Geogenes the user works from a graphical interface to query an underlying dataset.

2-s2.0-84866331508,Conference Paper,"We recently developed the Image-Charge Solvation Model (ICSM), which is an explicit/implicit hybrid model to accurately account for long-range electrostatic forces inmolecular dynamics simulations [Lin et al., J. Chem. Phys., 131, 154103, 2009]. The ICSM has a productive spherical volume within the simulation cell for which key physical properties of bulk water are reproduced, such as density, radial distribution function, diffusion constants and dielectric properties. Although the reaction field (RF) is essential, it typically accounts for less than 2% of the total electrostatic force on a water molecule. This observation motivates investigating further the role of the RF within the ICSM. In this report we focus on distributions of forces and torques on water molecules as a function of distance from the origin and make extensive tests over a range of model parameters where Coulomb forces are decomposed into direct interactions from waters modeled explicitly and the RF. Molecular torques due to the RF typically account for 20% of the total torque, revealing why the RF plays an important role in the dielectric properties of simulated water. Moreover, it becomes clear that the buffer layer in the ICSM is essential to mitigate artifacts caused by the discontinuous change in dielectric constants at the explicit/implicit interface.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2013.0

The purpose was to examine the effects of short-term unilateral immobilization on the structural and mechanical properties of the patellar tendon in older men and younger men, in vivo. Methods: Eight older men and eight younger men underwent 14 days of unilateral immobilization. All individuals were assessed on both sides before and after the intervention. MRI was used to assess whole patellar tendon dimensions. The mechanical properties of the patellar tendon were assessed using simultaneous force and ultrasonographic measurements during isometric ramp contractions. Findings: In older men, tendon stiffness [Pre: mean 2949 (SD 799) vs. Post: mean 2366 (SD 774) N mm- 1, P &lt; 0.01] and Young's Modulus [Pre: mean 1.2 (SD 0.3) vs. Post: mean 1.0 (SD 0.3) GPa, P &lt; 0.05] declined with immobilization on the immobilized side.

For children insured by Medicaid, these visits are called Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT). These visits are designed to promote physical, emotional, and cognitive health. Six visits are recommended for the first year of life, 3 for the second year. We hypothesized that children with the recommended visits in the first 2 years of life would be more likely than others to be ready for school when they finish kindergarten. Methods: We studied children insured by Medicaid in South Carolina, born during 2000 through 2002 (n = 21,998). Measures included the number of EPSDT visits in the first 2 years of life and an assessment of school readiness conducted at the end of kindergarten. We used logistic regression to examine the adjusted association between having the recommended visits and school readiness, controlling for characteristics of mothers, infants, prenatal care and delivery, and residence area. Results: Children with the recommended visits had 23% higher adjusted odds of being ready for school than those with fewer visits. Conclusion: EPSDT may contribute to school readiness for children insured by Medicaid. Children having fewer than the recommended EPSDT visits may benefit from school readiness programs.",CHHS,Public Health,2012.0

Changes in laws led to racial integration of sports teams and equal athletic opportunities for girls. Yet, racial and gender gaps in playing sports persist, and intersections between race and gender, as well as different contexts of participation, may contribute to the gaps. This article uses structural resource and racial competition theories to examine the interactions among race, gender, and school environment to determine whether racial gaps persist for boys and girls and whether individual and school-level factors account for gender-specific racial gaps in sports participation. We combine data on every ninth-grade student in North Carolina public schools with data from school yearbooks and find that racial gaps in playing sports differ by gender, and that school factors-including opportunities schools provide to play sports-have unique influences on racial gaps for boys and girls.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Sociology,2012.0

Identifying active IP addresses in a target domain is a precursory step for many attacks. Frequently changing hosts' IP addresses is a novel proactive moving target defense (MTD) that hides network assets from external/internal scanners. In this paper, we use OpenFlow to develop a MTD architecture that transparently mutates host IP addresses with high unpredictability and rate, while maintaining configuration integrity and minimizing operation overhead. The presented technique is called OpenFlow Random Host Mutation (OF-RHM) in which the OpenFlow controller frequently assigns each host a random virtual IP that is translated to/from the real IP of the host. The real IP remains untouched, so IP mutation is completely transparent for end-hosts. Named hosts are reachable via the virtual IP addresses acquired via DNS, but real IP addresses can be only reached by authorized entities. Our implementation and evaluation show that OF-RHM can effectively defend against stealthy scanning, worm propagation, and other scanning-based attack.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2012.0

However, business activities can have a disproportionately harmful impact on the natural environments in which the BoP live and work.

2-s2.0-84866524866,Article,"Background: Sporadic Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (sALS) is a devastating, complex disease of unknown etiology. We studied this disease with microarray technology to capture as much biological complexity as possible. The Affymetrix-focused BaFL pipeline takes into account problems with probes that arise from physical and biological properties, so we adapted it to handle the long-oligonucleotide probes on our arrays (hence LO-BaFL). The revised method was tested against a validated array experiment and then used in a meta-analysis of peripheral white blood cells from healthy control samples in two experiments. We predicted differentially expressed (DE) genes in our sALS data, combining the results obtained using the TM4 suite of tools with those from the LO-BaFL method. Those predictions were tested using qRT-PCR assays.Results: LO-BaFL filtering and DE testing accurately predicted previously validated DE genes in a published experiment on coronary artery disease (CAD). Filtering healthy control data from the sALS and CAD studies with LO-BaFL resulted in highly correlated expression levels across many genes. After bioinformatics analysis, twelve genes from the sALS DE gene list were selected for independent testing using qRT-PCR assays. High-quality RNA from six healthy Control and six sALS samples yielded the predicted differential expression for 7 genes: TARDBP, SKIV2L2, C12orf35, DYNLT1, ACTG1, B2M, and ILKAP. Four of the seven have been previously described in sALS studies, while ACTG1, B2M and ILKAP appear in the context of this disease for the first time. Supplementary material can be accessed at: http://webpages.uncc.edu/~cbaciu/LO-BaFL/supplementary_data.html.Conclusion: LO-BaFL predicts DE results that are broadly similar to those of other methods. The small healthy control cohort in the sALS study is a reasonable foundation for predicting DE genes. Modifying the BaFL pipeline allowed us to remove noise and systematic errors, improving the power of this study, which had a small sample size. Each bioinformatics approach revealed DE genes not predicted by the other; subsequent PCR assays confirmed seven of twelve candidates, a relatively high success rate.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2012.0

For image set of a specific category or a mixture of multiple categories, we have built a sparsity model to reconstruct all its images by using a subset of most representative images (i.e., image summary); and we adopted the simulated annealing algorithm to learn such sparse dictionary by minimizing an explicit optimization function.

Two studies were conducted to investigate whether administrator-initiated retesting of flagged individuals represents a viable response to managing intentional distortion on personality questionnaires. We explored the effectiveness of retesting by considering whether retest responses are more accurate representations of a flagged individual's personality characteristics. A comparison of retest scores to a baseline measure of personality indicated that such scores were more accurate. Retesting should only work as a strategy for dealing with intentional distortion when individuals choose to respond more accurately the second time.

2-s2.0-84866841728,Article,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is characterized by defective mucociliary clearance and chronic airway infection by a complex microbiota. Infection, persistent inflammation and periodic episodes of acute pulmonary exacerbation contribute to an irreversible decline in CF lung function. While the factors leading to acute exacerbations are poorly understood, antibiotic treatment can temporarily resolve pulmonary symptoms and partially restore lung function. Previous studies indicated that exacerbations may be associated with changes in microbial densities and the acquisition of new microbial species. Given the complexity of the CF microbiota, we applied massively parallel pyrosequencing to identify changes in airway microbial community structure in 23 adult CF patients during acute pulmonary exacerbation, after antibiotic treatment and during periods of stable disease. Over 350,000 sequences were generated, representing nearly 170 distinct microbial taxa. Approximately 60% of sequences obtained were from the recognized CF pathogens Pseudomonas and Burkholderia, which were detected in largely non-overlapping patient subsets. In contrast, other taxa including Prevotella, Streptococcus, Rothia and Veillonella were abundant in nearly all patient samples. Although antibiotic treatment was associated with a small decrease in species richness, there was minimal change in overall microbial community structure. Furthermore, microbial community composition was highly similar in patients during an exacerbation and when clinically stable, suggesting that exacerbations may represent intrapulmonary spread of infection rather than a change in microbial community composition. Mouthwash samples, obtained from a subset of patients, showed a nearly identical distribution of taxa as expectorated sputum, indicating that aspiration may contribute to colonization of the lower airways. Finally, we observed a strong correlation between low species richness and poor lung function. Taken together, these results indicate that the adult CF lung microbiome is largely stable through periods of exacerbation and antibiotic treatment and that short-term compositional changes in the airway microbiota do not account for CF pulmonary exacerbations.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2012.0

Existing genomic analysis tools are often organized around literal views of genomes as linear strings. Even when information is highly condensed, these views grow cumbersome as larger numbers of genomes are added. Data aggregation and summarization methods from the field of visual analytics can provide abstracted comparative views, suitable for sifting large multi-genome datasets to identify critical similarities and differences. We introduce a software system for visual analysis of comparative genomics data. The system automates the process of data integration, and provides the analysis platform to identify and explore features of interest within these large datasets. GenoSets borrows techniques from business intelligence and visual analytics to provide a rich interface of interactive visualizations supported by a multi-dimensional data warehouse. In GenoSets, visual analytic approaches are used to enable querying based on orthology, functional assignment, and taxonomic or user-defined groupings of genomes. GenoSets links this information together with coordinated, interactive visualizations for both detailed and high-level categorical analysis of summarized data. GenoSets has been designed to simplify the exploration of multiple genome datasets and to facilitate reasoning about genomic comparisons. Case examples are included showing the use of this system in the analysis of 12 Brucella genomes. GenoSets software and the case study dataset are freely available at http://genosets.uncc.edu.

Background: Reasons for medication noncompliance are multifactorial-often related to health system, patient, condition, therapy, and socioeconomic factors. Methods: The analytical cross-sectional survey used a simple random sample of patients aged 18 and over who had undergone percutaneous coronary artery intervention with drug-eluting stent from 2006 to 2008 (n = 271) at Nork Marash Medical Center, Yerevan, Armenia. Medication noncompliance was assessed using the Morisky Adherence Scale. Patient satisfaction items were selected from the Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (PSQ-18). Results: Respondents' mean age was 57.5 ± 9.8 years. Most (87.8%) were male. Nearly one-third of patients (31.0%) were noncompliant. Most reported good health (91.9%). Respondents most often cited out-of-pocket costs as a reason for noncompliance (19.2%). Age, gender, health status, smoking status, and cost were associated with medication noncompliance (P < 0.05). Noncompliance was not associated with elapsed time after the intervention or satisfaction (P > 0.05). Medication noncompliance was positively related to cost (odds ratio [OR]= 2.57, 95% CI = 1.33-4.97) and inversely related to health status (OR = 0.46, 95% CI = 0.25-0.85) and age (OR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.91-0.97).

2-s2.0-84867142070,Article,"Land developers in select economic environments have been found to build in large increments and hold substantial amounts of inventory despite their ability to mitigate risk by phasing the production of residential lots. Such behavior was observed in numerous metropolitan areas throughout the southeastern and southwestern United States in the years leading up to financial crises, resulting in inventories of tens of thousands of lots in cities such as Atlanta, Las Vegas and Orlando, just to name a few. The model presented in this paper explores the rationale behind the choices made by developers in these markets and others by extending the real options framework to concurrently estimate optimal phasing and inventory decisions for large-scale residential development projects. Modeled interactions between several variables indicate that full development, smooth phased development and lumpy development can all be optimal under different market conditions, with each pattern feeding back into inventory levels and lot pricing.",Business,Finance,2012.0

Here, we identify the intestinal microbiota as a target of inflammation that affects the progression of CRC. High-throughput sequencing revealed that inflammation modifies gut microbial composition in colitis-susceptible interleukin-10 - deficient (Il10 -/-) mice. Monocolonization with the commensal Escherichia coli NC101 promoted invasive carcinoma in azoxymethane (AOM) - treated Il10-/- mice. Deletion of the polyketide synthase ( pks) genotoxic island from E. coli NC101 decreased tumor multiplicity and invasion in AOM/Il10-/- mice, without altering intestinal inflammation. Mucosa-associated pks+ E. coli were found in a significantly high percentage of inflammatory bowel disease and CRC patients. This suggests that in mice, colitis can promote tumorigenesis by altering microbial composition and inducing the expansion of microorganisms with genotoxic capabilities.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2012.0

The strategic planning processes used at three North Carolina community colleges reflect a balanced approach to responding to the accountability requirements of all three perspectives. Using a qualitative multisite case study of the colleges, five themes emerge as implications for practice: (a) Involve stakeholders in strategic planning and implementation; (b) Create a student-centered culture; (c) Provide fiscal accountability with data-driven decision making; (d) Develop a balanced strategic approach to all accountability perspectives; and (e) Integrate regional accreditation principles into strategies.

We find no team-level advantage in NHL shootouts for either the first shooting, second shooting, or home team, suggesting that the influence of pressure is not consistent across the two sports of hockey and soccer. However, shot level analysis indicates that on average there is an advantage to shooting second, or equivalently, a disadvantage to being the second goalkeeper.

Here we explore tradeoffs between potential gains in mapping accuracy with computational costs by integrating structural and intensity surface models extracted from LiDAR data with Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery and evaluating the degree to which TM, LiDAR, and LiDAR-TM fusion data discriminated land covers in the rapidly urbanizing region of Charlotte, North Carolina, USA. Using supervised maximum likelihood (ML) and classification tree (CT) methods, we classified TM data at 30. m and LiDAR data and LiDAR-TM fusions at 1. m, 5. m, 10. m, 15. m and 30. m resolutions. We assessed the relative contributions of LiDAR structural and intensity surface models to classification map accuracy and identified optimal spatial resolution of LiDAR surface models for large-area assessments of urban land cover. ML classification of 1. m LiDAR-TM fusions using both structural and intensity surface models increased total accuracy by 32% compared to LiDAR alone and by 8% over TM at 30. m. Fusion data using all LiDAR surface models improved class discrimination of spectrally similar forest, farmland, and managed clearings and produced the highest total accuracies at 1. m, 5. m, and 10. m resolutions (87.2%, 86.3% and 85.4%, respectively). At all resolutions of fusion data and using either ML or CT classifier, the relative contribution of the LiDAR structural surface models (canopy height and normalized digital surface model) to classification accuracy is greater than the intensity surface. Our evaluation of tradeoffs between data volume and thematic map accuracy for this study system suggests that a spatial resolution of 5. m for LiDAR surface models best balances classification performance and the computational challenges posed by large-area assessments of land cover.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2012.0

We engaged the voices of 10 university students living with learning disabilities through a series of semi-structured interviews. These students offered a variety of statements on the ways that their disabilities were accommodated or not by their instructors. We classified these perceptions into three kinds of accommodation perceived by university students with learning disabilities: non-accommodation, formal accommodation and accommodation for all students.

Objective: To examine the influence of a home-delivered Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) meal intervention on body mass index (BMI), energy consumed, and percent of energy needs consumed. Design: A 1-year randomized control trial of home-delivered DASH meals and medical nutrition therapy conducted from 2003 through 2005. Participants who received DASH meals were compared with those who did not receive meals. Data were collected in participants' homes at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. Participants/setting: The study sample was composed of 298 adults aged >60 years with hypertension and/or hyperlipidemia residing in a county in the southeastern part of North Carolina. Intervention: Participants in the meals intervention group received seven frozen meals per week for 1 year. The meals were designed to meet one third of participants' energy and nutrient needs and to comply with the DASH diet. Main outcome measures: Change in BMI, energy consumed, and percent of energy needs consumed. Statistical analyses performed: Difference-in-differences models were used to estimate the effects of the meal intervention on BMI, energy consumed, and percent of daily energy needs consumed. Analyses were conducted among the full sample and by subgroup (ie, race, income, and baseline obesity status). Results: In the full sample, receipt of meals did not have a significant effect on BMI, energy consumed, or percent of daily energy needs consumed. Among those living at or above the 165% poverty threshold, receipt of home-delivered meals was significantly associated with a decrease in energy consumed and, therefore, percent of daily energy needs consumed.

2-s2.0-84868143657,Conference Paper,"The demand-side energy management is crucial to optimize the energy usage with its production cost, so that the price paid by the users is minimized, while it also satisfies the demand. The recent proposed solutions leverage the two- way communication infrastructure provided by modern smart- meters. The demand management problem assumes that users can shift their energy usage from peak hours to off-peak hours with the goal of balancing the energy usage. The scheduling of the energy consumption is often formulated as a game- theoretic problem, where the players are the users and their strategies are the load schedules of their household appliances. The Nash equilibrium of the formulated game provides the global optimal performance (i.e., the minimum energy costs). To provide a distributed solution the users require to share their usage information with the other users to converge to the Nash equilibrium. Hence, this open sharing among users introduces potential privacy and security issues. In addition, the existing solutions assume that all the users are rational and truthful. In this paper, we first highlight the privacy and security issues involved in the distributed demand management protocols. Secondly, we propose an efficient clustering based multi-party computation (MPC) distributed protocol that enables users to share their usage schedules and at the same time preserve their privacy and confidentiality.

2-s2.0-84868222709,Article,"In this paper, we develop a newsvendor model in which the retailer gives ""free"" gift cards to consumers who purchase a regularly priced product at the end of the selling season instead of discounting the product. The model is developed for a market with patient consumers. We derive the sufficient optimality condition for the retailer's stocking level in the first period and the optimal gift card value in the second period. We also investigate the conditions under which giving gift cards results in higher expected profits than discounting the product. We find that five factors determine the effectiveness of gift cards. The first three factors are consumers' valuation per $1 of gift card, gift card redemption rates, and the average gross margin of the retailer. The last two factors are the degree to which consumers use gift cards to pay for products which they would have purchased from the retailer in the future with cash, and the additional spending above the gift card value consumers make when they redeem the card. The last two factors have a strong interaction. We also find that gift cards can be profitable when patient consumers consistently value each $1 by their redemption probability, even with 100% redemption. Numerical analysis shows that in the presence of patient consumers, increases in the redemption rate may lead to an increase in the expected profit. Similar counter-intuitive behavior of the expected profit occurs with changes in other problem parameters. The analysis also shows that gift cards' profit advantage over discounting increases with the variability of demand. The analysis also indicates that gift cards are most effective for low to medium priced products sold by high margin retailers.",Business,BISOM,2013.0

Results for the 83 completers revealed that overweight/obese students (N = 28) experienced greater gains in weight (p < 0.05), BMI (p < 0.05), and a trend towards increased WCs (p < 0.06) across the first college semester relative to their underweight/normal weight peers (N = 55).

Methods: The Brief Alcohol Screening and Intervention for College Students (BASICS) brief motivational interviewing (BMI) intervention was implemented at a public university as a 3-year programme designed to reduce underage drinking among freshmen with a secondary focus on PU. Participants were 299 freshmen from a state-supported university. Participants attended baseline visit, 2-week, 3-and 6-month visits. Analysis: Paired t-tests were used to determine the differences between alcohol consumption at different time points. McNemar's test was used to compare correlated proportions. Results: At the baseline, 30 of the participants were drinking and using illicit drugs, compared with 25 at the sixth month visit. Conclusion: The findings suggest that a decrease in alcohol consumption will also reduce the probability of PU. These findings can assist in developing health professional strategies for effective use of BMI interventions aimed at alcohol and PU.",CHHS,Nursing,2012.0

The purpose of this review was to determine the clinical significance of patient-reported outcomes from yoga interventions conducted with cancer survivors. A total of 25 published yoga intervention studies for cancer survivors from 20042011 had patient-reported outcomes, including quality of life, psychosocial or symptom measures. Thirteen of these studies met the necessary criteria to assess clinical significance. Clinical significance for each of the outcomes of interest was examined based on 1 standard error of the measurement, 0.5 standard deviation, and relative comparative effect sizes and their respective confidence intervals. This review describes in detail these patient-reported outcomes, how they were obtained, their relative clinical significance and implications for both clinical and research settings. Overall, clinically significant changes in patient-reported outcomes suggest that yoga interventions hold promise for improving cancer survivors' well-being. This research overview provides new directions for examining how clinical significance can provide a unique context for describing changes in patient-reported outcomes from yoga interventions.

This study identified the set of predictors of fair/poor self-rated health in adult female and male populations of Armenia during a period of long-lasting socio-economic transition to a market economy. Methods. Differences in self-rated health were analyzed along three dimensions: socioeconomic, behavioral/attitudinal, and psychosocial. The study utilized data from a 2006 nationwide household health survey that used a multi-stage probability proportional to size cluster sampling with a combination of interviewer- administered and self-administered surveys. Both female and male representatives of a household aged 18 and over completed the self-administered survey. Multivariate odds ratios (OR) for fair/poor self-rated health were calculated for different sets of variables and logistic regression models fitted separately for women and men to identify the determinants of fair/poor self-rated health. Results: Overall, 2310 women and 462 men participated in the survey. The rate of fair/poor self-rated health was 61.8% among women and 59.7% among men. For women, the set of independent predictors of fair/poor self-rated health included age, unemployment, poverty, low affordability of healthcare, depression, and weak social support. For men, the set included age, lower education, depression, weak social support, and drinking alcohol less than once a week. For both genders, depression and weak social support demonstrated the strongest independent association with fair/poor self-rated health. Conclusions: The prevalence of fair/poor self-rated health was similar among men and women in this study, but the sets of independent predictors of perceived health differed somewhat, possibly, reflecting lifestyle differences between men and women in Armenia. Nevertheless, psychosocial variables were the strongest predictors of fair/poor self-rated health for both genders, indicating the importance of improving the country's psychosocial environment through social reforms and poverty reduction.",CHHS,Public Health,2012.0

Total daily physical activity needs to include both in and out of school physical activity. METHODS: A secondary data analysis was performed on 1306 children drawn from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics Child Development Supplement (CDS III, 2007). The dependent variable in this study was BMI percentile, while the independent variable was physical activity. The multinomial logistic regression model was used to assess the associations between physical activity and BMI percentile controlling for age, gender, race/ethnicity, parental income, and neighborhood safety. RESULTS: Children who engaged in low daily physical activity levels had 1.8 times the odds of being obese versus normal weight than those who engaged in moderate levels [odds ratio (OR) = 1.80, confidence interval (CI) = 1.31, 2.48]. African-American children had 1.6 times the odds of being obese than normal weight (OR = 1.55, CI = 0.99, 2.43) and Hispanic children had approximately 1.8 times the odds of being obese than normal weight in comparison to non-Hispanic white children (OR = 1.79, CI = 1.00, 3.21).

This study sought to understand hospital-level variation in the percentage of admissions originating in the ED. Basic Procedures: This was a retrospective, cross-sectional analysis of 5 748 375 ED visits and 2 265 478 inpatient discharge occurring in 192 short-term acute Florida hospitals in calendar year 2005. Main Findings: Hospitals with increasing percentages of patients admitted through the ED are smaller in scale with fewer admissions, beds, and smaller medical staffs but admit a higher percentage of their ED visits to the hospital. Patients in these hospitals are increasingly Hispanic, older, Medicare insured, and likely to represent a preventable ambulatory sensitive condition. Conclusions: The increasing rate of admissions from the ED department is a national trend, but there is substantial variation at the hospital level. In Florida, measures of hospital scale and an older population with some limitations in access to, or the quality of, primary care are the factors influencing hospital-level variation. Factors implicated in increased ED use such as ED visit acuity, lack of insurance, and race are not important contributory variables.

This paper tests hypotheses about the relationship between volunteering and four specific life events-the birth of a child, divorce, widowhood, and the death of another household member. I find that having a child decreases a person's likelihood of volunteering and hours spent in volunteer work. Divorced males were more likely to volunteer and to increase the number of hours volunteered when compared to divorced females. Divorcees with children are also more likely to volunteer and increase the number of hours spent volunteering. Thus, gender and the presence of children in the home are important pathways to volunteering for divorced individuals. Overall, being widowed decreases the likelihood of volunteering and volunteering hours, but older widows tend to increase their volunteering activities.

The purpose of this study was to examine the changes in COPD costs over 20 years and assess total direct cost trends over the last 10. Methods: A cross-sectional study of a population-based survey (2007 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey compared to the 1987 National Medical Expenditures Panel Survey) of respondents aged 40 and older with COPD (ICD-9-CM codes 491.xx, 492.xx, or 496.xx) was assessed for demographic and healthcare services use characteristics and compared to reported statistics from 1987. Ten-year trends in total direct medical costs from 1997-2007 are presented. Results: In 2007, there were 416 survey respondents with COPD compared to 228 in 1987. In 1987, women were only 39% of the COPD sample, while in 2007 they made up 58% of the sample. Mean cost per COPD patient was $16,135 (2007 dollars) in 2007, which was up from $11,807 (2007 dollars) in 1987 or a 37% increase. The proportional cost of emergency department visits (183%) and prescription drugs (170%) from 1987-2007 was high compared to other healthcare services. However, the mean cost of a hospitalization was the highest actual increase ($2289). Ten-year trends show a similar gradual increase. Conclusions: The prevalence of COPD among females as well as the mean cost per COPD patient has risen sharply over the last 20 years. Cost-shifting from acute services to preventive services may allow US payers and healthcare providers to improve care and better manage costs for patients with COPD.

Results reveal that the factors affecting approval of state grants differ from those influencing approval of national grants. When a mayor's political party is aligned with that of the governor, municipalities tend to secure more state, but not national, grants. Municipal features, such as population, local revenues and divided government, positively influence national, but not state grants.

2-s2.0-84870247727,Article,"In this paper, a novel approach is developed to achieve automatic image collection summarization. The effectiveness of the summary is reflected by its ability to reconstruct the original set or each individual image in the set. We have leveraged the dictionary learning for sparse representation model to construct the summary and to represent the image. Specifically we reformulate the summarization problem into a dictionary learning problem by selecting bases which can be sparsely combined to represent the original image and achieve a minimum global reconstruction error, such as MSE (Mean Square Error). The resulting Sparse Least Square problem is NP-hard, thus a simulated annealing algorithm is adopted to learn such dictionary, or image summary, by minimizing the proposed optimization function. A quantitative measurement is defined for assessing the quality of the image summary by investigating both its reconstruction ability and its representativeness of the original image set in large size. We have also compared the performance of our image summarization approach with that of six other baseline summarization tools on multiple image sets (ImageNet, NUS-WIDE-SCENE and Event image set).

Problem In response to documented medical training deficits, the American University of Armenia organized a first aid training course (FATC) for primary health care providers within the scope of the USAID-funded Humanitarian Assistance Project in Nagorno Karabagh. This paper reports the follow-up assessments conducted to inform policy makers regarding FATC knowledge and skill retention and the potential need for periodic refresher training. Methods Follow-up assessments were conducted six months and 18 months following the FATC to assess the retention of knowledge, attitudes, and self-reported practices. Eighty-four providers participated in the first follow-up and 210 in the second. The assessment tool contained items addressing the use and quality of the first aid skills, trainee's evaluation of the course, and randomly selected test questions to assess knowledge retention. Results At both follow-up points, the participants' assessment of the course was positive. More than 85% of the trainees self-assessed their skills as ""excellent"" or ""good"" and noted that skills were frequently practiced. Scores of approximately 58% on knowledge tests at both the first and second follow-ups indicated no knowledge decay between the first and second survey waves, but substantial decline from the immediate post-test assessment in the classroom.

Design of decoupling algorithms is a challenging topic due to the uncertainty of coupling errors. The conventional nonlinear decoupling algorithms by a standard Neural Network (NN) are sometimes unstable due to overfitting. In order to avoid overfitting and minimize the negative effect of random noises and gross errors in calibration data, we propose a novel nonlinear static decoupling algorithm based on the establishment of a coupling error model. Instead of regarding the whole system as a black box in conventional algorithm, the coupling error model is designed by the principle of coupling errors, in which the nonlinear relationships between forces and coupling errors in each dimension are calculated separately. Six separate Support Vector Regressions (SVRs) are employed for their ability to perform adaptive, nonlinear data fitting. The decoupling performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with the conventional method by utilizing obtained data from the static calibration experiment of a 3-axis force sensor.

To illustrate these notions, we provide an in-depth review of 163 multi-level empirical leader-member exchange (LMX) and vertical dyad linkage (VDL) studies published between 1972 and 2012. Our findings indicate that the volume of multi-level studies in LMX has drastically increased recently and the majority of these studies cast theory and hypotheses at the same level. With regard to alignment of levels of theory/hypotheses with measurement and with data analyses, however, roughly one out of two published studies suffers from misalignment of levels. Most of this misalignment occurs in studies where the dyad level of analysis, a key component of LMX, is an explicit or implicit focus. We conclude with a discussion of the implications for the LMX literature, and present recommendations to guide multi-level leadership research.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Organizational Science,2012.0

The burgeoning field of landscape epidemiology integrates concepts and approaches from disease ecology with the macroscale lens of landscape ecology, enabling examination of disease across spatiotemporal scales in complex environmental settings. We review the state of the field and describe analytical frontiers that show promise for advancement, focusing on natural and human-altered ecosystems. Concepts fundamental to practicing landscape epidemiology are discussed, including spatial scale, static versus dynamic modeling, spatially implicit versus explicit approaches, selection of ecologically meaningful variables, and inference versus prediction. We highlight studies that have advanced the field by incorporating multiscale analyses, landscape connectivity, and dynamic modeling. Future research directions include understanding disease as a component of interacting ecological disturbances, scaling up the ecological impacts of disease, and examining disease dynamics as a coupled human-natural system.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2012.0

For making the SNP genotyping cost-effective, successful competitive allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (KASPar) assays were developed for 1616 SNPs and referred to as PKAMs (pigeonpea KASPar assay markers). Screening of PKAMs on 24 genotypes [23 from cultivated species and 1 wild species (Cajanus scarabaeoides)] defined a set of 1154 polymorphic markers (77.4%) with a polymorphism information content (PIC) value from 0.04 to 0.38. One thousand and ninety-four PKAMs showed polymorphisms between parental lines of the reference mapping population (C. cajan ICP 28 × C. scarabaeoides ICPW 94). By using high-quality marker genotyping data on 167 F2 lines from the population, a comprehensive genetic map comprising 875 PKAMs with an average inter-marker distance of 1.11 cM was developed. Previously mapped 35 simple sequence repeat markers were integrated into the PKAM map and an integrated genetic map of 996.21 cM was constructed. Mapped PKAMs showed a higher degree of synteny with the genome of Glycine max followed by Medicago truncatula and Lotus japonicus and least with Vigna unguiculata. These PKAMs will be useful for genetics research and breeding applications in pigeonpea and for utilizing genome information from other legume species.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2012.0

Specifically, our approach extracts key data features as virtual words and uses them to encode various data properties. The distributions of virtual words across time are further applied to study various temporal relationships by generating time lines, which renders sampled time steps as points and temporal sequence as a line. Our approach consists of the three following components. First, we select feature points and collect feature descriptors to build a space of data properties, where virtual words are extracted as representative vectors. Second, the virtual words are applied to characterize feature points and their distribution statistics are used to measure temporal relationships. Third, we present several case studies to visualize time lines for different data visualization and analysis purposes. Our time line visualization can be used for both summarization and exploration of overall temporal relationships. We demonstrate with examples that time lines can serve as effective exploration, comparison, and visualization tools to study time-varying datasets.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2012.0

Most of these studies focus on the use of pure statistical approaches to assess the policy impact. A spatially explicit modeling framework is, however, often required to better assess the policy impact and to help understand the consequence of these policies. In this article, we developed such a spatially explicit modeling framework to assess the impact of policies on arable land loss and urban sprawl through the combination of counterfactual analysis with a scenario simulation approach. Counterfactual analysis provides support to assess the impact of farmland preservation policies, while scenario simulation enables us to generate counterfactual outcomes to capture possible land use patterns without policy intervention. With support from cellular automata, farmland preservation policies are integrated into the decision-making processes of land use conversion to link policy with scenario simulation. Our case study demonstrates the potential of the proposed modeling framework for the assessment of farmland preservation policies.

Methods: This was a group randomized controlled trial with 165 participants in two groups (intervention/control). Data were collected using self-reported questionnaires based upon HPM constructs (benefits and barriers of action, self-efficacy, activity-related affect, interpersonal influences, and situational influences). The stages of change scale was used to select eligible participants (were placed on precontemplation, contemplation, or preparation stages) and to assess the trend. After collecting baseline data, the intervention was administered to the participants and follow-up data was collected 3 months after intervention. Results: In all, 88 males and 77 females with a mean age of 13.99±0.4 participated in the study. The differences in all HPM constructs, except activity-related affect and social influences, were significant (p < 0.01) between baseline and follow-up measurements. Adolescents in the intervention as compared to the control group were placed in action (70%) or preparation (30%) stages at follow-up. Multiple regression analysis revealed that competing preferences, social norms, role models, (p < 0.001), and commitment to action plan can significantly predict PA behavior. The model accounted for 22.5% of the variance in PA. Conclusions: The results suggest that educational interventions based on stages of change can have important implications for improving PA among adolescents in more constructs of HPM.",CHHS,Public Health,2012.0

Statistical analyses show that multiple indicators of economic well-being exert a significant effect on self-perceived social status and status change and on subjective well-being. Positive status perceptions further enhance one's subjective well-being. Some of these effects are also moderated by contextual inequality. This study advances the literature by moving beyond income-based measures to examine the consequences of economic disparity. It also shows that status perceptions are the key nexus to probe the impacts of economic well-being and the sources of life satisfaction.

This study examined PTG and perceived growth in the absence of trauma among Japanese youth. A total of 408 youth (215 boys, 193 girls), with a mean age of 13.38 years (SD =.93), from one public junior high school in the suburbs of Tokyo were recruited. They reported whether they had experienced any trauma in the past year and completed measures assessing psychological growth using the Revised Posttraumatic Growth Inventory for Children, subjective severity, and cognitive processing using the adapted Rumination Scale. Results using one-way ANOVA showed that greater growth was reported by those who experienced trauma, and the objective severity of the adversity was reliably related to perceived growth. Chi-square tests revealed that those who did not experience adversity had more difficulty identifying growth. These results suggest that the youth-reported growth does not simply reflect normative maturation. Multiple regression analysis, using participants who reported at least one traumatic event, indicated that deliberate cognitive processing appears to play an important role in PTG.

Little is known about hospital use and costs across health insurance payer types. We examined hospitalizations and associated costs by sociodemographic characteristics and payer type during the first year of life among children with SB. We also examined changes in health insurance payer status. METHODS: This study was a retrospective, statewide population-based analysis of infants with SB without anencephaly born in Florida during 1998-2007. Infants were identified by the Florida Birth Defects Registry and linked to hospital discharge records. Descriptive statistics on number of hospitalizations, length of stay, and estimated hospital costs per hospitalization and per infant were calculated during the first year of life. Results were stratified by selected sociodemographic variables and health insurance payer type. RESULTS: Among 615 infants with SB, mean and median numbers of hospitalizations per infant were 2.4 and 2.0, respectively. Mean and median total days of hospitalization per infant were 25.2 and 14.0 days, respectively. Approximately 18% of infants were hospitalized more than three times. Among infants with multiple hospitalizations, 16.7% had a mix of public and private health insurance payers. Almost 60% of hospitalizations for infants were paid by public payer sources. Mean and median estimated hospital costs per infant were $39,059 and $21,937, respectively.

The consumers derive benefit from consuming content but suffer from delivery delays. A publisher's content provision strategy comprises two decisions: (a) the content quality (affecting consumption benefit) and (b) the content distribution delay (affecting consumption cost). The focus here is on how a publisher should choose the content provision strategy in the presence of a content pirate such as a peer-to-peer (P2P) network. Our study sheds light on how a publisher could leverage a pirate's presence to increase profits, even though the pirate essentially encroaches on the demand for the publisher's content. We find that a publisher should sometimes decrease the delivery speed but increase quality in the presence of a pirate (a quality focused strategy). At other times, a distribution focused strategy is better; namely, increase delivery speed, but lower quality. In most cases, however, we show that the publisher should improve at least one dimension of content provision (quality or delay) in the presence of a pirate.",Business,BISOM,2012.0

In this paper, we introduce a configuration-based constrained optimization method for solving this rendering problem. The six-dimensional configuration (position and orientation) of the graphic tool is defined as the solution variable of the optimization problem. Contact constraints are obtained based on identifying principal contacts between the graphic avatar of the haptic tool, called the graphic tool, and the virtual task environment. In order to maintain stability during contact switch, a hybrid method combining collision detection, local search and parallel optimization is introduced. Based on parallel optimization and selection of local solution, we can maintain the local solution of the optimization model. Our method has been validated in experiments of moving a convex tool to probe a narrow cavity with or without bulges. Force rendering is stable even when the free space is very small and involves fine features of objects. Non-penetration between the tool and the object forming the cavity are maintained under frequent contact switches.

Methods: This work included a longitudinal cohort recruited from Medicare-certified long-term care facilities across the United States. MDS data were collected from 52,996 residents (mean age 83.7 years). Structural equation modeling was used to build a measurement model of pain to test correlations between indicators and the fit of the model by cognitive status. The model evaluates the theoretical constructs of pain to improve how pain is assessed and detected within cognitive levels. Results: Using pain frequency and intensity as the only indicators of pain, the overall prevalence of pain was 31.2%; however, analysis by cognitive status showed that 47.7% of the intact group was in pain, while only 18.2% of the severely, 29.4% of the moderately, and 39.6% of the mildly cognitively impaired groups were experiencing pain. This finding supports previous research indicating that pain is potentially under-reported in severely cognitively impaired elderly nursing home residents. With adjustments to the measurement model, a revised format containing affective, behavioral, and inferred pain indicates a better fit of the data to include these domains, as a more complete measure of the pain construct. Conclusion: Pain has a significant effect on quality of life and long-term health outcomes in nursing home residents. Patients most at risk are those with mild to severe cognitive decline, or those unable to report pain verbally. Nursing homes are under great scrutiny to maintain standards of care and provide uniform high-quality care outcomes.

Given different types of interactions or constraints on interactions, a problem can appear to have different degrees of difficulty. While this relationship between interaction and problem solving has been well studied in the cognitive science literatures, the visual analytics community has yet to exploit this understanding for analytical problem solving. In this paper, we hypothesize that constraints on interactions and constraints encoded in visual representations can lead to strategies of varying effectiveness during problem solving. To test our hypothesis, we conducted a user study in which participants were given different levels of interaction constraints when solving a simple mathematic game called number scrabble. Number scrabble is known to have an optimal visual problem isomorph, and the goal of this study is to learn if and how the participants could derive the isomorph and to analyze the strategies that the participants utilize in solving the problem.

Evidence of an asymmetric substitution effect is also uncovered, whereby increasing organizational diversity in large CG commissions produces revenue forecasts that reduce collective accuracy by slightly more than three times as much compared to decreasing such diversity in small CG commissions.

However, using PXRF in circumstances where sample selection and preparation diverge from standards developed for lab-based instrumentation requires assessing the impact of new and potentially limiting factors to establish the validity of the method in these new contexts. Here we examine the effects of surface contamination and chemical weathering on the ability to assess provenance of igneous building stones used in the Cuzco region of Peru. Surface contamination was assessed through comparing low-impact cleaning methods on diorite and andesite blocks, and weathering was examined by comparing weathered vs. fresh surfaces of samples from two andesite quarries. In general, the lightest elements were most impacted by contamination and weathering while measurements of many of the heavier elements commonly used in provenance studies were relatively unaffected. Concentrations of Pb and Zn were problematic in the urban context of Cuzco because of pollution. Ability to determine provenance of building stones within those limitations (i.e., the validity of this application of PXRF) was demonstrated in a preliminary study by comparing measurements from uncleaned, exposed building stones in the region to fresh quarry samples.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Anthropology,2013.0

The fate of duplicated genes is poorly understood, both functionally and evolutionarily. Soybean (Glycine max L.) has undergone two separate polyploidy events (13 and 59 million years ago) that have resulted in 75% of its genes being present in multiple copies. It therefore constitutes a good model to study the impact of whole-genome duplication on gene expression. Using RNA-seq, we tested the functional fate of a set of approximately 18 000 duplicated genes. Across seven tissues tested, approximately 50% of paralogs were differentially expressed and thus had undergone expression subfunctionalization. Based on gene ontology and expression data, our analysis also revealed that only a small proportion of the duplicated genes have been neo-functionalized or non-functionalized. In addition, duplicated genes were often found in collinear blocks, and several blocks of duplicated genes were co-regulated, suggesting some type of epigenetic or positional regulation. We also found that transcription factors and ribosomal protein genes were differentially expressed in many tissues, suggesting that the main consequence of polyploidy in soybean may be at the regulatory level.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2013.0

Since the cooperative communication can reduce the transmission power and extend the transmission coverage, it has been considered in minimum energy routing protocols to reduce the total energy consumption. However, previous research on cooperative routing only focuses on minimizing the total energy consumption from the source node to the destination node, which may lead to the unbalanced energy distribution among nodes. In this paper, we aim to study the impact of cooperative routing on balancing the energy distribution among nodes. By introducing a new routing scheme which carefully selects cooperative relay nodes and assigns their transmission power, our cooperative routing method can balance the energy among neighboring nodes and maximize the remaining lifetime of the network.

This greatly impedes the ability of protocol verification tools to detect intricate attacks. In this paper, we establish a faithful view of the attacker based on rigorous, yet intuitive, interpretations of exchanged messages. This gives us a new way to look at attacks and protocol implementations. Specifically, we identify two types of attacks that can be thawed through adjusting the protocol implementation; and show that such an ideal implementation does not always exist. Overall, the obtained attacker's view provides a path to more secure protocol designs and implementations.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2012.0
2-s2.0-84872045627,Article,"Despite a growing recognition of the influence of gender in the policymaking arena, few scholars have studied the relationship between lawyer gender and decision making on appellate courts. This article examines this relationship in the context of the United States Courts of Appeals, where there have been a greater number of female judges for a longer period of time. The results of the analysis suggest that, in the average Courts of Appeals case, judges are generally more likely to side with female attorneys, even in the absence of a ""women's issue."" In addition, both male and female judges are equally supportive of female lawyers even when the circuit is not particularly gender diverse. However, circuit judges are less likely to support female attorneys in cases in which the circuit reverses the lower court, indicating a notable disadvantage for female advocates in the very cases in which advocacy might be most crucial at the circuit court level.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Political Science and Public Administration,2013.0

However, maintaining coverage is one of the most challenging tasks in configuring and deploying WSNs. Although there has been a significant amount research on providing coverage, most of the existing solutions focus on the coverage problem without giving attention to new sensing capabilities and dependability (security and reliability) requirements of WSN. Nevertheless, most of the existing techniques show limited scalability with the increasing number of sensors. In this paper, we present novel Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) based formalizations to find the satisfying coverage configurations considering various practical security and reliability constraints.

Non-invasive diagnosis of performance problems is the key capability for overlay service management in order to adapt to dynamic network conditions in a timely manner. Existing overlay diagnosis approaches assume extensive knowledge about the network, and require monitoring sensors or active measurements. In this paper, we propose a novel diagnosis technique to localize performance anomalies and determine the packet loss contribution for each network component. Our approach is purely based on endpoint packet loss observations to reason about the location of observed packet loss without active probing or sensor deployment. We formulate the problem as a constraint-satisfaction problem using constraints derived from network loss invariants and end-user observations. Our solution also circumvents the possibilities of insufficient or malicious end-user participation. We evaluate our approach extensively using simulation and experimentation, and demonstrate the accuracy, effectiveness and scalability of our approach for various network sizes, participation levels and spurious amounts.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2012.0

Design: Cross-sectional analysis using data from the 2008 North Carolina Child Health Assessment and Monitoring Program (NC CHAMP), a representative sample of adults who have land-line telephones. Setting: North Carolina. Participants: Families with children who participated in the NC CHAMP (n = 2,932). Main Outcome Measure: Frequency of buying local produce from local vendors in the past year. Analysis: Bivariate and multivariate zero-inflated negative binomial regression identified characteristics associated with not buying local produce and, among those who purchased local produce, the frequency of purchasing. Results: About half of families reported buying local produce on average once a month during the past year. In adjusted results, buying local produce was more likely among white families, lower income families, families living in rural areas, families with children who ate 5 or more servings of fruits and vegetables per day, and families with children in poor health.

Evolution has meant several things to different generations of Darwinians. Most of these versions of Darwinism are recognisable in hindsight as flawed in various ways. Today, as in the past, there are diverse and conflicting Darwinisms, vying for credibility in the marketplace of ideas. The best birthday present we can give Charles Darwin, I will argue, is a clear name. Human microevolution. Recent scholarship has shown that Darwin himself was strongly engaged with the political ideas of his age: as he was reading Lyell on the Beagle, the British were outlawing slavery in their colonies. The major evolutionary question of the era was not about dinosaurs or finches or tortoises, but about people (Livingstone, 2008; Desmond and Moore, 2009): were black people and white people the products of a single origin or creative act, or of different ones, of which the Bible only recounts the last?",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Anthropology,2011.0
2-s2.0-84872231118,Conference Paper,"The genomes of prokaryotes are dynamic and shuffling of gene order occurs frequently, along with horizontal transfer of genes from external sources. Local conservation of gene order tends to reflect functional constraints on the genome or on a biochemical subsystem. Comparison of the local gene neighborhoods surrounding a gene of interest gives insight into evolutionary history and functional potential of the gene. The Genomic Ring Visualization Tool (Gene-RiViT) is a high speed, intuitive visualization tool for investigating sequence environments of conserved genes among related genomes. Gene-RiViT allows the user to interact with interconnected global and local visualizations of gene neighborhoods and gene order, through a web-based interface that is easily accessible in any browser. The primary visualization is a wheel of nested rotating circles, each of which represents a single genome. This visualization is similar to common circular genome alignment views, except that the rings can be realigned with each other dynamically based on user selections within the ring view or one of the coordinated views. By allowing the user to dynamically realign genomes and focus on a locally conserved region of interest, and using or-thology connections to highlight corresponding structures among genomes, this view provides insight into gene context and preservation of neighbor relationships as genomes evolve. Visualizations are linked into a coordinated multiple view interface to provide multiple selection methods and entry points into the data. These approaches make Gene-RiViT a flexible, unique tool for examining gene neighborhoods that improves on existing methods.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2012.0

Medical homes are a model of primary health care that coordinate services to better meet the needs of the child. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between presence of medical home and missed school days among CSHCN. Methods: A secondary analysis of cross-sectional data from the 2005 National Survey of Children With Special Healthcare Needs (NS-CSHCN) was conducted. Multivariate ordinal logistic regression was done to analyze the relationship between presence of a medical home and number of missed school days. Results: The presence of a medical home among CSHCN was associated with being in the highest category of missed school days. The adjusted odds ratios for the number of missed school days, after adjustment for poverty, metropolitan statistical area status, education in the household, age, race and ethnicity, demonstrated that access to a medical home does not decrease school absences. Conclusion: Although the data did not support the hypothesis that CSHCN with a medical home would have fewer missed school days due to illness, this study does evoke future research questions, such as what is the relationship between parental perception of child health status with number of missed school days and how adequate is the communication between families and healthcare providers in the medical home.",CHHS,Public Health,2013.0

The major goal is to develop an analytical framework for understanding how place plays a role in ethnic entrepreneurship processes at different geographic scales. Design/methodology/approach: The article starts with a review of perspectives on ethnic entrepreneurship from multiple disciplines in social sciences, mainly from a non-spatial approach. It then critically discusses the spatial inquiries on ethnic entrepreneurship, with a focus on identifying the gaps across disciplines. Based on these discussions, a comprehensive, multilevel spatial framework is finally conceptualized. Following that, the concluding remarks highlight future directions and public policy significance by implementing this suggested social-spatial approach. Findings: As the central social actors, ethnic entrepreneurs weave through multiscaled geographic contexts in the process of creatively mobilizing and capitalizing entrepreneurial resources in the labor markets. The multiscaled geographic contexts provide a milieu of social, economic, political, cultural, and regulatory factors and forces. The interaction between the social actors and their social-spatial contexts further influences entrepreneurs' values of entrepreneurship, perception of entrepreneurial opportunities, practical management strategies, and ultimately their business performances. Practical implications: This study provides significant policy implications for entrepreneurship related public policies on regional development, economic recovery, and neighborhood revitalization especially when race and ethnicity are concerned. Originality/value: By identifying gaps of knowledge in ethnic entrepreneurship and incorporating a multidisciplinary literature, this paper extends the discussion of ""contextual effects"" from spatial dimensions, explicitly brings race and ethnicity to the spatial framework of entrepreneurship.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2013.0

We categorized these studies into three groups based on the type of subjects involved as follows: (1) healthy subjects, (2) subjects with chronic illnesses, and (3) subjects with depression. Based on the heterogeneity assessment of available studies, meta-analyses were conducted in three studies of patients with type II diabetes in the second group, which suggested that Qigong was effective in reducing depression (E S = - 0.29; 95% CI, -0.58-0.00) and anxiety (E S = - 0.37; 95% CI, -0.66-0.08), as measured by Symptom Checklist 90, and in improving psychological well-being (E S = - 0.58; 95% CI, -0.91-0.25) as measured by Diabetes Specific Quality of Life Scale. Overall, the quality of research methodology of existing studies was poor. Conclusions. Preliminary evidence suggests that Gigong may have positive effects on psychological well-being among patients with chronic illnesses. However the published studies generally had significant methodological limitations. More high-quality studies are needed.",CHHS,Social Work,2013.0

While some researchers have explored these institutional pathologies for published cases, the present piece extends our understanding in two ways. First, we introduce an empirical measure of judicial efficiency, ""swift justice,"" in terms of adjudicatory disposition time. Second, we examine the impact of particular institutional characteristics-whether a case is orally argued, or whether the decision is published-on judicial efficiency. We analyze the population of published and unpublished U.S. federal appellate decisions from 1976-97, using institutional variables to identify prescriptions that might attenuate pathologies of adjudicatory speed.

2-s2.0-84873413076,Conference Paper,"In this paper, a novel framework is developed for leveraging large-scale loosely tagged images for object classifier training by addressing three key issues jointly: (a) spam tags e.g., some tags are more related to popular query terms rather than the image semantics; (b) loose object tags, e.g., multiple object tags are loosely given at the image level without identifying the object locations in the images; (c) missing object tags, e.g., some object tags are missed and thus negative bags may contain positive instances. To address these three issues jointly, our framework consists of the following key components for leveraging large-scale loosely tagged images for object classifier training: (1) distributed image clustering and inter-cluster visual correlation analysis for handling the issue of spam tags by filtering out large amounts of junk images automatically, (2) multiple instance learning with missing tag prediction for dealing with the issues of loose object tags and missing object tags jointly; (3) structural learning for leveraging the inter-object visual correlations to train large numbers of inter-related object classifiers jointly.

2-s2.0-84873471892,Article,"Why does the discovery of oil lead to increased government repression in some countries and not others? Why is there variance in the extent to which democracy constrains state violations of human rights? We assume that an executive's propensity to use violence against citizens is a function of the extent to which he is dependent on his citizenry. Executives can be dependent on their citizenry in two ways: (1) at the bank for financial resources, and (2) at the ballot box for political support. We argue that these considerations jointly influence executive decisions to engage in state repression, and consequently, observed human rights abuse. Using a dataset of 146 countries from 1981 to 2011, we find that democratic institutions have a moderating effect on the positive relationship between unearned revenues and human rights violations. Decreased reliance on citizens for revenue does not weaken and may actually strengthen the pacifying effect of democratic institutions on state terror. Our results suggest that pursuing democracy is a useful way to reduce political violence, both directly and indirectly, even in the presence of a resource curse. Furthermore, the discovery of oil and other unearned revenues is unlikely to undermine the positive relationship between democratic institutions and domestic protections for human rights.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Political Science and Public Administration,2013.0

Such discrimination is not unique to South Korea. Because marital status and quality of life is significant for individuals with disabilities, this study examined factors associated with marital satisfaction among individuals with disabilities in South Korea using an existing data set. The sample included married individuals with disabilities, using data drawn from the 2008 Korean Disability Survey (N = 1,028; 507 women and 521 men). In this South Korean sample, major challenges to maintaining a happy marriage were related to financial demands such as securing sufficient household income, finding assistance in performing housework, and improving relational quality among family members. The study revealed interesting gender differences: For female respondents, structural factors of family and marriage-household income, housework, quality of family relations, and younger age at marriage-were significant. For their male peers, along with such structural factors, their health, activities, and quality of life were also significant.

Participants included 26 preservice science teachers enrolled in a 2-year Master of Teaching program. A specific program goal was to prepare teachers to use technology to support reform-based science instruction. To this end, the program integrated technology instruction across five courses and situated this instruction within the context of learning and teaching science. A variety of data sources were used to characterize the participants' intentions and instructional practices, including classroom observations, lesson plans, interviews, and written reflections. Data analysis followed a constant comparative process with the goal of describing if, how, and why the participants integrated technology into their instruction and the extent to which they applied, adapted, and innovated upon what they learned in the science teacher preparation program. Results indicate that all participants used technology throughout their student teaching for reform-based science instruction. Additionally, they used digital images, videos, animations, and simulations to teach process skills, support inquiry instruction, and to enhance student engagement in ways that represented application, adaptation, and innovation upon what they learned in the science teaching methods program. Participants cited several features of the science teacher preparation program that helped them to effectively integrate technology into their instruction. These included participating in science lessons in which technology was modeled in the context of specific instructional approaches, collaborating with peers, and opportunities for feedback and reflection after teaching lessons. The findings of this study suggest that situated learning theory may provide an effective structure for preparing preservice teachers to integrate technology in ways that support reform-based instruction.",Education,Reading and Elementary Education,2013.0

In this article, we summarize the social properties in DTNs, and provide a survey of recent social-based DTN routing approaches. To improve routing performance, these methods either take advantages of positive social characteristics such as community and friendship to assist packet forwarding or consider negative social characteristics such as selfishness.

The purpose of this paper is to advance research and theory on self-leadership by examining leader self-talk and its relationship to effectiveness and strain. Design/methodology/approach: In total, 189 senior executives' self-addressed, future-oriented letters were collected. The executives wrote these letters to themselves for their own personal development; thus, the language used represented a form of naturally occurring self-talk. Two types of self-talk were coded: constructive and dysfunctional. Supervisor and direct report ratings of leadership of others and creativity and self-ratings of job strain were collected. Findings: Extensive variability among leaders in constructive self-talk was found. Exemplars of constructive and dysfunctional self-talk are presented. Constructive self-talk positively related to effective leadership of others and creativity/originality as evaluated by subordinates and superiors and was negatively related to job strain. Dysfunctional self-talk related negatively to creativity/originality. Originality/value: In addition to illustrating the types of self-talk used by leaders, research is extended by providing some of the first empirical evidence of how leaders' free-flowing thoughts are related to their effectiveness and their overall well-being, lending direct support to a principal proposition from the self-leadership framework.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Psychology,2013.0

In particular, 73% of the CD4i antibodies and 100% of the PGT antibodies are encoded by potential VH replacement products. Such frequencies are significantly higher than those in IgH genes derived from HIV infected individuals or autoimmune patients. The identified VH replacement products encoding anti-HIV antibodies are highly mutated; the VH replacement ""footprints"" within CD4i antibodies preferentially encode negatively charged amino acids within the IgH CDR3; many IgH encoding PGT antibodies are likely generated from multiple rounds of VH replacement.

The problem of facilitating policy settings has attracted numerous access control, and human computer interaction researchers. The solutions proposed range from usable interfaces for policy settings to automated policy settings. We propose a fine grained policy recommendation system that is based on an iterative semi-supervised learning approach that uses the social graph propagation properties. Active learning and social graph properties were used to detect the most informative instances to be labeled as training sets. We implemented and tested our approach using real Facebook dataset.

2-s2.0-84874272542,Conference Paper,"Enabling accurate analysis of social network data while preserving differential privacy has been challenging since graph features such as clustering coefficient or modularity often have high sensitivity, which is different from traditional aggregate functions (e.g., count and sum) on tabular data. In this paper, we treat a graph statistics as a function f and develop a divide and conquer approach to enforce differential privacy. The basic procedure of this approach is to first decompose the target computation f into several less complex unit computations f1, ... , fm connected by basic mathematical operations (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), then perturb the output of each fi with Laplace noise derived from its own sensitivity value and the distributed privacy threshold εi, and finally combine those perturbed fi as the perturbed output of computation f. We examine how various operations affect the accuracy of complex computations. When unit computations have large global sensitivity values, we enforce the differential privacy by calibrating noise based on the smooth sensitivity, rather than the global sensitivity. By doing this, we achieve the strict differential privacy guarantee with smaller magnitude noise. We illustrate our approach by using clustering coefficient, which is a popular statistics used in social network analysis. Empirical evaluations show the developed divide and conquer approach outperforms the direct approach.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2012.0

The LVIIR model for CMI results from an integration of clinical experience with a review of the literature in four distinct areas: (1) studies of idiopathic multisymptom illness in the veteran population including two decades of research on Gulf War I veterans with CMI, (2) new evidence supporting the existence of chronic inflammatory responses to latent viral antigens and the effect these responses may have on the nervous system, (3) recent discoveries concerning the role of vitamin D in maintaining normal innate and adaptive immunity including suppression of latent viruses and regulation of the immune inflammatory response, and (4) the detrimental effects of extreme chronic repetitive stress (ECRS) on the immune and nervous systems. The LVIIR model describes the pathophysiology of a pathway to CMI and presents a new direction for the clinical assessment of CMI that includes the use of neurological signs from a physical exam, objective laboratory data, and a new proposed latent viral antigen-antibody imaging technique for the peripheral and central nervous system. The LVIIR model predicts that CMI can be treated by a focus on reversal of immune system impairment, suppression of latent viruses and their antigens, and healing of nervous system tissue damaged by chronic inflammation associated with latent viral antigens and by ECRS. In addition, the LVIIR model suggests that maintaining optimal serum 25 OH vitamin D levels will maximize immune system suppression of latent viruses and their antigens and will minimize immune system inflammation. This model also emphasizes the importance of decreasing ECRS to improve immune system function and to minimize nervous system injury from excess serum glucocorticoid levels. The proposed model supports growing evidence that increasing omega 3 essential fatty acid levels in nervous system tissues may decrease inflammation in the nervous system and improve neural plasticity and recovery from neuronal injury.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Psychology,2013.0
2-s2.0-84874541599,Conference Paper,"Exploiting static configuration of networks and hosts has always been a great advantage for design and launching of decisive attacks. Network reconnaissance of IP addresses and ports is prerequisite to many host and network attacks. At the same time, knowing IP addresses is required for service reachability in IP networks, which makes complete concealment of IP address for servers infeasible. In addition, changing IP addresses too frequently may cause serious ramifications including service interruptions, routing inflation, delays and security violations. In this paper, we present a novel approach that turns end-hosts into untraceable moving targets by transparently mutating their IP addresses in an intelligent and unpredictable fashion and without sacrificing network integrity, manageability or performance. The presented technique is called Random Host Mutation (RHM). In RHM, moving target hosts are assigned virtual IP addresses that change randomly and synchronously in a distributed fashion over time. In order to prevent disruption of active connections, the IP address mutation is managed by network appliances and totally transparent to end-host. RHM employs multi-level optimized mutation techniques that maximize uncertainty in adversary scanning by effectively using the whole available address range, while at the same time minimizing the size of routing tables, and reconfiguration updates. RHM can be transparently deployed on existing networks on end-hosts or network elements. Our analysis, implementation and evaluation show that RHM can effectively defend against stealthy scanning, many types of worm propagation and attacks that require reconnaissance for successful launching. We also show the performance bounds for moving target defense in a practical network setup.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2013.0

This metaregression analysis reviewed the social science literature published in the past 20 years on the relationship between mathematics outcomes and the racial composition of the K-12 schools students attend. The authors employed a two-level hierarchical linear model to analyze the 25 primary studies with 98 regression effects. Results indicate that school racial isolation has a small statistically significant negative effect on overall building-level mathematics outcomes. This relationship is moderated by the size of the sample in the study and by the way the independent variable was operationalized. Although it is small, the effect size is substantively meaningful. The effects are stronger in secondary compared to elementary grades, and racial gaps widen as students age. The emergence and widening of the race gaps as students move through the grades suggest that the association of racial segregation with mathematics performance compounds over time.

Students in all locations revealed culturally constructed meanings and beliefs in associated myths regarding HIV/AIDS. The process of viewing students of different cultures is illustrated as an effective pedagogical approach toward increasing students' global learning and could be replicated using discussion of other international challenges.",CHHS,Social Work,2012.0
2-s2.0-84874639401,Article,"Proenkephalin Peptide F [107-140] is an enkephalin-containing peptide found predominantly within the adrenal medulla, co-packaged with epinephrine within the chromaffin granules. In vivo studies indicate that Peptide F has classic opioid analgesia effects; in vitro studies suggest potential immune cell interactions. In this investigation we examined patterns of Peptide F concentrations in different bio-compartments of the blood at rest and following sub-maximal cycle exercise to determine if Peptide F interacts with the white blood cell (WBC) bio-compartment during aerobic exercise. Eight physically active men (n = 8) performed sub-maximal (80-85% V̇O2Speak) cycle ergometer exercise for 30 min. Plasma Peptide F and WBC Peptide F immunoreactivity were examined pre-exercise, mid-exercise and immediately post-, 5-min post-, 15-min post-, 30-min post- and 60-min post-exercise and at similar time-points during a control condition (30 min rest). Peptide F concentrations significantly (p &lt; 0.05) increased at 5 and 60 min post-exercise, compared to pre-exercise concentrations. No significant increases in Peptide F concentrations in the WBC fraction were observed during or after exercise. However, a significant decrease was observed at 30 min post-exercise. An ultradian pattern of Peptide F distribution was apparent during rest. Furthermore, concentrations of T cells, B cells, NK cells, and total WBCs demonstrated significant changes in response to aerobic exercise. Data indicated that Peptide F was bound in significant molar concentrations in the WBC fraction and that this biocompartment may be one of the tissue targets for binding interactions. These data indicate that Peptide F is involved with immune cell modulation in the white blood circulatory biocompartment of blood.",CHHS,Kinesiology,2013.0

2-s2.0-84874729951,Conference Paper,"We address a gap in the literature on civil competency by examining characteristics of those who undergo civil competency evaluations and how well Managing Money and Health and Safety subscales of the Independent Living Scales (ILS) predict legal competency adjudications. We were also interested whether these subscales are more accurate in making such predictions than the Mini-Mental State Examination and Trail-Making Test, Parts A and B, well-known measures of neuropsychological functioning. Actual legal competency decisions were obtained from public court records on 71 individuals with either mental retardation/borderline intellectual functioning (MR/BIF) or psychiatric, neurological, or combined psychiatric or neurological diagnoses. We found that those with neurological diagnoses performed significantly better on the Trail-Making Test, Part A, than the MR/BIF and combined neurological and psychiatric groups, and they demonstrated trends in the same direction for other measures. Both ILS subscales performed better than the cognitive measures, in terms of both hit rate and predictive value, in predicting ultimate judicial decision-making about competency.

The goal is to degrade the target's capacity to undertake political and violent action. We assess the effectiveness of drone strikes in achieving this goal, measuring degradation as the capacity of Al Qaeda to generate and disseminate propaganda. Propaganda is a key output of many terrorist organizations and a long-standing priority for Al Qaeda. Unlike other potential measures of terrorist group activity and capacity, propaganda output can be observed and measured. If drone strikes have degraded Al Qaeda, their occurrence should be correlated with a reduction in the organization's propaganda output. The analysis presented here finds little evidence that this is the case. Drone strikes have not impaired Al Qaeda's ability to generate propaganda.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Political Science and Public Administration,2013.0

We describe the construction of two phantoms, capable of respectively moving along a straight and a curved path. The phantoms are motorized so as to be able to move at a near constant speed. Experiments were performed at three speeds: 10, 15 and 20mm/sec, to simulate motion velocities during colonoscopy procedures. The average velocity error was within 3mm/sec in both straight and curved phantoms. Displacement error was within 7mm over a total distance of 288mm in the straight phantom, and less than 7mm over 287mm in the curved phantom.

Background/significance: Prior research has found that cognitive load mediates interpretation of a stimulus. In the presence of decreased cognitive capacity as with dementia, the relationship between cognition and increasing pain is unknown in the elderly. Patients and methods: Longitudinal cohort design. Data collected from the Minimum Data Set-Resident Assessment Instrument (MDS-RAI) from the 2001-2003 annual assessments of nursing home residents. A covariance model was used to evaluate the relationship between cognition and pain at three intervals. Results: The sample included 56,494 subjects from nursing homes across the United States, with an average age of 83 ± 8.2 years. Analysis of variance scores (ANOVAs) indicated a significant effect (P< 0.01) for pain and cognition, with protected t test revealing scores decreasing significantly with these two measures. Relative stability was found for pain and cognition over time. Greater stability was found in the cognitive measure than the pain measure. Cross-legged effects observed between cognition and pain measures were inconsistent. A concomitant relationship was not found between cognition and pain. Even though the relationship was significant at the 0.01 level, the correlations were low (r ≤ 0.08), indicating a weak association between cognition and pain. Conclusion: Understanding the concomitance of pain and cognition aids in defining additional frameworks to extend models to include secondary needs, contextual factors, and resident outcomes. Cognitive decline, as with organic brain diseases, is progressive. Pain is a symptom that can be treated and reduced to improve resident quality of life. However, cognition can be used to determine the most appropriate method to assess pain in the elderly, thereby improving accuracy of pain detection in this population.",CHHS,Nursing,2012.0

Their highly parallel and distributed structure makes them inherently suitable for parallel computing. As the technology of parallel and high-performance computing evolves and computing resources become more widely available, new opportunities exist for spatial neural network models to benefit from this advancement in terms of better handling computational and data intensity associated with spatial problems. In this study, we present a hybrid parallel ensemble neural network approach for modeling spatial land-use change. Our approach combines the shared-memory paradigm and the embarrassingly parallel method by leveraging the power of multicore computer clusters. The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated by the parallelization of Fuzzy ARTMAP neural network models, which have been extensively used in land-use modeling applications. We adopt an ensemble structure of neural networks to train multiple models in parallel and make use of the entire dataset simultaneously. We evaluate the proposed parallelization approach by examining performance variation of training datasets with alternative sizes. Experimental results reveal great potential of higher performance achievement when our hybrid parallel computing approach is applied to large spatial modeling problems.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2012.0

2-s2.0-84875338095,Article,"Porphyrins andmetalloporphyrins are the key pigments of life on earth as we know it, because they include chlorophyll (a magnesium-containing metalloporphyrin) and heme (iron protoporphyrin). In eukaryotes, porphyrins and heme are synthesized by a multistep pathway that involves eight enzymes. The first and rate-controlling step is the formation of delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) from glycine plus succinyl CoA, catalyzed by ALA synthase. Intermediate steps occur in the cytoplasm, with formation of the monopyrrole porphobilinogen and the tetrapyrroles hydroxymethylbilane and a series of porphyrinogens, which are serially decarboxylated. Heme is utilized chiefly for the formation of hemoglobin in erythrocytes, myoglobin in muscle cells, cytochromes P-450 and mitochondrial cytochromes, and other hemoproteins in hepatocytes. The rate-controlling step of heme breakdown is catalyzed by heme oxygenase (HMOX), of which there are two isoforms, called HMOX1 and HMOX2. HMOX breaks down heme to form biliverdin, carbon monoxide, and iron. The porphyrias are a group of disorders, mainly inherited, in which there are defects in normal porphyrin and heme synthesis. The cardinal clinical features are cutaneous (due to the skin-damaging effects of excess deposited porphyrins) or neurovisceral attacks of pain, sometimes with weakness, delirium, seizures, and the like (probably due mainly to neurotoxic effects of ALA). The treatment of choice for the acute hepatic porphyrias is intravenous heme therapy, which repletes a critical regulatory heme pool in hepatocytes and leads to downregulation of hepatic ALA synthase, which is a biochemical hallmark of all forms of acute porphyria in relapse.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2013.0

Over the years, many theoretical models have been developed to explain the stylized facts of U.S. Treasury yields; however, model comparison, parameter estimation and hypothesis testing remain thorny issues. The purpose of this paper is to show that Bayesian methods and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, in particular, may help resolve a number of these problems, especially those related to model comparison. We use MCMC to compare the seminal models of Vasicek and Cox, Ingersoll and Ross (CIR). The most surprising result of our analysis is that one of these two models is almost 50 000 times more likely than the other. In contrast, results in the previous literature have been much more ambiguous because they are based on a variety of goodness-of-fit measures. A Monte Carlo study shows that these results are not spurious: the MCMC method is able to select the correct data generation model, whereas goodness-of-fit measures are virtually indistinguishable regardless of whether the data were generated from Vasicek or CIR.",Business,Finance,2013.0

Methods: Data from 1104 adolescents aged 15 to 21 who completed the 2008 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth were analyzed. Information on family conflict (family fighting and family criticizing) and sexual behavior (number of sexual partners in past year and use of contraception at last intercourse) was self-reported. Logistic regression was used to obtain odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: After adjustment, adolescents whose family members often fought had increased odds of not using contraception at last intercourse and having two or more sexual partners in the past year (OR, 1.40 [95% CI, 1.04-1.88] and OR, 1.62 [95% CI, 1.23-2.14], respectively).

We performed an exploratory, blinded, retrospective analysis of plasma or serum samples collected as part of the trial to investigate the ability of VeriStrat (VS) to predict treatment outcomes. METHODS: Ninety-eight patients were assessable, and the majority had stage IV disease (81%), adenocarcinoma histology (63%), reported current or previous tobacco use (84%), and 26% had a performance status (PS) of 2. RESULTS: In arm A, patients with VS Good (n = 20) compared with VS Poor status (n = 8) had similar PFS (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.21; p = 0.67) and OS (HR: 0.82; p = 0.64).

2-s2.0-84875412687,Article,"The factors that account for the differences in the economic productivity of urban areas have remained difficult to measure and identify unambiguously. Here we show that a microscopic derivation of urban scaling relations for economic quantities vs. population, obtained from the consideration of social and infrastructural properties common to all cities, implies an effective model of economic output in the form of a Cobb-Douglas type production function. As a result we derive a new expression for the Total Factor Productivity (TFP) of urban areas, which is the standard measure of economic productivity per unit of aggregate production factors (labor and capital). Using these results we empirically demonstrate that there is a systematic dependence of urban productivity on city population size, resulting from the mismatch between the size dependence of wages and labor, so that in contemporary US cities productivity increases by about 11% with each doubling of their population. Moreover, deviations from the average scale dependence of economic output, capturing the effect of local factors, including history and other local contingencies, also manifest surprising regularities. Although, productivity is maximized by the combination of high wages and low labor input, high productivity cities show invariably high wages and high levels of employment relative to their size expectation. Conversely, low productivity cities show both low wages and employment. These results shed new light on the microscopic processes that underlie urban economic productivity, explain the emergence of effective aggregate urban economic output models in terms of labor and capital inputs and may inform the development of economic theory related to growth.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2013.0

Managers of Web 2.0 services need to quickly identify value-adding content and encourage the content contributors to keep supplying valuable content. This study surveys the previous literature to explain the lifespan of user created content and proposes a theoretical framework that considers three major stakeholders in the Web 2.0 business environments - content contributors, content consumers, and service platform providers. Based on the theoretical understanding, a model that explains the survivability of a user created content is developed and empirically tested using three months of log data collected by an Internet personal broadcasting service provider. The proposed theoretical framework provides researchers with insights into the interworking of the three major players in the novel business environments. The results of the empirical analysis suggest that content providers' commitments and positive rewards to intrinsic motivations, content consumers' acceptances and perceived popularity of available content, and the service platform provider's support for social network capabilities and popularity signaling mechanisms are important factors that Web 2.0 service providers must carefully manage in order to improve the longevity of value-adding user created content.",Business,BISOM,2013.0

In a randomized, crossover design with a 3-wk washout period, swimmers (n = 9) completed 10-d training with or without 16 fl oz of JUICE (230 mg flavonoids) ingested pre- and postworkout. Blood samples were taken presupplementation, post-10-d supplementation, and immediately postexercise, with data analyzed using a 2 × 3 repeated-measures ANOVA. Prestudy blood samples were also acquired from nonathletic controls (n = 7, age- and weight-matched) and revealed higher levels of oxidative stress in the swimmers, no differences in inflammation or immune function, and a distinct separation in global metabolic scores (R2Y [cum] = .971). Swim workouts consisted of high-intensity intervals (1:1, 1:2 swim-to-rest ratio) and induced little inflammation, oxidative stress, or immune changes. A distinct separation in global metabolic scores was found pre- to postexercise (R2Y [cum] = .976), with shifts detected in a small number of metabolites related to substrate utilization. No effect of 10-d JUICE was found on chronic resting levels or postexercise inflammation, oxidative stress, immune function, and shifts in metabolites. In conclusion, sprint and middle-distance swimmers had a slight chronic elevation in oxidative stress compared with nonathletic controls, experienced a low magnitude of postworkout perturbations in the biomarkers included in this study, and received no apparent benefit other than added nutrient intake from ingesting JUICE pre- and postworkout for 10 days.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2013.0

However, competence causal ambiguity, which helps create competitiveness, is also implicated in competitiveness decay. In this study we test a model of specialization-competitiveness-performance using primary and secondary data from 169 public respondents/firms, to examine the effects of negative internal barriers to replication and adaptation. These barriers develop due to resource lock-in arising from the same specialization processes that lead to the positive barriers to imitation that deter competitors. Results suggest that commitment to learning can mitigate resource lock-in problems with internal competence causal ambiguity, competence causal ambiguity among competitors appears more essential to competitiveness in more competitive markets, competitiveness positively relates to both shareholder value and new product performance, and an increased differential focus on marketing versus operations in the organization strengthens the positive bridge between organizational competitiveness and shareholder return.",Business,Marketing,2013.0

Some assign policymaking responsibility to institutions designed to be insulated from myopic partisan and electoral pressures and others do not. In this study, we claim that differences in political context and institutional design constrain the policy choices governments make. Testable propositions based on an analysis of varying electoral incentives and time horizons created by these different contexts are empirically tested using panel data on official general fund revenue forecasts in the American states, 1987 to 2008. The empirical evidence reveals that executive branch agencies and independent commissions produce more conservative forecasts than legislatures with one important exception. Executive branch revenue forecasts in states with gubernatorial term limits are indistinguishable from legislative branch forecasts. Further, we find that legislative branch forecasts are more conservative in the presence of divided partisan legislatures than unified party government. In turn, this implies that entrusting policymaking authority to either the executive branch or an independent commission may only be consequential when the political system itself fails to check legislative excesses or executive myopia.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Political Science and Public Administration,2013.0
2-s2.0-84875611875,Conference Paper,"The automated tracking of social insects, such as ants, could dramatically increase the fidelity and amount of analyzed data for studying complex group behaviors. Recently, data association based multiple object tracking methods have shown promise in improving handling of occlusions. However, the tracking of ants in a colony is still challenging as (1) their motion is often sporadic and irregular and (2) they are mostly present the entire duration of video. In this paper, we propose to improve the data association based tracking of multiple ants. First, we model the ant's motion using a set of irregular motion features including random walk model. Second, we use the convergence of particle filter based tracking to match tracklets with a long temporal gap. Testing results of two-fold cross validation on a 10,000 frame video shows that our proposed method was able to reduce the number of fragments by 61% and ID switches by 57%.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2013.0

Study participants (60% female and 40% male; n=998) varied widely in age (18-85 years) and BMI (16.7-52.7kg/m2) completed an extensive medical/health and lifestyle questionnaire, and data were used to establish pFIT and ExFreq tertiles. Biomarkers included serum C-reactive protein (CRP), total blood leukocytes, five plasma cytokines [interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP1), and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF)], F2-isoprostanes, ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP), and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC). A general linear model was used to examine relationships between pFIT and ExFreq with inflammation and oxidative stress while controlling for age, gender, BMI, and smoking. Benjamini-Hochberg method for false discovery rate correction was used for multiple testing corrections. Significant tests (P&lt;0.05) for trend were found for the effect of pFIT and ExFreq on CRP, white blood cell, IL-6, TNF-α, GCSF, and F2-isoprostanes, but not MCP1, IL-10, FRAP, and ORAC, after adjustment for confounders.

We propose that relationships are important mechanisms through which socialization tactics influence commitment and turnover. The key theoretical mechanisms connecting socialization tactics to turnover in our model are the extent to which newcomers perceive their relationship with the organization as supportive, caring, and entailing positive social exchanges and the extent to which newcomers become embedded within the organization. We collected longitudinal data from over 500 employees over the first year of employment. Consistent with our hypotheses, socialization tactics influence perceived organizational support (POS) and job embeddedness, and POS and embeddedness both relate to organizational commitment and voluntary turnover. Results support POS and embeddedness as relational mechanisms that bind employees to the organization as a result of socialization tactics.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Organizational Science,2013.0

Seven players with unilateral patellar tendinopathy (PT group) on the lead extremity (used for forward lunge) and nine players with no current or previous patellar tendinopathy (CT group) were included. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess distal patellar tendon dimensions. Patellar tendon mechanical properties were assessed using simultaneous tendon force and deformation measurements. Distal tendon cross-sectional area (CSA) normalized for body weight (mm2/kg2/3) was lower in the PT group compared with the CT group on both the non-lead extremity (6.1±0.3 vs 7.4±0.2, P&lt;0.05) and the lead extremity (6.5±0.6 vs 8.4±0.3, P&lt;0.05). Distal tendon stress was higher in the PT group compared with the CT group for both the non-lead extremity (31±1 vs 27±1MPa, P&lt;0.05) and the lead extremity (32±3 vs 21±3MPa, P&lt;0.01). Conclusively, the PT group had smaller distal patellar tendon CSA on both the injured (lead extremity) and the uninjured side (non-lead extremity) compared with the CT group. Subsequently, the smaller CSA yielded a greater distal patellar tendon stress in the PT group.

This structural diversity has made the identification and classification of pollen grains an important tool in many fields. Despite the myriad of applications, the classification of pollen grains is still a tedious and time-consuming process that must be performed by highly skilled specialists. In this paper, we propose an automatic classification method to discriminate pollen grains coming from a variety of taxonomic types. First, we develop a new feature that captures the spikes of pollen to improve the classification accuracy. Second, we take advantage of the classification rules extracted from the existing pollen types and apply them to the new types. Third, we introduce a new selection criterion to obtain the most valuable training samples from the unlabeled data and therefore reduce the number of needed training samples. Our experiment demonstrates that the proposed method reduces the training effort of a human expert up to 80% compared to other classification methods while achieving 92% accuracy in pollen classification.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2013.0

The purpose of this study was to assess whether the cumulative effects of multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across genes of choline/ 1-carbon metabolism and functionally related pathways increase susceptibility to developing hepatic steatosis. In biopsy-characterized cases of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and controls, we assessed 260 SNPs across 21 genes in choline/1-carbon metabolism. When SNPs were examined individually, using logistic regression, we only identified a single SNP (PNPLA3 rs738409) that was significantly associated with severity of hepatic steatosis after adjusting for confounders and multiple comparisons (P=0.02). However, when groupings of SNPs in similar metabolic pathways were defined using unsupervised hierarchical clustering, we identified groups of subjects with shared SNP signatures that were significantly correlated with steatosis burden (P=0.0002). The lowest and highest steatosis clusters could also be differentiated by ethnicity. However, unique SNP patterns defined steatosis burden irrespective of ethnicity. Our results suggest that analysis of SNP patterns in genes of choline/1-carbon metabolism may be useful for prediction of severity of steatosis in specific subsets of people, and the metabolic inefficiencies caused by these SNPs should be examined further.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2013.0

This study examined the relationships between spiritual/religious, demographic and clinical variables and quality of life among Iranian Muslims undergoing haemodialysis. Methods Using a cross-sectional design, 362 haemodialysis patients were surveyed from three general hospitals located in Tehran, Iran. Spiritual coping strategies, Duke University Religion Index, EQ-5D 3L and a demographic questionnaire were administered. Hierarchical regression was used to identify predictors of quality of life and health status. Results The distribution of reported problems across dimensions of quality of life was: mobility (59.4%), usual activities (30.4%), self-care (21.3%), pain/discomfort (47.8%) and anxiety/depression (29.3%). Univariate analysis showed that factors such as age, sex, marital status, location, number of children, body mass index, serum albumin, having diabetes mellitus or other comorbidity, as well as spiritual/religious factors that were related to quality of life, health status or both. Regression models revealed that demographics, clinical variables and especially spiritual/religious factors explained about 40% of variance of quality of life and nearly 25% of the variance in health status. Conclusion Spiritual resources may contribute to better quality of life and health status among haemodialysis patients.

Measures of dynamic stability have been used extensively to classify ankle instability status and assist clinicians with ankle injury interventions. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine if current methods of quantifying dynamic stability are accurate in differentiating among healthy, coper, and unstable ankles. Methods One hundred ninety four Division-I collegiate athletes (football, volleyball, field hockey, men's/women's soccer, men's/women's lacrosse, men's/women's basketball) volunteered for this study. Participants were categorized into healthy, coper, and stable groups by a self-reported questionnaire and previous history of ankle injuries. Dynamic postural stability was assessed using the Multi-Directional Dynamic Stability Protocol by jumping and landing single-legged onto a force platform from four different directions. Receiver operator curves were used to analyze the accuracy of current techniques of calculating dynamic stability among groups. Findings None of the existing methods were found to be accurate in differentiating ankle instability status in any of the jump landings. Interpretation Researchers have commonly used these existing methods to quantify dynamic postural stability. None of the current calculation techniques worked with our jump landing protocol. Researchers need to pay attention to the protocol and calculation technique pairings in that using inaccurate measures of dynamic postural stability makes any findings of that research ineffective. Therefore, this challenges researchers to develop a more accurate calculation to quantify dynamic postural stability, or develop a jump landing protocol that exposes sensorimotor deficits in the more able-bodied population.",CHHS,Kinesiology,2013.0

Alternatively, contemporary perspectives on self-compassion suggest that individual differences in this adaptive approach to self-regulation may serve to counteract these cognitive-affective triggers presumably resulting in reductions in binge eating severity. Accordingly, the present cross-sectional analysis examined an indirect effect model of positive dimensions of self-compassion on binge eating severity through both emotional tolerance and unconditional self-acceptance pathways. Two hundred fifteen undergraduate students (78% female) completed self-report measures of the variables of interest; BMI was calculated from self-reported heights and weights. Pearson's correlations revealed a positive linear association between self-compassion and unconditional self-acceptance; negative links were observed between self-compassion and emotional intolerance along with the severity of binge eating symptoms. A subsequent multiple mediator analysis utilizing both normal test theory and robust non-parametric bootstrap resampling procedures confirmed the presence of a significant total indirect effect of self-compassion on binge eating severity (-. .15, p. <. 0.001) through the combined mediators along with yielding specific indirect effects for both emotional tolerance (-. .05, p. <. 0.05) and unconditional self-acceptance (-. .11, p. <. 0.01) which were preserved in a model adjusted for BMI.

Object-driven action rules are action rules that are extracted from information systems with temporal and object-based nature. By object-based nature, we refer to systems that contain multiple observations for each object. A typical example of an object-based system would be a system of patients recording multiple visits; each patient is considered a distinct object. In this paper, we will further investigate the concept of object-driven action rules by proposing a new pair-based way of examining object-driven systems, which we believe is more intuitive for temporal and object-driven systems.

The purpose of this investigation was to examine whether increased blood levels of β-endorphin modify breathlessness by a putative effect of binding to peripheral opioid receptors in the respiratory tract. Methods: Twenty patients with COPD (10 women and 10 men; age, 70 ± 8 years) inspired through resistances during practice sessions to identify an individualized target load that caused ratings of intensity and unpleasantness of breathlessness ≥ 50 mm on a 100-mm visual analog scale. At two interventions, blood levels of β-endorphin and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) were measured, ketoconazole (600 mg) or placebo was administered orally, and patients rated the two dimensions of breathlessness each minute during resistive load breathing (RLB). Results: By inhibiting cortisol synthesis, ketoconazole led to significant increases in β-endorphin (mean change, 20% ± 4%) and ACTH (mean change, 21% ± 4%) compared with placebo. The intensity and unpleasantness ratings of breathlessness and the endurance time during RLB were similar in the two interventions. Conclusions: The previously demonstrated modulatory effect of endogenous opioids on breathlessness appears to be mediated by binding to receptors within the CNS rather than to peripheral opioid receptors in the respiratory tract. An alternative explanation is that the magnitude of the β-endorphin response is inadequate to affect peripheral opioid receptors.

2-s2.0-84875997194,Article,"Well-known 'routing hole' problem of geographic routing is hardly avoided in wireless sensor networks because of various actual geographical environments. Existing geographic routing protocols use perimeter routing strategies to find a detour path around the boundary of holes when they encounter the local minimum during greedy forwarding. However, this solution may lead to uneven energy consumption around the holes since it consumes more energy of the boundary sensors. It becomes more serious when holes appear in most of routing paths in a large-scale sensor network. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed strategy to balance the traffic load on the boundary of holes by virtually changing the sizes of these holes. The proposed mechanism dynamically controls holes to expand and shrink circularly without changing the underlying forwarding strategy. Therefore, it can be applied to most of the existing geographic routing protocols which detour around holes. Simulation results show that our strategy can effectively balance the load around holes, thus prolonging the network life of sensor networks when an existing geographic routing protocol is used as the underlying routing protocol.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2013.0

Most estimates have implicitly assumed that extraction of wind energy does not alter large-scale winds enough to significantly limit wind power production. Estimates that ignore the effect of wind turbine drag on local winds have assumed that wind power production of 2-4 W m-2 can be sustained over large areas. New results from a mesoscale model suggest that wind power production is limited to about 1 W m-2 at wind farm scales larger than about 100 km2. We find that the mesoscale model results are quantitatively consistent with results from global models that simulated the climate response to much larger wind power capacities. Wind resource estimates that ignore the effect of wind turbines in slowing large-scale winds may therefore substantially overestimate the wind power resource.,Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2013.0

Preliminary results highlight the need for college health officials at both predominantly White as well as minority-serving institutions to adequately address the significant concern over first-year weight gain in conjunction with the desire to lose weight expressed by an appreciable number of incoming college females. Findings also advocate the utility of evaluating social norm theory and the third-person perceptual bias in the context of first-year weight gain to potentially enhance the design and effectiveness of healthy weight management initiatives among ethnically-diverse young women entering college.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Psychology,2013.0

Although experimental research articles have assumed increasing prominence within the journal since the late 1980s, the vast majority of published studies could be characterized as primarily descriptive in focus. While almost one quarter of research articles involved some type of intervention evaluation, only 25 studies reported using research designs that could allow causal claims to be made. The data collection approaches used in these studies were quite diverse, with self-report surveys and questionnaires representing the dominant approach.

2-s2.0-84876458680,Article,"Ultra-scale data analysis has created many new challenges for visualization. For example, in climate research with two-dimensional time-varying data, scientists find it crucial to study the hidden temporal relationships from a set of large scale images, whose resolutions are much higher than that of general computer monitors. When scientists can only visualize a small portion (< 1/1000) of a time step at one time, it is extremely challenging to analyze the temporal features from multiple time steps. As this problem cannot be simply solved with interaction or display technologies, this paper presents a milli-scaling approach by designing downscaling algorithms with significant ratios. Our approach can produce readable-sized images of multiple ultra-scale visualizations, while preserving important data features and temporal relationships. Using the climate visualization as the testing application, we demonstrate that our approach provides a new tool for users to effectively make sense of multiple, large-format visualizations.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2012.0

2-s2.0-84876488088,Article,"Intensive agricultural land use in the 18th to early 20th centuries on the southeastern Piedmont resulted in substantial soil erosion and gully development. Today, many historically farmed areas have been abandoned and afforested, and such landscapes are an opportunity to study channel network recovery from disturbance by gullying. Channel initiation mapping, watershed area-slope relationships, and field monitoring of flow generation processes are used to identify channel network extent and place it in hydrologic, historical and landscape evolution context. In six study areas in the North Carolina Piedmont, 100 channel heads were mapped in fully-forested watersheds, revealing a channel initiation relationship of 380=AS1.27, where A is contributing area (m2) and S is local slope (m/m). Flow in these channels is generated by subsurface and overland flow. The measured relative slope exponent is lower than expected based on literature values of ~2 for forested watersheds with subsurface and overland flow, suggesting that the channel network extent may reflect a former hydrological regime. However, geomorphic evidence of recovery in channel heads within fully forested watersheds is greater than those with present day pasture. Present day channel heads lie within hollows or downslope of unchanneled valleys, which may be remnants of historical gullies, and area-slope relationships provide evidence of colluvial aggradation within the valleys. Channel network extent appears to be sensitive to land use change, with recovery beginning within decades of afforestation. Channel initiation mapping and area-slope relationships are shown to be useful tools for interpreting geomorphic effects of land use change.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2013.0

Simulation land-surface parameterizations included present day and plausible 2050 land-covers, as well as two extreme deforestation simulations. In the simulations, the original land cover map of RegCM3, based on AVHRR 1992-93 observations, was replaced with one obtained from MODIS 2001 observations; and the model was set to work at two different spatial resolutions using the sub-grid feature of the land surface model: 27. 79 km for the atmosphere and 9. 26 km for the land surface. During validation, modeled precipitation closely matched observed precipitation over southern China, but underestimated precipitation in the Indochina Peninsula. The plausible 2050 LCLU simulation predicted little change in regional climate. However, an extreme irrigated crop parameterization caused precipitation to increase slightly in the Indochina Peninsula, decrease substantially in southeastern China, and increase significantly in the South China Sea. The extreme short-grass parameterization caused substantial precipitation decreases in MMSEA, but few changes elsewhere.

Unfortunately, expert level opening knowledge is only sparsely available for 9×9 Go. We set to build expert level opening books for 9×9 Go. Approach: We present two completely different approaches to build opening books for 9×9 Go without relying on human Go expertise. The first approach is based on game outcome statistics on opening sequences from 300,000 actual 9×9 Go games played by computer programs. The second approach uses off-line stage-wise Monte-Caro tree search. Results: After ""solution tree"" style trimming, the opening books are compact and can be used effectively. Testing results show that GoIntellect using the opening books is 4% stronger than GoIntellect without the opening books in terms of winning rates against Gnugo and other programs. In addition, using an opening book makes the program 10% faster. Conclusion: Classical knowledge and search approach does not work well in the game of Go.

2-s2.0-84876883797,Article,"The urban transformation of the planet has spurred interest across a wide variety of disciplines in the fundamental changes to human society and the environment that result from urbanization. Landscape ecology is no exception. Since the late 1980s, the number of papers devoted to the study of the ecology of urban landscapes has risen dramatically. This trend prompted the question I address in this paper: what are the distinguishing features of the study of the ecology of urban landscapes? To answer this question, I reviewed 894 papers, published between 1987 and 2011, describing the ecology of urban terrestrial landscapes. Landscape ecologists who study urban landscapes use the gradient paradigm and the urban ecosystem framework to shape their research questions. They study subjects such as land use/land cover change, the ecological effects of land use type and pattern, and human-made habitats that receive less attention from landscape ecologists studying non-urban areas. They also study a very wide variety of disturbances that occur in urban landscapes. And, increasingly, they are making use of citizen-generated data to answer their questions. Knowledge of the ecology of urban landscapes is largely based on comparisons of land use types, investigations along the urban gradient, and research centered on remnant habitat fragments in an urban matrix. Future directions for the study of the ecology of urban landscapes include testing whether understanding derived in less modified landscapes can be applied to intensively modified urban landscapes, investigating the interactions between agents of global change, such as climate change, and urbanization, investigating the effects of matrix quality on the biodiversity of habitat fragments, expanding our understanding of the ecological effects of land use pattern, and assessing the trade-offs between human needs and the needs of other species by means of transdisciplinary collaborations.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2013.0

Design/Methodology/Approach: We explored value diversity within a comprehensive framework such that all components of basic human values were examined. A sample of 306 participants randomly assigned to 60 teams, performed a complex hands-on task, demanding high interdependence among team members, and completed different measures of values and team processes. Findings: Results indicated that value diversity among team members had no significant impact on task performance. However, diversity with respect to several value dimensions had a significant unique effect on team process criteria. Results were consistent with respect to the nature of the impact of value diversity on team process outcomes. Specifically, the impact of team value diversity was such that less diversity was positively related to process outcomes (i. e., more similarity resulted in more team cohesion and efficacy and less conflict). Implications: The results indicated that disparity among teammates in many of these values may have important implications on subsequent team-level phenomena. We suggest team leaders and facilitators of teambuilding efforts could consider adding to their agendas a session with team members to analyze and discuss the combined value profiles of their team.

Forty-two focus groups represented African Americans, American Indians, Chinese Americans, Latinos, Vietnamese Americans, and Whites other than Latinos (Whites) (N=396, ages 50+), in nine locations in the United States of America. Axial coding connected categories and identified themes. The constant comparison method compared themes across ethnic groups. African Americans, American Indians and Whites emphasised memory loss. African Americans, American Indians, Latinos and Whites stressed withdrawal, isolation and repetitive speech. African Americans, American Indians, Vietnamese Americans and Whites emphasised 'slow thinking'. Only Whites described mood swings and personality changes. Many participants attributed dementia to stress. Terms describing others with dementia included 'Alzheimer's', 'dementia', 'senile' and 'crazy'. Euphemisms were common ('senior moment', 'old timer's disease'). Responses focused on memory, with limited mention of other cognitive functions. Differences among ethnic groups in descriptions of cognitive health and cognitive impairment underscore the need to tailor public health messages about cognitive health to ways that people construe its loss, and to their interest in maintaining it, so that messages and terms used are familiar, understandable and relevant to the groups for which they are designed.

Many genes involved in the key processes of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation have been well studied in model diploid organisms. However, gene and genome duplication may alter the function of the genes involved in these processes. To address this question, we assayed the stress-induced transcription patterns of duplicated gene pairs involved in RNAi and DNA methylation processes in the paleopolyploid soybean. Real-time quantitative PCR and Sequenom MassARRAY expression assays were used to profile the relative expression ratios of eight gene pairs across eight different biotic and abiotic stress conditions. The transcriptional responses to stress for genes involved in DNA methylation, RNAi processing, and miRNA processing were compared. The strongest evidence for pairwise co-expression in response to stresses was exhibited by non-paralogous Dicer-like (DCL) genes GmDCL2a-GmDCL3a and GmDCL1b-GmDCL2b, most profoundly in root tissues. Among homoeologous or paralogous DCL genes, the Dicer-like 2 (DCL2) gene pair exhibited the strongest response to stress and most conserved co-expression pattern. This was surprising because the DCL2 duplication event is more ancient than the other DCL duplications.

We sought to define a robust set of genes regulated by cytokinin as well as to query the response of genes not represented on microarrays. To this end, we performed a meta-analysis of microarray data from a variety of cytokinin-treated samples and used RNA-seq to examine cytokinin- regulated gene expression in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Microarray meta-analysis using 13 microarray experiments combined with empirically defined filtering criteria identified a set of 226 genes differentially regulated by cytokinin, a subset of which has previously been validated by other methods. RNA-seq validated about 73% of the up-regulated genes identified by this meta-analysis. In silico promoter analysis indicated an overrepresentation of type-B Arabidopsis response regulator binding elements, consistent with the role of type-B Arabidopsis response regulators as primary mediators of cytokinin-responsive gene expression. RNA-seq analysis identified 73 cytokinin-regulated genes that were not represented on the ATH1 microarray. Representative genes were verified using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and NanoString analysis. Analysis of the genes identified reveals a substantial effect of cytokinin on genes encoding proteins involved in secondary metabolism, particularly those acting in flavonoid and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, as well as in the regulation of redox state of the cell, particularly a set of glutaredoxin genes. Novel splicing events were found in members of some gene families that are known to play a role in cytokinin signaling or metabolism.

2-s2.0-84877268399,"General Publications (Press, Editorials, Letters)","The cardiovascular system is susceptible to a group of diseases that are responsible for a larger proportion of morbidity and mortality than any other disease. Many cardiovascular diseases are associated with a failure of defenses against oxidative stress-induced cellular damage and/or death, leading to organ dysfunction. The pleiotropic transcription factor, nuclear factor-erythroid (NF-E) 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), regulates the expression of antioxidant enzymes and proteins through the antioxidant response element. Nrf2 is an important component in antioxidant defenses in cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, and heart failure. Nrf2 is also involved in protection against oxidant stress during the processes of ischemia-reperfusion injury and aging. However, evidence suggests that Nrf2 activity does not always lead to a positive outcome and may accelerate the pathogenesis of some cardiovascular diseases (e.g., atherosclerosis). The precise conditions under which Nrf2 acts to attenuate or stimulate cardiovascular disease processes are unclear. Further studies on the cellular environments related to cardiovascular diseases that influence Nrf2 pathways are required before Nrf2 can be considered a therapeutic target for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.",CHHS,Kinesiology,2013.0

In this work, we demonstrate a computer vision algorithm based on optical flow to compute egomotion from live colonoscopy video, which is then used to navigate and visualize the corresponding patient anatomy from X-ray CT data. The key feature of the algorithm lies in the effective combination of sparse and dense optical flow fields to compute the focus of expansion (FOE); FOE permits independent computation of camera translational and rotational parameters, directly contributing to the algorithm's accuracy and robustness. We performed extensive evaluation via a colon phantom and clinical colonoscopy data. We constructed two colon like phantoms, a straight phantom and a curved phantom to measure actual colonoscopy motion; tracking accuracy was quantitatively evaluated by comparing estimated motion parameters (velocity and displacement) to ground truth. Thirty straight and curved phantom sequences were collected at 10, 15 and 20. mm/s (5 trials at each speed), to simulate typical velocities during colonoscopy procedures. The average error in velocity estimation was within 3. mm/s in both straight and curved phantoms. Displacement error was under 7. mm over a total distance of 287-288. mm in the straight and curved phantoms. Algorithm robustness was successfully demonstrated on 27 optical colonoscopy image sequences from 20 different patients, and spanning 5 different colon segments.

We model such network as a weighted space-time graph with both spacial and temporal information. Links inside the space-time graph are unreliable due to either the dynamic nature of wireless communications or the rough prediction of underlying human/device mobility. The aim of our topology design problem is to build a sparse space-time structure such that (1) for any pair of devices, there is a space-time path connecting them with the reliability larger than a required threshold; (2) the total cost of the structure is minimized.

In addition to stable personality traits, research in psychology has found that temporary changes in affect (emotion) can also significantly impact performance during cognitive tasks. In this paper, we show that affective priming also influences user performance on visual judgment tasks through an experiment that combines affective priming with longstanding graphical perception experiments. Our results suggest that affective priming can influence accuracy in common graphical perception tasks. We discuss possible explanations for these findings, and describe how these findings can be applied to design visualizations that are less (or more) susceptible to error in common visualization contexts.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2013.0

The purpose of the present study was to determine if quercetin, vitamin C and niacin supplements (Q-500 = 500 mg/d of quercetin, 125 mg/d of vitamin C and 5 mg/d of niacin; Q-1000 = 1000 mg/d of quercetin, 250 mg/d of vitamin C and 10 mg/d of niacin) would alter small-molecule metabolite profiles and serum quercetin conjugate levels in adults. Healthy adults (fifty-eight women and forty-two men; aged 40-83 years) were assigned using a randomised double-blinded placebo-controlled trial to one of three supplement groups (Q-1000, Q-500 or placebo). Overnight fasted blood samples were collected at 0, 1 and 3 months. Quercetin conjugate concentrations were measured using ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC)-MS/MS, and metabolite profiles were measured using two MS platforms (UPLC-quadrupole time-of-flight MS (TOFMS) and GC-TOFMS). Statistical procedures included partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and linear mixed model analysis with repeated measures. After accounting for age, sex and BMI, quercetin supplementation was associated with significant shifts in 163 metabolites/quercetin conjugates (false discovery rate, P&lt; 0·05). The top five metabolite shifts were an increase in serum guaiacol, 2-oxo-4-methylthiobutanoic acid, allocystathionine and two bile acids. Inflammatory and oxidative stress metabolites were not affected. PLS-DA revealed a clear separation only between the 1000 mg/d and placebo groups (Q 2 Y= 0·763). The quercetin conjugate, isorhamnetin-3- glucuronide, had the highest concentration at 3 months followed by quercetin-3-glucuronide, quercetin-3-sulphate and quercetin diglucuronide. In human subjects, long-term quercetin supplementation exerts disparate and wide-ranging metabolic effects and changes in quercetin conjugate concentrations.

2-s2.0-84878150238,Article,"Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is one of the most widely cultivated legumes grown for its dietary fiber and protein. Bean rust caused by the fungal pathogen Uromyces appendiculatus is a major constraint for bean production. Ur-3, one of several race specific loci in the bean genome contributing to rust resistance, provides resistance to 44 of the 89 rust races curated in the United States. Thus, development of markers linked to this locus is very important. The bean cultivar ""Sierra"" exhibits hypersensitive resistance response to race 53. The susceptible mutants ur3-δ2 and ur3-δ3 were derived by fast neutron bombardment of Sierra, and have deletions in the Ur-3 region of the genome. This research is aimed at finding molecular markers associated with the deleted region in the mutants as a tool to better understand Ur-3-mediated rust resistance. Until now, only two RAPD-derived sequence characterized amplification region markers SK14 and SAE 19 are available for the Ur-3 locus. We discovered that these markers are present (as PCR amplicons) in Sierra but are absent in the ur3-δ2 and ur3-δ3 mutants. We attempted to develop new molecular markers for characterization and tracking of this genomic region. Hybridization of a SK14-derived overgo probe showed erratic results by identifying BACs in and outside of the Ur-3 region. Therefore, we developed a new SCAR marker named DESU-G1 utilizing the amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) methodology for this deleted region in the ur-3 rust susceptible mutants.

Quarterly pension costs are one of the largest single expense items for firms with pension plans (around 15% of income before extraordinary items in our sample). Under ASC 270, net pension costs should be recognized as incurred, or as the benefit provided by the expense is realized. We find that over the period of 2004-2010, there is significant variation in the amount of quarterly pension cost firms report. In addition, we find that income-increasing changes in pension costs are significantly associated with meeting or beating analysts' forecasts in a given quarter. We also show that income-decreasing changes to net periodic pension costs that would cause a firm to miss its earnings forecast are extremely rare. Finally, we find evidence that income-increasing and income-decreasing changes in quarterly pension costs are ""settled up"" in the fourth quarter (e.g., they are reversed).",Business,Accounting,2013.0

An improved protocol was developed for the accurate, efficient, and rapid comparative screening for large blueberry sample sets. Triplicates of six commercial cultivars and four breeding selections were analyzed using the new method. The compound recoveries ranged from 94.2 to 97.5 ± 5.3% when samples were spiked with commercial standards prior to extraction. Eighteen anthocyanins and 4 phenolic acids were quantified in frozen and freeze-dried fruits. Large variations for individual and total anthocyanins, ranging from 201.4 to 402.8 mg/100 g, were assayed in frozen fruits. The total phenolic acid content ranged from 23.6 to 61.7 mg/100 g in frozen fruits. Across all genotypes, freeze-drying resulted in minor reductions in anthocyanin concentration (3.9%) compared to anthocyanins in frozen fruits. However, phenolic acids increased by an average of 1.9-fold (±0.3) in the freeze-dried fruit. Different genotypes frequently had comparable overall levels of total anthocyanins and phenolic acids, but differed dramatically in individual profiles of compounds.

Development of novel approaches for detection and/or targeting of MUC1 are critically needed and should be able to detect MUC1 on PC cells (including cancer stem cells) and in serum. Methods The sensitivity and specificity of the anti-MUC1 antibody, TAB 004, was determined. CSCs were assessed for MUC1 expression using TAB 004-FITC on in vitro PC cell lines, and on lineage- cells from in vivo tumors and human samples. Serum was assessed for shed MUC1 via the TAB 004 EIA. Results In vitro and in vivo, TAB 004 detected MUC1 on &gt;95% of CSCs. Approximately, 80% of CSCs in patients displayed MUC1 expression as detected by TAB 004. Shed MUC1 was detected serum in mice with HPAF-II (MUC1high) but not BxPC3 tumors (MUC1low). The TAB 004 EIA was able to accurately detect stage progression in PC patients.

Where the player sees a rich visual representation of 3D objects, internally these are just very sparsely described collections of points in space. Tools for advanced world creation, character modeling, animation, and advancements in computer graphics have brought us into the age of near photo-realistic interaction; however, these interactions are still very limited in comparison to the real world, and the information is presented overwhelmingly for the player, packaged for the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) with little reflection or structure suitable for use by AI systems. This problem of a lack of rich information suitable for consumption by the game AI often limits the true potential for deeper levels of interaction that are becoming more in-demand by game players. This chapter presents a number of tools and techniques, which are being used to improve the embedded information contained in immersive game worlds. Symbolic annotation of the environmental elements, advanced spatial decomposition, calculating the information value of the surfaces in an interactive environment, and visual analysis form the core tools and information generators of our Common Games Understanding and Learning (CGUL) Toolkit. Using these tools to incorporate information into the game design and development process can help create information-rich interactive worlds. AI developers can work with these environmental information elements to improve non-player character (NPC) interactions both with the player and the environment, enhancing interaction, and leading to new possibilities such as meaningful in-game learning and character portability.

An ABM of individual-level spatial interaction that simulates information exchange, spatial diffusion of opinion development, and consensus building among decision makers is proposed to demonstrate the advantages of the parallel approach against its sequential counterpart. This study focuses on two key spatial properties of the interaction system of interest, the extent and range of interaction, and examines their influence on the computing performance of the proposed parallel model and the performance scalability of the model as more computing resources are added. Significant influence from these two properties is found and can be attributed to three possible sources of effects, namely the model level, the parallelization level, and the platform level.

In this work, we present a comparative analysis of our optical flow based technique for colonoscopy tracking, in relation to current state of the art methods, in terms of tracking accuracy, system stability, and computational efficiency. Our optical-flow based colonoscopy tracking algorithm starts with computing multi-scale dense and sparse optical flow fields to measure image displacements. Camera motion parameters are then determined from optical flow fields by employing a Focus of Expansion (FOE) constrained egomotion estimation scheme. We analyze the design choices involved in the three major components of our algorithm: dense optical flow, sparse optical flow, and egomotion estimation. Brox's optical flow method,1 due to its high accuracy, was used to compare and evaluate our multi-scale dense optical flow scheme. SIFT6 and Harris-affine features7 were used to assess the accuracy of the multi-scale sparse optical flow, because of their wide use in tracking applications; the FOE-constrained egomotion estimation was compared with collinear,2 image deformation10 and image derivative 4 based egomotion estimation methods, to understand the stability of our tracking system. Two virtual colonoscopy (VC) image sequences were used in the study, since the exact camera parameters(for each frame) were known; dense optical flow results indicated that Brox's method was superior to multi-scale dense optical flow in estimating camera rotational velocities, but the final tracking errors were comparable, viz., 6mm vs. 8mm after the VC camera traveled 110mm. Our approach was computationally more efficient, averaging 7.2 sec. vs. 38 sec. per frame. SIFT and Harris affine features resulted in tracking errors of up to 70mm, while our sparse optical flow error was 6mm. The comparison among egomotion estimation algorithms showed that our FOE-constrained egomotion estimation method achieved the optimal balance between tracking accuracy and robustness. The comparative study demonstrated that our optical-flow based colonoscopy tracking algorithm maintains good accuracy and stability for routine use in clinical practice.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2013.0

These scores are subsequently compared to a fixed detection threshold and classified as either benign or malicious. We argue that a real-time ADS' input changes considerably over time and a fixed threshold value cannot guarantee good anomaly detection accuracy for such a time-varying input. In this article, we propose a simple and generic technique to adaptively tune the detection threshold of any ADS that works on threshold method. To this end, we first perform statistical and information-theoretic analysis of network- and host-based ADSs' anomaly scores to reveal a consistent time correlation structure during benign activity periods. We model the observed correlation structure using Markov chains, which are in turn used in a stochastic target tracking framework to adapt an ADS' detection threshold in accordance with real-time measurements. We also use statistical techniques to make the proposed algorithm resilient to sporadic changes and evasion attacks. In order to evaluate the proposed approach, we incorporate the proposed adaptive thresholding module into multiple ADSs and evaluate those ADSs over comprehensive and independently collected network and host attack datasets. We show that, while reducing the need of human threshold configuration, the proposed technique provides considerable and consistent accuracy improvements for all evaluated ADSs.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2013.0

2-s2.0-84878620527,Article,"Lateral ankle sprains are a common consequence of physical activity. If not managed appropriately, a cascade of negative alterations to both the joint structure and a person's movement patterns continue to stress the injured ligaments. These alterations result in an individual entering a continuum of disability as evidenced by the ~30 % of ankle sprains that develop into chronic ankle instability (CAI) and up to 78 % of CAI cases that develop into post-traumatic ankle osteoarthritis (OA). Despite this knowledge, no significant improvements in treatment efficacy have been made using traditional treatment paradigms. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to (1) provide an overview of the consequences associated with acute lateral ankle sprains, CAI and post-traumatic ankle OA; (2) introduce the patient-, clinician-, laboratory (PCL)-oriented) model that addresses the lateral ankle sprains and their consequences from a constraints perspective; and (3) introduce the dynamic systems theory as the framework to illustrate how multiple post-injury adaptations create a singular pathology that predisposes individuals with lateral ankle sprains to fall into a continuum of disability. The consequences associated with lateral ankle sprains, CAI and ankle OA are similar and encompass alterations to the structure of the ankle joint (e.g. ligament laxity, positional faults, etc.) and the sensorimotor function responsible for proper ankle joint function (e.g. postural control, gait, etc.). Further, the impairments have been quantified across a range of patient-oriented (e.g. self-report questionnaires), clinician-oriented (e.g. bedside measures of range of motion and postural control), and laboratory-oriented (e.g. arthrometry, gait analysis) outcome measures. The interaction of PCL-oriented outcomes is critically important for understanding the phenomenon of CAI across the continuum of disability. Through the integration of all three sources of evidence, we can clearly see that an ankle sprain is more than just a peripheral musculoskeletal pathology with only local consequences. The dynamic systems theory illustrates that the organization of human movement/function is shaped by the interaction of (1) organismic constraints (health of the person); (2) task constraints; and (3) environmental constraints. However, ankle sprains increase the organismic constraints (i.e. changes in joint structure and sensorimotor function) that significantly hinder an individual's function and may be the underlying cause for the continuum of disability associated with CAI. To treat and/or prevent an individual from entering the continuum of disability, greater protection of the ankle ligaments is needed immediately after injury. Subsequent rehabilitation should then focus on goal-oriented rehabilitation (i.e. quality of the movement pattern) rather that task-oriented rehabilitation (i.e. do these exercises). When evaluating patients with ankle inversion trauma and/or instability, it is imperative to remember that an ankle sprain is not simply a local joint injury; it can result in a constrained sensorimotor system that leads to a continuum of disability and life-long consequences such as high injury recurrence and decreased quality of life if not managed properly.",CHHS,Kinesiology,2013.0

Here we examine the relationship between city size and CO2 emissions for U.S. metropolitan areas using a production accounting allocation of emissions.

Little is known about the physiological mechanisms linking loneliness to the symptom cluster; immune dysregulation is a promising candidate. Latent herpesvirus reactivation, which is reflected by elevated herpesvirus antibody titers, provides a window into immune dysregulation. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) are two common herpesviruses. Methods: Participants were 200 breast cancer survivors who were 2 months to 3 years post-treatment at the time of the study. They completed questionnaires and provided a blood sample that was assayed for CMV and EBV antibody titers. Results: Lonelier participants experienced more pain, depression, and fatigue than those who felt more socially connected. Lonelier participants also had higher CMV antibody titers which, in turn, were associated with higher levels of the pain, depression, and fatigue symptom cluster. Contrary to expectations, EBV antibody titers were not associated with either loneliness or the symptom cluster. Conclusions: The pain, depression, and fatigue symptom cluster is a notable clinical problem, especially among cancer survivors. Accordingly, understanding the risk factors for these symptoms is important. The current study suggests that loneliness enhances risk for immune dysregulation and the pain, depression, and fatigue symptom cluster.

2-s2.0-84878924916,Conference Paper,"Well known 'hole' problem is hardly avoided in wireless sensor networks because of various actual geographical environments. Existing geographic routing protocols (such as GFG [1] and GPSR [2]) use perimeter routing strategies to find a detour path around the boundary of holes when they encounter the 'local minimum' during greedy forwarding. However, this solution may lead to uneven energy consumption around the holes since it consumes more energy of the boundary sensors. It becomes more serious when holes appear in most of routing paths in a large scale sensor network. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed strategy to balance the traffic load on the boundary of holes by virtually changing the sizes of these holes. The proposed mechanism dynamically controls holes to expand and shrink circularly without changing the underlying forwarding strategy. Therefore, it can be applied to most of the existing geographic routing protocols which detour around holes. Simulation results show that our new strategy can effectively balance the load around holes thus prolong the network life of sensor networks when using with GPSR.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2012.0
2-s2.0-84878954824,Article,"Some manufacturers sponsor ""free"" retailer gift cards to be given to consumers who purchase their products. These gift cards are paid for by the manufacturer and are redeemable on all products at the retailer. We develop a model of such a supply chain. We analyze cases in which the gift cards' redemption rate is constant or increasing in gift card value. The results indicate that in addition to the redemption rate and consumers' valuation for gift card dollars, the profitability of manufacturer-sponsored gift cards depends on the average gross margin of the retailer and the type of purchases consumers make with gift cards. Furthermore, we show that under certain conditions, free gift cards will increase the expected profits of the retailer and manufacturer as well as decrease the retail price of the product. These conditions include a retailer with large average gross margin and consumers using gift cards to purchase products they would not buy with cash otherwise. Furthermore, all consumers, including those who do not redeem the gift card, are more likely to benefit from a reduced retail price when their probability of redeeming the gift card after purchase is equal to their estimated redemption probability at purchase time. We show the conditions under which gift cards are more profitable than cash mail-in rebates. We develop an incentive scheme to improve the performance of supply chains with gift cards.",Business,BISOM,2013.0

Government initiatives are important particularly for reducing disparities that affect disadvantaged populations. Head Start, Healthy Start, WIC and Medicaid are four federal programs that target disparities in maternal and child health outcomes. This paper reviews recent evaluations of these programs to identify outcomes assessed and opportunities for further evaluation of these programs. We conducted a review of recent evaluation studies assessing the impact of four maternal and child health programs on a health or healthcare outcome. Sources for published literature included the PubMed, Academic Search Complete, CINAHL and PsycInfo databases. Titles and abstracts of studies were examined to determine if they met inclusion criteria. Included studies were categorized by type of outcome examined. Twenty peer-reviewed studies published between January 2006 and June 2011 met inclusion criteria. The majority of studies examined infant outcomes (11), followed by breastfeeding/nutrition (4), maternal health (3), and unintended pregnancy (2). Measures used were consistent across studies; however, findings on the impact of programs were mixed reflecting differences in selection of comparison group, data source and statistical methods. The impact of maternal and child health programs may vary by setting and population served, but inconclusive findings remain. Health service researchers can build upon current evaluations to increase our understanding of what works, help target resources, and improve evaluation of programs in the future.",CHHS,Public Health,2013.0
2-s2.0-84879106450,Article,"Six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) haptic rendering for fine manipulation in narrow space is a challenging topic because of frequent constraint changes caused by small tool movement and the requirement to preserve the feel of fine-features of objects. In this paper, we introduce a configuration-based constrained optimization method for solving this rendering problem. We represent an object using a hierarchy of spheres, i.e., a sphere tree, which allows faster detection of multiple contacts/collisions among objects than polygonal mesh and facilitates contact constraint formulation. Given a moving graphic tool as the avatar of the haptic tool in the virtual environment, we compute its quasi-static motion by solving a configuration-based optimization. The constraints in the 6D configuration space of the graphic tool is obtained and updated through online mapping of the nonpenetration constraint between the spheres of the graphic tool and those of the other objects in the three-dimensional physical space, based on the result of collision detection. This problem is further modeled as a quadratic programming optimization and solved by the classic active-set methods. Our algorithm has been implemented and interfaced with a 6-DOF Phantom Premium 3.0. We demonstrate its performance in several benchmarks involving complex, multiregion contacts. The experimental results show both the high efficiency and stability of haptic rendering by our method for complex scenarios. Nonpenetration between the graphic tool and the object is maintained under frequent contact switches. Update rate of the simulation loop including optimization and constraint identification is maintained at about 1 kHz.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2013.0

Hepatic sinusoidal perfusion is dysregulated during sepsis, contributing to liver injury. Therefore, the present study determined the effect of H2S on the hepatic microcirculation and the contribution of endogenous H2S to hepatic microcirculatory dysfunction in an endotoxin model of sepsis. Portal infusion of H2S increased portal pressure in vivo (6.8 ± 0.2 mmHg before H2S vs. 8.6 ± 0.8 mmHg peak during H2S infusion, P &gt; 0.05). Using intravital microscopy, we observed decreased sinusoidal diameter (6.2 ± 0.27 μm before H2S vs. 5.7 ± 0.3 μm after H2S, P &lt; 0.05) and increased sinusoidal heterogeneity during H2S infusion (P &lt; 0.05) and net constriction. Since hepatic H2S levels are elevated during sepsis, we used the cystathionine γ lyase inhibitor DL-propargylglycine (PAG) to determine the contribution of H2S to the hypersensitization of the sinusoid to the vasoconstrictor effect of endothelin-1 (ET-1). PAG treatment significantly attenuated the sinusoidal sensitization to ET-1 in endotoxin-treated animals. ET-1 infusion increased portal pressure to 175% of baseline in endotoxemic animals, which was reduced to 143% following PAG treatment (P &lt; 0.05). PAG abrogated the increase in sinusoidal constriction after ET-1 infusion in LPS-treated rats (30.9% reduction in LPS rats vs. 11.6% in PAG/LPS rats, P &gt; 0.05). Moreover, PAG treatment significantly attenuated the increase in NADH fluorescence following ET-1 exposure during endotoxemia (61 grayscale units LPS vs. 21 units in PAG/LPS, P &lt; 0.05), suggesting an improvement in hepatic oxygen availability. This study is the first to demonstrate a vasoconstrictor action of H2S on the hepatic sinusoid and provides a possible mechanism for the protective effect of PAG treatment during sepsis.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2013.0

The aim of the study was to examine the role of education in improving lifestyles among Iranian adolescents. Methods: This group randomized controlled trial was conducted during October 2010 until January 2011 in Tehran. Participants for this study were selected through a random sampling method and divided into intervention and control groupsThe intervention group received a six session course on healthy lifestyles and the control group received no intervention. The Adolescent Lifestyle Questionnaire (ALQ). was used for collecting data. Data were collected before the intervention, at a two week after participation time point, and a three month follow-up was conducted. Results: Overall, 365 (male: 173, female: 192). adolescents participated in the study. There were significant differences between boys and girls in terms of physical activity and social support (P<0.001). The boys had higher levels of physical activity than girls. Girls received more social support than boys. There were significant differences in the lifestyle scores between the intervention and control groups at follow-up (P<0.001).

Cumbres Bog is unusually deep (basal sediments extend 12 m below the surface) for its altitude (~3050 m a.s.l.) and we extracted 7 m core of continuous sediment below ~5 m of water and peat. The resulting record provides strong evidence of: a period of warming immediately after the LGM (~18-13 cal. kyr BP), a cool interval coinciding with the Younger Dryas (~12.8-11.5 cal. kyr BP), a warm stable period from 10 to 6 cal. kyr BP, and a cooler and highly variable climate interval after 6 cal. kyr BP. More specifically, pollen ratios and fossil diatoms indicate that cold periods generally match with previously identified periods of rapid climate change that occurred at 10.6, 8.7-7.9, 7.0-6.9, 5.4-5.2, 3.3-3.0, 2.3, 2.0 and 1.5 cal. kyr BP. This record also adds resolution to previous regional records and indicates that the periodicity of climate variability changed from 2000-3000 years to 700-1100 years around 6 cal. kyr BP and to <500 years after 3.5 cal. kyr BP.

Two such measures have been created but tested primarily in pregnant or postpartum populations. This study examined agreement between the pregnancy readiness measures in a diverse population of nonpregnant women. Methods: Women completed short questionnaires while waiting for clinical appointments. Participants' responses to the pregnancy readiness measures were cross-tabulated to assess the level of agreement between the measures. Logistic regression was used to determine factors related to disagreement between the measures. Complete information was available for 220 women. Results: Almost 55% of women had disagreement between the pregnancy readiness measures. Women with a high school education or less had 2.60 times the odds of disagreement (95% confidence interval 1.23-5.49), and women who did not use contraception had 2.40 times the odds of disagreement (95% confidence interval 1.18-4.87).

2-s2.0-84879523266,Article,"We present a multilevel modeling framework for simulating the emergence of landscape spatial structure in urbanizing regions using a combination of field-based and object-based representations of land change. The FUTure Urban-Regional Environment Simulation (FUTURES) produces regional projections of landscape patterns using coupled submodels that integrate nonstationary drivers of land change: per capita demand, site suitability, and the spatial structure of conversion events. Patches of land change events are simulated as discrete spatial objects using a stochastic region-growing algorithm that aggregates cell-level transitions based on empirical estimation of parameters that control the size, shape, and dispersion of patch growth. At each time step, newly constructed patches reciprocally influence further growth, which agglomerates over time to produce patterns of urban form and landscape fragmentation. Multilevel structure in each submodel allows drivers of land change to vary in space (e.g., by jurisdiction), rather than assuming spatial stationarity across a heterogeneous region. We applied FUTURES to simulate land development dynamics in the rapidly expanding metropolitan region of Charlotte, North Carolina, between 1996 and 2030, and evaluated spatial variation in model outcomes along an urban-rural continuum, including assessments of cell- and patch-based correctness and error. Simulation experiments reveal that changes in per capita land consumption and parameters controlling the distribution of development affect the emergent spatial structure of forests and farmlands with unique and sometimes counterintuitive outcomes.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2013.0

Data were from the 2007 U.S. National Health Interview Survey and its Complementary and Alternative Medicine supplement (n = 10,096, ages 50+, representing 89.5 million adults). Logistic analyses adjusted for the sampling design and were weighted for national representation. A sample representing 25 million older adults said they used CAM because a health care provider recommended it. Other reasons were recommendations by family, friends, or coworkers (20.2 million), ineffective conventional medicine (5.2 million), and costs of conventional medicine (4.0 million). In adjusted results, women were more likely than men to use CAM for all four reasons. African Americans and Hispanics were less likely than Whites to use CAM for most of these reasons. The uninsured were much more likely to use CAM because conventional medicine was too expensive. Those with higher incomes were less likely to do so. Older adults with chronic conditions, especially musculoskeletal conditions or depression, were more likely to use CAM for most of these reasons. Health providers may be particularly likely to recommend CAM for chronic conditions. These recommendations may be reinforced by limited efficacy of conventional medicine for these conditions and its cost. CAM and conventional medicines can interact, causing risks to health. It is, therefore, useful to help health care providers identify patients most likely to use CAM and their reasons for doing so.

While previous research recognizes these critical periods, some recent literature suggests that students may face a similar transitional period later in their academic careers as they advance into their major areas of study. To date, there has been a dearth of information exploring upper-level students' success and commitment to graduation. Exploring this later transition might provide a critical link to understanding the graduation gap between those students who persist to graduation and those who drop out.

Data collected from over 1,400 members of the American Planning Association are used to determine if urban planners' demographic characteristics influence attitudes about public-private partnerships designed to achieve different policy goals. By examining these linkages, conclusions can be drawn as to whether diversity in the planning profession offers a means of ensuring citizen preferences are taken into account when collaborative arrangements are formed to encourage urban development. Design/methodology/approach: Ordinal logistic regression models are estimated to determine if the characteristics of urban planners influence perceptions about real estate projects designed to: provide affordable housing; eliminate urban blight; encourage the use of public transportation; prevent urban sprawl; enhance pedestrian mobility; and preserve historic structures. Findings: Strong support for public-private partnerships was observed in the sample and demographic characteristics were found to influence attitudes. Minority planners tended to be more supportive of programs designed to provide affordable housing and eliminate blight, while female planners and planners in older age cohorts were more supportive of efforts to rejuvenate urban areas. Political ideology was, however, found to have the most consistent impact on attitudes. Originality/value: The paper's results suggest diversity in the planning profession offers one means of protecting citizen preferences when public-private partnerships are formed to encourage urban development.

2-s2.0-84879842229,Article,"Objective To test for an association between traditional nursing home quality measures and two sources of resident- and caregiver-derived nursing home complaints. Data Sources Nursing home complaints to the North Carolina Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program and state certification agency from October 2002 through September 2006 were matched with Online Survey Certification and Reporting data and Minimum Data Set Quality Indicators (MDS-QIs). Study Design We examine the association between the number of complaints filed against a facility and measures of inspection violations, staffing levels, and MDS-QIs. Data Extraction One observation per facility per quarter is constructed by matching quarterly data on complaints to OSCAR data from the same or most recent prior quarter and to MDS-QIs from the same quarter. One observation per inspection is obtained by matching OSCAR data to complaint totals from both the same and the immediate prior quarter. Principal Findings There is little relationship between MDS-QIs and complaints. Ombudsman complaints and inspection violations are generally unrelated, but there is a positive relationship between state certification agency complaints and inspection violations. Conclusions Ombudsman and state certification agency complaint data are resident- and caregiver-derived quality measures that are distinctive from and complement traditional quality measures.",Business,Economics,2013.0
2-s2.0-84879954806,Article,"In this paper, a cross-modal approach is developed for social image clustering and tag cleansing. First, a semantic image clustering algorithm is developed for assigning large-scale weakly-tagged social images into a large number of image topics of interest. Spam tags are detected automatically via sentiment analysis and multiple synonymous tags are merged as one super-topic according to their inter-topic semantic similarity contexts. Second, multiple base kernels are seamlessly combined by maximizing the correlations between the visual similarity contexts and the semantic similarity context, which can achieve more precise characterization of cross-modal (semantic and visual) similarity contexts among weakly-tagged social images. Finally, a K-way min-max cut algorithm is developed for social image clustering by minimizing the cumulative inter-cluster cross-modal similarity contexts while maximizing the cumulative intra-cluster cross-modal similarity contexts. The optimal weights for base kernel combination are simultaneously determined by minimizing the cumulative within-cluster variances. The polysemous tags and their ambiguous images are further split into multiple sub-topics for reducing their within-topic visual diversity. Our experiments on large-scale weakly-tagged Flickr images have provided very positive results.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2013.0

This adaptation process becomes especially challenging in the context of multiagent systems. In this paper, we argue that multiagent meta-level control is an effective way to determine when this adaptation process should be done and how much effort should be invested in adaptation as opposed to continuing with the current action plan. We use a reinforcement learning based local optimization algorithm within each agent to learn multiagent meta-level control agent policies in a decentralized fashion. These policies will allow each agent to adapt to changes in environmental conditions while reorganizing the underlying multiagent network when needed. We then augment the agent with a heuristic rule-based algorithm that uses information provided by the reinforcement learning algorithm in order to resolve conflicts among agent policies from a local perspective at both learning and execution stages. We evaluate this mechanism in the context of a multiagent tornado tracking application called NetRads. Empirical results show that adaptive multiagent meta-level control significantly improves the performance of the tornado tracking network for a variety of weather scenarios.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2013.0
2-s2.0-84880230583,Article,"Purpose: Continuously, optical and virtual image alignment can significantly supplement the clinical value of colonoscopy. However, the co-alignment process is frequently interrupted by non-informative images. A video tracking framework to continuously track optical colonoscopy images was developed and tested. Methods: A video tracking framework with immunity to non-informative images was developed with three essential components: temporal volume flow, region flow, and incremental egomotion estimation. Temporal volume flow selects two similar images interrupted by non-informative images; region flow measures large visual motion between selected images; and incremental egomotion processing estimates significant camera motion by decomposing each large visual motion vector into a sequence of small optical flow vectors. The framework was extensively evaluated via phantom and colonoscopy image sequences. We constructed two colon-like phantoms, a straight phantom and a curved phantom, to measure actual colonoscopy motion. Results: In the straight phantom, after 48 frames were excluded, the tracking error was < 3 mm of 16 mm traveled. In the curved phantom, the error was < 4 mm of 23.88 mm traveled after 72 frames were excluded. Through evaluations with clinical sequences, the robustness of the tracking framework was demonstrated on 30 colonoscopy image sequences from 22 different patients. Four specific sequences among these were chosen to illustrate the algorithm's decreased sensitivity to (1) fluid immersion, (2) wall contact, (3) surgery-induced colon deformation, and (4) multiple non-informative image sequences. Conclusion: A robust tracking framework for real-time colonoscopy was developed that facilitates continuous alignment of optical and virtual images, immune to non-informative images that enter the video stream. The system was validated in phantom testing and achieved success with clinical image sequences.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2013.0
2-s2.0-84880260183,Article,"Cooperative communication (CC) allows multiple nodes to simultaneously transmit the same packet to the receiver so that the combined signal at the receiver can be correctly decoded. Since the CC can reduce the transmission power and extend the transmission coverage, it has been considered in minimum energy routing protocols to reduce the total energy consumption. However, previous research on cooperative routing only focuses on minimizing the total energy consumption from the source node to the destination node, which may lead to the unbalanced energy distribution among nodes. In this paper, we aim to study the impact of cooperative routing on balancing the energy distribution among nodes. By introducing a new routing scheme which carefully selects cooperative relay nodes and assigns their transmission power, our cooperative routing method can balance the remaining energy among neighboring nodes to maximize the lifetime of the network. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed cooperative routing algorithm significantly balances the energy distribution and prolongs the lifetime of the network.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2013.0

The study also tests the moderator effect that decision environment may have on a mayor's qualifications in terms of education and experience. These effects were tested on data drawn from a survey-experiment whose subjects were 120 incumbent mayors representing 12 Latin American countries. Mayors were presented with a hypothetical municipal problem in which their decision consisted of dealing with the problem by themselves or by delegating spending authority to a private agency. After manipulating the salience of the municipal problem (education vs. infrastructure), stressful context (statement about presence of guerrillas vs. no statement), and choice constraint (capable vs. incapable delegated private agency), analysis of variance and logit results show that under no constraint, mayors tend to delegate spending authority to a private agency for dealing with education, but not for infrastructure problems. Findings may suggest that mayors see more opportunities for rent-seeking and/or political benefits from handling spending personally in infrastructure but not in education.

Asthma treatment guidelines outline the concept of a moderate asthma exacerbation; however, a clear definition that can be operationalized has not been proposed, Methods. Adult asthma (ICD-9: 493.XX) patients, with at least 9 months of continuous enrolment in the Fallon Community Health Plan were included in the retrospective cohort study. Patients diagnosed with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) or other lower respiratory tract conditions were excluded. The first reported asthma-related event following a 2-week symptom-free period was designated as the index event. Asthma-related events were categorized as (1) moderate exacerbations (symptom-based) or (2) severe exacerbations (claims-based). Timing between and temporal sequence of asthma-related events along with average costs were calculated, Results. Of 3126 eligible patients, 55% reported an asthma-related event followed by a recurrent event(s).

Conducting long-term studies in humans is difficult and costly, so the long-term consequences of an ankle sprain are not entirely known. PURPOSE: The objective of this study is to develop and test a mechanical ankle instability model in mice. METHODS: Thirty male mice (CBA/2J) were randomly placed into one of three groups: the transected calcaneal fibular ligament (CFL) group, the transected anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL)/CFL group, and a SHAM group. Three days after surgery, all of the mice were individually housed in a cage containing a solid surface running wheel, and daily running wheel measurements were recorded. Before and after surgery, measures of balance and gait were measured on all mice for 4 wk. RESULTS: The mice in the ATFL/CFL group had significantly decreased duration (P = 0.0239), distance (P = 0.013), and speed (P = 0.003) compared with the SHAM group during week 1. During weeks 2 and 3, the ATFL/CFL group had significantly less distance (P = 0.0001) and duration (P = 0.002) compared with the SHAM and CFL-only group. The transection of the lateral ankle ligaments did affect the number of slips experienced during the balance test. The ATFL/CFL group had greater slips at 1 and 4 wk postsurgery (P = 0.05), whereas the CFL-only group had greater slips at 3 d and 1 wk postsurgery (P = 0.05). Relative to the SHAM group, the ATFL/CFL group and CFL-only group had smaller right-stride lengths (involved limb) at 3 d postsurgery (P = 0.05).

2-s2.0-84880785856,Article,"The bacterial enzyme β-lactamase hydrolyzes the β-lactam ring of penicillin and chemically related antibiotics, rendering them ineffective. Due to rampant antibiotic overuse, the enzyme is evolving new resistance activities at an alarming rate. Related, the enzyme's global physiochemical properties exhibit various amounts of conservation and variability across the family. To that end, we characterize the extent of property conservation within twelve different class-A β-lactamases, and conclusively establish that the systematic variations therein parallel their evolutionary history. Large and systematic differences within electrostatic potential maps and pairwise residue-to-residue couplings are observed across the protein, which robustly reflect phylogenetic outgroups. Other properties are more conserved (such as residue pKa values, electrostatic networks, and backbone flexibility), yet they also have systematic variations that parallel the phylogeny in a statistically significant way. Similarly, the above properties also parallel the environmental condition of the bacteria they are from in a statistically significant way. However, it is interesting and surprising that the only one of the global properties (protein charge) parallels the functional specificity patterns; meaning antibiotic resistance activities are not significantly constraining the global physiochemical properties.

2-s2.0-84880888853,Article,"Background: Although prokaryotic gene transcription has been studied over decades, many aspects of the process remain poorly understood. Particularly, recent studies have revealed that transcriptomes in many prokaryotes are far more complex than previously thought. Genes in an operon are often alternatively and dynamically transcribed under different conditions, and a large portion of genes and intergenic regions have antisense RNA (asRNA) and non-coding RNA (ncRNA) transcripts, respectively. Ironically, similar studies have not been conducted in the model bacterium E coli K12, thus it is unknown whether or not the bacterium possesses similar complex transcriptomes. Furthermore, although RNA-seq becomes the major method for analyzing the complexity of prokaryotic transcriptome, it is still a challenging task to accurately assemble full length transcripts using short RNA-seq reads.Results: To fill these gaps, we have profiled the transcriptomes of E. coli K12 under different culture conditions and growth phases using a highly specific directional RNA-seq technique that can capture various types of transcripts in the bacterial cells, combined with a highly accurate and robust algorithm and tool TruHMM (http://bioinfolab.uncc.edu/TruHmm_package/) for assembling full length transcripts. We found that 46.9 ~ 63.4% of expressed operons were utilized in their putative alternative forms, 72.23 ~ 89.54% genes had putative asRNA transcripts and 51.37 ~ 72.74% intergenic regions had putative ncRNA transcripts under different culture conditions and growth phases.Conclusions: As has been demonstrated in many other prokaryotes, E. coli K12 also has a highly complex and dynamic transcriptomes under different culture conditions and growth phases. Such complex and dynamic transcriptomes might play important roles in the physiology of the bacterium. TruHMM is a highly accurate and robust algorithm for assembling full-length transcripts in prokaryotes using directional RNA-seq short reads.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2013.0

Normalized peak propulsive and braking forces were altered on both Day-1 and Day-10. Altered propulsive and braking forces persisted despite all concussion participants achieving their baseline values on standard concussion clinical tests. Thus gait termination can detect both acute and lingering motor control strategy alterations following concussion.",CHHS,Kinesiology,2013.0
2-s2.0-84881000765,Article,"Hurricane Katrina severely disrupted the lives of many children and families in the central Gulf Coast of the United States. Face-to-face interviews with child-caregiver dyads were conducted at approximately 1 year posthurricane (T1) and 6-10 months later (T2). The contribution of several factors-caregiver's self-reported symptomatology and coping advice and child perceptions of caregiver distress, unavailability, warmth, and caregiver-child conflict-to child-reported posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and depressive symptoms was examined. Findings provide partial support for the importance of the caregiving context to children's adjustment. Specifically, higher levels of caregiver-child conflict at T1 were associated with more PTSS at T2, controlling for baseline symptoms. In contrast, higher levels of caregiver education were negatively related to child PTSS at T2. After adjusting for objective hurricane exposure and symptoms at T1, none of the caregiving variables was related to child-reported depressive symptoms at T2. The implications of these findings for efforts to promote children's adjustment after disaster are discussed.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Psychology,2013.0

Specific kernels are learned not only for each label but also for each pair of the inter-related labels. By learning the eigenfunctions of the kernels, the similarity between a new data point and the training samples can be computed in the online mode.

2-s2.0-84881237813,Article,"Background: Controversy exists regarding the causative role of dietary fructose in obesity and fatty liver diseases. Clinical trials have indicated that negative health consequences may occur only when fructose is consumed within excess calories. Animal studies have suggested that fructose impairs intestinal integrity and leads to hepatic steatosis (HS). Objectives: We assessed nonhuman primates after chronic ad libitum and short-term calorically controlled consumption of a high-fructose (HFr), low-fat diet (24% of calories). Microbial translocation (MT), microbiome, and metabolic health indexes were evaluated. Design: Seventeen monkeys fed 0.3-7 y of an HFr ad libitum diet were compared with 10 monkeys fed a low-fructose, low-fat diet (control). Ten middle-aged, weight-stable, fructose-naive monkeys were stratified into HFr and control groups fed for 6 wk at caloric amounts required to maintain weight stability. Metabolic endpoints, feces, liver, small and large intestinal biopsies, and portal blood samples were collected. Results: Monkeys allowed ad libitum HFr developed HS in contrast to the control diet, and the extent of ectopic fat was related to the duration of feeding. Diabetes incidence also increased. Monkeys that consumed calorically controlled HFr showed significant increases in biomarkers of liver damage, endotoxemia, and MT indexes and a trend for greater hepatitis that was related to MT; however, HS did not develop. Conclusions: Even in the absence of weight gain, fructose rapidly causes liver damage that we suggest is secondary to endotoxemia and MT. HS relates to the duration of fructose consumption and total calories consumed. These data support fructose inducing both MT and ectopic fat deposition in primates.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2013.0

In light of this context, it is important to understand what skills managers need, and whether those skills are believed to be important to a manager's job similarly across countries or whether the importance is culturally contingent. Such knowledge will help managers and consultants understand what skills are important for effectiveness and success, and informs those who design and train managerial and leadership development initiatives about the appropriate and important content areas to cover. This study attempts to understand whether specific managerial skillsets (taking action, making decisions, and following through; relationships; energy, drive, and ambition) are believed to be important to a manager's job across 30 countries. We used ratings from the bosses of 6,130 target managers from 30 countries. With managers nested within countries and a binary outcome variable, the multilevel analysis of hierarchical generalized linear modeling (HGLM) was used in our analyses. Our findings suggest cultural convergence, in that the importance of these managerial skillsets was universally similar across the countries examined and not driven by cultural difference (which would have supported a divergence perspective).

2-s2.0-84881408612,Conference Paper,"The handle-avatar mapping from the handle of a desktop haptic device (i.e., the handle) to the virtual tool (i.e., the avatar) is subject to several uncertainties, including uncertain held positions of the human hand, un-modeled hand position on the virtual tool, and difference between the shape of the virtual tool and that of the physical handle. The influence of these uncertainties on the force/torque fidelity of 6-DOF haptic rendering is analyzed in this paper. A model of force/torque error induced by these uncertainties is introduced to measure the influences under different contact scenarios. A method based on adding a handle-hand avatar to the virtual tool is proposed to reduce the uncertainties and thus to improve simulation fidelity. Psychophysical experiments were carried out. Experiment results show that the subjective feeling of the human operator is consistent with the theoretical analysis results.

Therefore, understanding susceptibility to hyperoxia exposure is clinically important. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) 2 and 4 are involved in cardiac development and may influence responses to hyperoxia. Methods. Bmp2+/-. Bmp4+/- and wild-type mice were exposed to hyperoxia (100% O2) for 24 hrs. Electrocardiograms (ECG) were recorded before and during exposure by radio-telemetry. Results: At baseline, a significantly higher low frequency (LF) and total power (TP) heart rate variability (HRV) were found in Bmp2 +/- mice only (p &lt; 0.05). Twenty-four hours hyperoxia-induced strain-independent reductions in heart rate, QTcB and ST-interval and increases in QRS, LF HRV and standard deviation of RR-intervals were observed. In Bmp4+/- mice only, increased PR-interval (PR-I) (24 hrs), P-wave duration (P-d; 18 and 21-24 hrs), PR-I minus P-d (PR-Pd; 24 hrs) and root of the mean squared differences of successive RR-intervals (24 hrs) were found during hyperoxia (p &lt; 0.05). Discussion: Elevated baseline LF and TP HRV in Bmp2+/- mice suggests an altered autonomic nervous system regulation of cardiac function in these mice. However, this was not related to strain specific differences in responses to 24 hrs hyperoxia. During hyperoxia, Bmp4+/- mice were the most susceptible in terms of atrioventricular conduction changes and risk of atrial fibrillation, which may have important implications for patients treated with O2 who also harbor Bmp4 mutations. This study demonstrates significant ECG and HRV responses to 24 hrs hyperoxia in mice, which highlights the need to further work on the genetic mechanisms associated with cardiac susceptibility to hyperoxia.",CHHS,Kinesiology,2013.0

2-s2.0-84881537140,Article,"We use agent-based modeling approach to analyze the impact of various digital piracy control strategies on consumers, retailers, record labels, and artists. We model heterogeneous agent behavior, motives, and interactions to examine the consequences in terms of aggregate system behavior. Using a multi-agent programmable modeling environment (Netlogo), several experiments were conducted to test the simulation model and develop managerial insights. We show that an educational strategy is more effective when consumers are resistant to anti-piracy efforts and budgets for combating piracy are small. Furthermore, value-added service and low-price strategies should be used to encourage legitimate purchases since legal and educational strategies alone deter piracy but do not provide consumers' incentives to purchase legitimate products. Therefore, effectiveness of piracy control strategies can be improved by combining a legal or an educational strategy with a value-added or a low-price strategy. We also find that the profit-maximizing strategies are different for different players in the supply chain. While the record label prefers a low-cost strategy, it is optimal for the whole supply chain to use combined legal or educational strategy with a value-added strategy. Therefore, there is potential for all parties in the supply chain being better off if the record label and the retailer cooperate in combating piracy.",Business,BISOM,2013.0

There are time constraints and other practical considerations for those in the role of supervisor that may get in the way of supportive supervision unless supervisor support is recognized as a valuable business expense (Ellinger, 2013; Zeni, MacDougall, Chauhan, Brock, & Buckley, 2013). As such, in our response to the commentaries, we present the findings of an additional analysis based on the data from our original sample that examine the relationship between supportive supervision (as rated by subordinates) and supervisor performance and promotability (as rated by the supervisor's boss). We provide evidence that highly supportive supervisors are seen as more promotable and as better performers than are supervisors who are less supportive.

We found that highly supportive supervisors were more likely to see themselves as being warm and sociable, to think that their communication and leadership skills were their key strengths, and they were more involved in a variety of social and professional groups than less supportive supervisors. Supportive supervision is one way organizations can inexpensively work to build the job skills, abilities, and the interpersonal skills of organizational members.

However, it is also well-known that shortest path routing suffers from uneven distribution of traffic load, especially in dense wireless networks. Recently, several new routing protocols are proposed in order to balance traffic load among nodes in a network. One of them is circular sailing routing(CSR) [1], [2] which maps nodes on the surface of a sphere and select routes based on surface distances. CSR has been demonstrated with better load balance than shortest path routing via simulations. However, it is still open that what load distribution CSR can achieve. Therefore, in this paper, we theoretically analyze the traffic load distribution of CSR in a dense circular wireless network.

In this paper, we study the problem of enforcing edge differential privacy in graph generation. The idea is to enforce differential privacy on graph model parameters learned from the original network and then generate the graphs for releasing using the graph model with the private parameters. In particular, we develop a differential privacy preserving graph generator based on the dK-graph generation model. We first derive from the original graph various parameters (i.e., degree correlations) used in the dK-graph model, then enforce edge differential privacy on the learned parameters, and finally use the dKgraph model with the perturbed parameters to generate graphs. For the 2K-graph model, we enforce the edge differential privacy by calibrating noise based on the smooth sensitivity, rather than the global sensitivity. By doing this, we achieve the strict differential privacy guarantee with smaller magnitude noise. We conduct experiments on four real networks and compare the performance of our private dK-graph models with the stochastic Kronecker graph generation model in terms of utility and privacy tradeoff. Empirical evaluations show the developed private dK-graph generation models significantly outperform the approach based on the stochastic Kronecker generation model.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2013.0

Using a sample of 2,148 emerging adults nested within 1,074 dyadic friendships, this study separately investigates how concordance and discordance in binge drinking and marijuana use between friends is related to each friend's perceptions of friendship quality. Because ""friendship quality"" is a complex construct, we employ a measure containing five sub-elements - companionship, a lack of conflict, willingness to help a friend, relationship security, and closeness. Results for both binge drinking and marijuana use reveal that individuals in friendship pairs who are concordant in their substance use perceive significantly higher perceptions of friendship quality than individuals in dyads who are dissimilar in substance use. Specifically, concordant binge drinkers estimate significantly higher levels of companionship, relationship security, and willingness to help their friend than concordant non-users, discordant users, and discordant non-users. However, the highest amount of conflict in friendships is found when both friends engage in binge drinking and marijuana use. Several interpretations of these findings are discussed.

Such reproductive senescence in mid-lifespan is an evolutionary puzzle of enduring interest because it should be inherently disadvantageous. Furthermore, comparative data on reproductive senescence from other primates, or indeed other mammals, remains relatively rare. Here we carried out a unique detailed comparative study of reproductive senescence in seven species of nonhuman primates in natural populations, using long-term, individual-based data, and compared them to a population of humans experiencing natural fertility and mortality. In four of seven primate species we found that reproductive senescence occurred before death only in a small minority of individuals. In three primate species we found evidence of reproductive senescence that accelerated throughout adulthood; however, its initial rate was much lower than mortality, so that relatively few individuals experienced reproductive senescence before death. In contrast, the human population showed the predicted and well-known pattern in which reproductive senescence occurred before death for many women and its rate accelerated throughout adulthood. These results provide strong support for the hypothesis that reproductive senescence in midlife, although apparent in natural-fertility, natural-mortality populations of humans, is generally absent in other primates living in such populations.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Anthropology,2013.0

Mandated students who have violated campus alcohol policies often are at higher risk for heavy drinking and illicit drug use. Purpose: This longitudinal study compared the effectiveness of the Brief Motivational Intervention (BMI) in decreasing alcohol consumption and illicit drug use, as well as the associated negative consequences among mandated students (Group 1) and voluntary students (Group 2). Methods: Eligible participants (436 voluntary, 147 mandated, N = 583) who agreed to be in the study received the BMI at baseline and again at 2 weeks, with boosters at 3 months and 6 months. Descriptive statistics, frequency tables and summary graphs were used to summarize the study variables in both groups. Results: Alcohol and drug use in both groups decreased between baseline and 6 months, with drug use in the mandated group declining to 10% by 6 months. The consequences, including blackouts, decreased significantly for both groups at baseline and 3 months, and then plateaued at 6 months. Conclusions: The results from this study showed that the BMI was effective in decreasing alcohol consumption and illegal drug use, along with the associated negative consequences, among freshman students and voluntary students who were mandated to attend the program.",CHHS,Nursing,2013.0

Ten subjects, five with unilateral ankle osteoarthritis and five uninjured controls, participated. Subjects completed the SF-36 and Ankle Osteoarthritis Scale to quantify self-reported disability as well as 10 dual-limb static stance trials and 10 gait initiation trials with each leg. Center of pressure outcomes were calculated for static balance trials while the peak center of pressure excursions were calculated for each phase of gait initiation. The results indicate greater self-reported disability (P < .05) and worse static postural control (P < .05) in the ankle osteoarthritis group. Nonstereotypical patterns were also observed during the first and third phases of gait initiation in those with ankle osteoarthritis. The results of this pilot study suggest that supraspinal motor control mechanisms may have changed in those with posttraumatic ankle osteoarthritis.",CHHS,Kinesiology,2013.0

Most of previous work put their focus on the information propagation in static network. In this work, we examine two closely related problems on information propagation in predicable DTN. In particular, we assume that during a certain time period, the interacting process among nodes is known a priori or can be predicted. The first problem is to select a set of initial source nodes, subject to budget constraint, in order to maximize the total weight of nodes that receive the information at the final stage. This problem is well-known influence maximization problem which has been extensively studied for static networks. The second problem we want to study is minimum cost initial set problem, in this problem, we aim to select a set of source nodes with minimum cost such that all the other nodes can receive the information with high probability.

Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed among 42 278 US children who participated in the 2007 National Survey of Children's Health. Access to parks and recreational facilities was self-reported by parents, and body mass index was calculated from parents' self-report of the child's height and weight. Logistic regression was used to obtain ORs and 95% CIs. Since obesity was not a rare occurrence, an OR correction method was used to provide a more reliable estimate of the prevalence ratio (PR). Results: Children with access to parks and facilities had decreased prevalence of obesity as compared to children without access (PR=0.79, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.91). After adjustment for covariates, the magnitude of the association remained unchanged; however, results were no longer statistically significant (PR=0.77, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.07). Race/ethnicity was an effect modifier of the access-obesity relationship (p<0.0001). Among Non-Hispanic White children, there was no strong association (PR=0.89, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.23). However, among Non-Hispanic Black children, those who had access to recreational parks and facilities had 0.40 times the prevalence of obesity as compared to those without access, and this result was statistically significant (95% CI 0.17 to 0.90). Conclusions: This research highlights potential health disparities in childhood obesity due to limited access to recreational parks and facilities. Additional studies are needed to further investigate this association. If confirmed, providing safe, accessible parks and facilities may be one way to combat childhood obesity, particularly among minority children.",CHHS,Public Health,2013.0

2-s2.0-84883108376,Conference Paper,"Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) are gaining popularity due to their economical efficiency as well as their contribution to environmental preservation. PHEVs allow the driver to use exclusively electric power for 30-50 miles of driving, and switch to gasoline for longer trips. The more gasoline a vehicle uses, the higher cost is required for the trip. However, a PHEV cannot go long with its stored electricity without being recharged. Thus, it needs frequent recharging as compared to traditional engine vehicles powered by gasoline. Moreover, the battery recharging time is usually long, which leads to longer delays on a trip. Therefore, for the deployment of the PHEV technology it is necessary to provide a flexible navigation management scheme considering an efficient recharging scheduling, which allows choosing an optimal route based on the fuel-cost and time-to-destination constraints. In this paper, we show that this PHEV navigation management problem is NP-Complete and present a formal model to solve the problem using Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) that provides a vehicle driver a routing plan, as well as the potential charging points that satisfy the requirements (e.g., the maximum fuel cost and the maximum waiting time). We also present a price-based navigation control technique to achieve better load balance for the system.

However, current generation AI agents do not take advantage of the tactical abilities these mutable worlds provide. We propose a method to make the game agents aware of the mutability of the world by extending their repertoire of abilities to include world alteration commands and some evaluation functions, which determine when and where to alter the world for the greatest tactical gain. Primarily, our work focuses on the Adversarial Navigation Mesh Alteration (ANMA) algorithm, which evaluates potential changes to the map in adversarial environments from an attacker and defender point of view. We present an empirical evaluation of the ANMA algorithm in a Capture The Flag (CTF) simulation environment with several teams of agents. One group of agents (adaptive) lacks the ability to initiate world deformations, but they can respond and re-plan to take advantage of world modifications. The second team of agents (builders) can only generate additional paths through the world using the attacker portion of ANMA. The third team of agents (universal) is able to fully deform the world by generating new paths or removing existing paths using both the attacker and defender sections of ANMA. We evaluated these teams and observed that builder agents beat adaptive agents at a rate of 1.33 to 1.

It was predicted that these variables would be related to mothers' use of restriction, monitoring, and pressure in child feeding, influencing child adiposity. Design and Methods A total of 563 mothers (306 Hispanic, 76 Asian, 36 Black, and 145 White) with children aged 2-11 years completed the Child Feeding Questionnaire and Eating Attitudes Test. Analyses used structural equation modeling. Results Ethnic differences in the resulting models emerged. Mothers' weight status negatively predicted maternal control over child's eating; heavier mothers reported less control over child's eating. Greater concern about child's weight was associated with more maternal control of child's eating for all groups. Maternal control over child's eating was predictive of child's body mass index only in the White group. Conclusions Although maternal investment in eating-related issues did predict maternal control over child's eating for White mothers, this relationship did not exist for Hispanics. Different maternal factors influence mothers' control over their child's eating in Hispanic and White groups. In ethnic minorities, maternal control over child's eating may not influence child adiposity.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Psychology,2013.0
2-s2.0-84883219687,Conference Paper,"This paper presents a novel method to segment images and applies this method for segmenting bone fragments imaged using 3D Computed Tomography (CT). Existing image segmentation solutions tend to have difficulty in accurately delineating regions that have subtle variations along their boundaries or delineating regions which are spatially close. The proposed image segmentation algorithm introduces an original modification to the classical watershed transform and we refer to resulting approach as the Probabilistic Watershed Transform (PWT). The PWT uses a set of probability distributions to model the likelihood that a given pixel is a measurement obtained from each of the provided semantic classes. While the framework for the proposed PWT allows for completely general likelihood distributions, we specify several likelihood distributions which address known shortcomings in the watershed transform and, more generally, competing segmentation methods. Using these likelihood distributions, we apply the PWT to segment bone fragments within CT images of a bone fracture. A quantitative evaluation of the bone segmentation results is provided which compares our results with several leading competing methods as well as human-generated segmentation which show that the proposed method has some significant benefits for solving the bone fragment segmentation problem.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2013.0

2-s2.0-84883258607,Conference Paper,"In this paper, we present a technique that uses 3D shape grammars to segment and estimate rectilinear shapes in non-rectified images. While others have proposed the use of shape grammars for segmentation, i.e., assigning labels to rectangular 2D regions within rectified images, the proposed method is innovative for the following reasons: (1) it uses projections of 3D shapes to define non-rectangular segmentation regions and (2) the approach also estimates the unknown shape parameters of the imaged object. As others have done in the past, we require-user interaction to learn probability distributions for classifying pixels from the input image to each of the unknown classes. We then use a 3D shape grammar to hypothesize 3D models for the imaged object. A search procedure hypothesizes different 3D models by modifying the shape and pose parameters of the 3D shape grammar. The parameters of the hypothesized model that best fits the input image provide a segmentation of the image into semantic parts and shape estimates for each of the segmented parts. The key difference between the proposed approach and previous approaches is the 3D nature of our shape generation and estimation process which represents an advancement over existing approaches that are currently restricted to 2D representations.

Timely information on both (1) the spatial distribution of the disease, and (2) prevailing vulnerabilities of the population are needed to adequately plan targeted preventive intervention. We propose a methodology for the spatial assessment of current socioeconomic vulnerabilities to dengue fever in Cali, a tropical urban environment of Colombia.Methods: Based on a set of socioeconomic and demographic indicators derived from census data and ancillary geospatial datasets, we develop a spatial approach for both expert-based and purely statistical-based modeling of current vulnerability levels across 340 neighborhoods of the city using a Geographic Information System (GIS). The results of both approaches are comparatively evaluated by means of spatial statistics. A web-based approach is proposed to facilitate the visualization and the dissemination of the output vulnerability index to the community.Results: The statistical and the expert-based modeling approach exhibit a high concordance, globally, and spatially. The expert-based approach indicates a slightly higher vulnerability mean (0.53) and vulnerability median (0.56) across all neighborhoods, compared to the purely statistical approach (mean = 0.48; median = 0.49). Both approaches reveal that high values of vulnerability tend to cluster in the eastern, north-eastern, and western part of the city. These are poor neighborhoods with high percentages of young (i.e., < 15 years) and illiterate residents, as well as a high proportion of individuals being either unemployed or doing housework.Conclusions: Both modeling approaches reveal similar outputs, indicating that in the absence of local expertise, statistical approaches could be used, with caution. By decomposing identified vulnerability "" hotspots"" into their underlying factors, our approach provides valuable information on both (1) the location of neighborhoods, and (2) vulnerability factors that should be given priority in the context of targeted intervention strategies.

We suggest that the polymorphic MAOA gene may be partially responsible for variable susceptibility to environmental pressures and substance use. More specifically, we hypothesize that adolescents possessing low activity alleles for the MAOA genotype are more likely to respond to stressful life experiences by initiating substance use. Methods: The genetic subsample of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health was analyzed (2,574 adolescents) using logistic regression models for each gender. Respondents' self-reports of eight key stressors were used to create a composite life stress scale which was allowed to interact with a variable that represented the number of low activity MAOA alleles. Results: For males, a significant interaction emerged between stressful life experiences and the MAOA gene for alcohol (p=029) and marijuana (p=039) initiation. For females, the interaction was not significant in each model. Conclusions: MAOA interacts with life stress to increase the likelihood of substance use initiation for males.

2-s2.0-84883486468,Conference Paper,"The risk analysis is an important process for enforcing and strengthening efficient and effective security. Due to the significant growth of the Internet, application services, and associated security attacks, information professionals face challenges in assessing risk of their networks. The assessment of risk may vary with the enterprise's requirements. Hence, a generic risk analysis technique is suitable. Moreover, configuring a network with correct security policy is a difficult problem. The assessment of risk aids in realizing necessary security policy. Risk is a function of security threat and impact. Security threats depend on the traffic reachability. Security devices like firewalls are used to selectively allow or deny traffic. However, the connection between the network risk and the security policy is not easy to establish. A small modification in the network topology or in the security policy, can change the risk significantly. It is hard to manually follow a systematic process for configuring the network towards security hardening. Hence, an automatic generation of proper security controls, e.g., firewall rules and host placements in the network topology, is crucial to keep the overall security risk low. In this paper, we first present a declarative model for the qualitative risk analysis. We consider transitive reachability, i.e., reachability considering one or more intermediate hosts, in order to compute exposure of vulnerabilities. Next, we formalize our risk analysis model and the security requirements as a constraint satisfaction problem using the satisfiability modulo theories (SMT). A solution to the problem synthesizes necessary firewall policies and host placements.

Antiemetic medication for higher-risk patients may reduce but does not reliably prevent PON. We examined aromatherapy as a treatment for patients experiencing PON after ambulatory surgery. Our primary hypothesis was that in comparison with inhaling a placebo, PON will be reduced significantly by aromatherapy with (1) essential oil of ginger, (2) a blend of essential oils of ginger, spearmint, peppermint, and cardamom, or (3) isopropyl alcohol. Our secondary hypothesis was that the effectiveness of aromatherapy will depend upon the agent used. Methods: A randomized trial of aromatherapy with patients who reported nausea in the postanesthesia care unit was conducted at one ambulatory surgical center. Eligibility criteria were adult, able to give consent, and no history of coagulation problems or allergy to the aromatherapy agents. Before surgery, demographic and risk factors were collected. Patients with a nausea level of 1 to 3 on a verbal descriptive scale (0-3) received a gauze pad saturated with a randomly chosen aromatherapy agent and were told to inhale deeply 3 times; nausea (0-3) was then measured again in 5 minutes. Prophylactic and postnausea antiemetics were given as ordered by physicians or as requested by the patient. Results: A total of 1151 subjects were screened for inclusion; 303 subjects reporting nausea were enrolled (26.3%), and 301 meeting protocol were analyzed (26.2%). The change in nausea level was significant for the blend (P < 0.001) and ginger (P = 0.002) versus saline but not for alcohol (P < 0.76). The number of antiemetic medications requested after aromatherapy was also significantly reduced with ginger or blend aromatherapy versus saline (P = 0.002 and P < 0.001, respectively).

2-s2.0-84883744149,"General Publications (Press, Editorials, Letters)","When a study uses an ordinal outcome measure with unknown differences in the anchors and a small range such as 4 or 7, use of the Wilcoxon rank sum test or the Wilcoxon signed rank test may be most appropriate. However, because nonparametric methods are at best indirect functions of standard measures of location such as means or medians, the choice of the most appropriate summary measure can be difficult. The issues underlying use of these tests are discussed. The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney odds directly reflects the quantity that the rank sum procedure actually tests, and thus it can be a superior summary measure. Unlike the means and medians, its value will have a one-to-one correspondence with the Wilcoxon rank sum test result. The companion article appearing in this issue of Anesthesia & Analgesia (""Aromatherapy as Treatment for Postoperative Nausea: A Randomized Trial"") illustrates these issues and provides an example of a situation for which the medians imply no difference between 2 groups, even though the groups are, in fact, quite different. The trial cited also provides an example of a single sample that has a median of zero, yet there is a substantial shift for much of the nonzero data, and the Wilcoxon signed rank test is quite significant. These examples highlight the potential discordance between medians and Wilcoxon test results. Along with the issues surrounding the choice of a summary measure, there are considerations for the computation of sample size and power, confidence intervals, and multiple comparison adjustment.

Third, we turn to movement ecology and summarise recent, rapid developments in the types and quantities of available movement data, and in the statistical measures applicable to such data. Fourth, we discuss the advantages and interrelationships of diverse modelling approaches that have been used to explore the memory-movement interface. Finally, we outline key research challenges for the memory and movement communities, focusing on data needs and mathematical and computational challenges. We conclude with a roadmap for future work in this area, outlining axes along which focused research should yield rapid progress.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2013.0
2-s2.0-84883806310,Article,"The purpose of this study was to explore the lived experience of academic engagement of twelve Indonesian doctoral students attending an American graduate school during their first term and over time through demographic background surveys and semi-structured in-depth interviews. The research design was qualitative in the phenomenological approach (Creswell, 2007; Merriam, 1998; Moustakas, 1994; Patton, 1990). We analyzed our interviews data by using within-case and cross-case displays and analyses (Miles & Huberman, 1994) while we analyzed the demographic data descriptively. We identified five major themes related to Indonesian doctoral students' academic engagement experiences, including (a) academic workload, (b) unfamiliarity with classroom dynamics, (c) unfamiliarity with the nature of relationships between faculty and student, (d) personal conflicts with and unfair treatment from professors, and (e) linguistic barriers.

In the present study, we examined psychological- and physical-health impacts of exposure to these collective traumas. A U.S. national sample (N = 2,189) completed Web-based surveys 1 to 3 weeks after 9/11; a subsample (n = 1,322) also completed surveys at the initiation of the Iraq War. These surveys measured media exposure and acute stress responses. Posttraumatic stress symptoms related to 9/11 and physician-diagnosed health ailments were assessed annually for 3 years. Early 9/11- and Iraq War-related television exposure and frequency of exposure to war images predicted increased posttraumatic stress symptoms 2 to 3 years after 9/11. Exposure to 4 or more hr daily of early 9/11-related television and cumulative acute stress predicted increased incidence of health ailments 2 to 3 years later. These findings suggest that exposure to graphic media images may result in physical and psychological effects previously assumed to require direct trauma exposure.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Psychology,2013.0

The current study examines whether these samples provide meaningful insight into real offenders' decisions. Methods: A total of 760 undergraduates from a southwestern university and 1,013 offenders incarcerated in the same state were surveyed. Both groups were given a hypothetical drunk driving scenario and completed rational choice questions. Results: Results indicate that although the samples were very different in their background characteristics (e.g., age, sex, race, prior criminal history), they identified similar costs and benefits of drunk driving, gave similar ratings of the certainty/severity of these consequences, and utilized these consequences to inform their drunk driving intentions in a similar fashion. Conclusion: Despite social science being largely criticized as the ""study of sophomores,"" in this instance it appears college student samples can provide meaningful insight into the decision calculus of known offenders.

We hypothesized higher levels of Peace and Faith, but not Meaning, among Black and Hispanic survivors compared to White survivors, differences that would be reduced but remain significant after controlling for sociodemographic and medical factors. Hypotheses were tested with data from the American Cancer Society's Study of Cancer Survivors-II. The FACIT-Sp subscale scores, Meaning, Peace, and Faith assessed SWB, and the SF-36 Physical Component Summary measured functional status. In general, bivariate models supported our initial hypotheses. After adjustment for sociodemographic and medical factors, however, Blacks had higher scores on both Meaning and Peace compared to Hispanics and Whites, and Hispanics' scores on Peace were higher than Whites' scores. In contrast, sociodemographic and medical factors had weak associations with Faith scores. The pattern with Faith in bivariate models persisted in the fully adjusted models. Racial/ethnic differences in Meaning and in Peace, important dimensions of SWB, were even stronger after controlling for sociodemographic and medical factors. However, racial/ethnic differences in Faith appeared to remain stable. Further research is needed to determine if racial/ethnic differences in SWB are related to variations in quality of life in survivors of cancer.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Psychology,2013.0

Given voluntary participation and diversity of user behavior in VCs, this research attempts to explore the determinants of future participation that is critical to the survival of VCs. We investigate two intention-formation processes (non-conscious and conscious) through which previous experiences with a VC guide future behavior (continuance intention). Since those two processes may substitute each other, we also investigate the joint effect between them. To reflect the special features of VCs, we differentiate between two types of continuance intention - to consume and to provide information. Furthermore, for the non-conscious process, we compare two common measures of previous system usage, tenure and extent of usage. This is one of few IS studies that examines past behavior from multiple perspectives and explores its role in a non-traditional IS context. We also investigate four types of perceived benefits while examining the conscious decision making process. For the non-conscious process, we find that tenure and extent of usage play different roles in motivating users' continuance intentions. Tenure is shown to have a direct effect on continuance intention to consume information. Meanwhile, extent of usage is shown to have a direct effect on continuance intention to provide information. For the conscious decision making process, we find that perceived information and altruistic benefits encourage both continued consumption and provision behaviors. However, perceived social benefits do not play a significant role in the continuance intention to provide and perceived visibility benefits have no impact on continuance intention to consume. Based on the results, it is very important to differentiate consumption intention from provision intention, since they are affected by previous usage and perceived benefits differently.

Factors associated with inconsistent agreement between prospective and retrospective measurements of adherence also were explored. Study Design A total of 185 women participated in a longitudinal, prospective cohort of OC users, and 113 of these women provided complete information on OC adherence during follow-ups. Concordance beyond chance was assessed using weighted kappa statistics, and logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with inconsistent reporting of adherence. Results There was substantial agreement between prospective and retrospective adherence information (weighted kappa=0.64; 95% CI: 0.52-0.77). Participants with a high school education or less and those who had problems with feeling sad while using OCs had increased odds of inconsistent reporting of adherence (OR=4.38, 95% CI: 1.41-13.61 and OR=3.52, 95% CI: 1.25-9.94, respectively).

Design Twelve-month paired-facility two-arm (with one-arm crossover) randomized intervention trial. Setting Ten midwestern U.S. LTC facilities. Four treatment facilities received intervention during Months 1 to 12, four comparison facilities received intervention during Months 7 to 12, and two pseudo-control facilities received no intervention. Participants LTC facility residents (N = 1,928). Intervention All facility staff received in-person education, video, and handouts, and visiting family members received informational pamphlets on PU prevention and an intervention featuring musical cues. Nurse-led multidisciplinary staff teams presented the cues as prompts for staff and family to reposition residents or remind them to move. Musical selections (with and without lyrics) customized to facility preferences were played daily over the facility intercom or public address system every 2 hours for the 12-hour daytime period. Measurements Primary outcome measure was the frequency of new facility-acquired PUs divided by the total number of facility Minimum Data Set (MDS) resident assessments conducted during the study period. Results Odds of a new PU were lower in intervention facilities (P =.08) for MDS 2.0 assessments and were significantly lower (P =.05) for MDS 3.0. Mean odds ratios suggested intervention facility residents were 45% less likely than comparison facility residents to develop a new PU.

2-s2.0-84884301702,Conference Paper,"The U.S. Department of Labor (2005) has predicted an increase in demand for computer system analysts (29%), database administrators (37%), and software engineers (38%). Even with these increasing demands, there is a severe lack of representation of minority women in the field. Participation of women in computing and information technology, although never equitable, has declined during the past decade (Misa, 2010)1. With numerous reasons cited, including stereotypes of the field, a lack of role models, and a desire to help others, attracting and retaining women in the field is challenging; yet it is crucial to push the discipline forward. Human- Centered Computing (HCC) is a relatively new academic discipline concerned with computing and computational artifacts as they relate to the human condition. HCC attempts to solve realworld problems through the integration of computing with people, technology, information, policy and, sometimes, culture. While young, Clemson University's HCC program has the distinction of being the nation's first, and only, computing program at a major research institution that has a majority African-American and majority female enrollment.

2-s2.0-84884326083,Article,"Background: Differentiation and fusion of skeletal muscle myoblasts into multi-nucleated myotubes is required for neonatal development and regeneration in adult skeletal muscle. Herein, we report novel findings that protein kinase C theta (PKCθ) regulates myoblast differentiation via phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 and ERK1/2.Results: In this study, PKCθ knockdown (PKCθshRNA) myotubes had reduced inhibitory insulin receptor substrate-1 ser1095 phosphorylation, enhanced myoblast differentiation and cell fusion, and increased rates of protein synthesis as determined by [3H] phenylalanine incorporation. Phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 ser632/635 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) was increased in PKCθshRNA cells, with no change in ERK5 phosphorylation, highlighting a PKCθ-regulated myogenic pathway. Inhibition of PI3-kinase prevented cell differentiation and fusion in control cells, which was attenuated in PKCθshRNA cells. Thus, with reduced PKCθ, differentiation and fusion occur in the absence of PI3-kinase activity. Inhibition of the ERK kinase, MEK1/2, impaired differentiation and cell fusion in control cells. Differentiation was preserved in PKCθshRNA cells treated with a MEK1/2 inhibitor, although cell fusion was blunted, indicating PKCθ regulates differentiation via IRS1 and ERK1/2, and this occurs independently of MEK1/2 activation.Conclusion: Cellular signaling regulating the myogenic program and protein synthesis are complex and intertwined. These studies suggest that PKCθ regulates myogenic and protein synthetic signaling via the modulation of IRS1and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Myotubes lacking PKCθ had increased rates of protein synthesis and enhanced myotube development despite reduced activation of the canonical anabolic-signaling pathway. Further investigation of PKCθ regulated signaling may reveal important interactions regulating skeletal muscle health in an insulin resistant state.",CHHS,Kinesiology,2013.0

Using Kahn's theory of engagement, we look at an organizational context where employee engagement may be promoted-the workgroup meeting. Two time-separated Internet-based surveys were used to query a sample of working adults (N = 319). The findings provide support that the psychological conditions for engagement mediate the relationship between manager usage/facilitation of meetings and overall employee engagement. Specifically, as managers make their workgroup meetings relevant, allow for employee voice in their meetings where possible, and manage the meeting from a time perspective, employees appear poised to fully engage themselves in their work in general. The results suggest that managers can use a common workplace activity, workgroup meetings, to engage their employees when they use/facilitate meetings in an effective manner.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Psychology,2013.0

Design: Our study utilized data from the 2008 BRFSS to conduct a retrospective study and secondary data analysis. To account for the multistage survey design of BRFSS, SAS/SUDAAN was used to calculate adjusted and unadjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Multiple regression analysis was performed to examine the impact race and SES has on diabetes management among North Carolina adults. Results: The majority of the participants (63.34%) did not have good diabetes management based on the education and blood glucose criteria of our study. Non-Whites had higher odds than Whites to have good diabetes management practices (OR51.56, CI: 1.19, 2.03). Individuals who were low SES had poorer diabetes management than individuals who were identified as being high SES (OR5.81, CI: .60, 1.09). Conclusions: Disparities in good diabetes management practices were found among the variables of race, and SES. Findings from the study indicate that non-White adults had higher odds of good diabetes management practices than Whites in North Carolina. The results of this study could be used for policies and recommendations for health organizations. If health insurance policies required diabetes education classes a reduction in diabetes complications may be observed.

2-s2.0-84884412306,Article,"It has been proposed that supertree approaches should be applied to large multilocus datasets to achieve computational tractability. Large datasets such as those derived from phylogenomics studies can be broken into many locus-specific tree searches and the resulting trees can be stitched together via a supertree method. Using simulated data, workers have reported that they can rapidly construct a supertree that is comparable to the results of heuristic tree search on the entire dataset. To test this assertion with organismal data, we compare tree length under the parsimony criterion and computational time for 20 multilocus datasets using supertree (SuperFine and SuperTriplets) and supermatrix (heuristic search in TNT) approaches. Tree length and computational times were compared among methods using the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test. Supermatrix searches produced significantly shorter trees than either supertree approach (SuperFine or SuperTriplets; P < 0.0002 in both cases). Moreover, the processing time of supermatrix search was significantly lower than SuperFine+locus-specific search (P < 0.01) but roughly equivalent to that of SuperTriplets+locus-specific search (P > 0.4, not significant). In conclusion, we show by using real rather than simulated data that there is no basis, either in time tractability or in tree length, for use of supertrees over heuristic tree search using a supermatrix for phylogenomics.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2013.0

The formal test for beta convergence is an OLS regression with income change as the dependent variable and initial income as the predictor. Beta convergence is present when the coefficient on initial income is negative. Empirical evidence of convergence is mixed, however. We contend that omission of spatial effects, and the confounding problem of geographic scale, help explain inconsistent empirical findings. We, therefore, examine the role of spatial effects on the standard convergence model at three spatial scales-states, Economic Areas, and counties-in the United States from 1970 to 2004. Our results indicate failure to account for spatial and scalar effects can lead to conflicting results. Convergence evidence is strongest at smaller levels of spatial aggregation, yet model fit is better at larger levels. In addition, accounting for spatial effects improves model diagnostic performance but weakens convergence evidence.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2013.0

Specifically, the chapter presents a theoretical model to understand how affordances of social media promote or suppress entitativity. Methodology - Participants (N=265) were recruited through snowball sampling to answer questions about their recent Facebook status updates. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to examine the goodness of fit for our model. Findings - We validate a model of entitativity as it occurs through the affordances offered by social media. Participant's knowledge that status update responders were an interacting group outside of Facebook affected their perceptions of interactivity in the responses. Interactivity and history of interactions were the strongest predictors of status update entitativity. Further, status update entitativity had positive relationships with overall Facebook entitativity as well as group identity. Practical implications-To encourage group identity through social media, managers need to increase employees' perceptions of entitativity, primarily by enabling employees to see the interactions of others and to contribute content in social media platforms.

Oxidative stress agents include peroxides such as hydrogen peroxide, cumene hydroperoxide, and linoleic acid hydroperoxide, the thiol oxidant diamide, and menadione, a generator of superoxide, amongst others. The present study analyzed the early temporal genome-wide transcriptional response of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to oxidative stress induced by the aromatic peroxide cumene hydroperoxide. The accurate dataset obtained, supported by the use of temporal controls, biological replicates and well controlled growth conditions, provided a detailed picture of the early dynamics of the process. We identified a set of genes previously not implicated in the oxidative stress response, including several transcriptional regulators showing a fast transient response, suggesting a coordinated process in the transcriptional reprogramming. We discuss the role of the glutathione, thioredoxin and reactive oxygen species-removing systems, the proteasome and the pentose phosphate pathway. A data-driven clustering of the expression patterns identified one specific cluster that mostly consisted of genes known to be regulated by the Yap1p and Skn7p transcription factors, emphasizing their mediator role in the transcriptional response to oxidants. Comparison of our results with data reported for hydrogen peroxide identified 664 genes that specifically respond to cumene hydroperoxide, suggesting distinct transcriptional responses to these two peroxides.

In order to further clarify the nature of this relationship this research additionally examined the indirect effects of self-compassion on intuitive eating through the pathways of distress tolerance and body image acceptance and action using both parametric and non-parametric bootstrap resampling analytic procedures. Results based on responses to the self-report measures of the constructs of interest indicated that individual differences in body image acceptance and action (β= .31, p< .001) but not distress tolerance (β= .00, p= .94) helped explain the relationship between self-compassion and intuitive eating.

2-s2.0-84884596434,Article,"In recent years, a web phenomenon known as Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) has produced large crowdsourced geographic data sets. OpenStreetMap (OSM), the leading VGI project, aims at building an open-content world map through user contributions. OSM semantics consists of a set of properties (called 'tags') describing geographic classes, whose usage is defined by project contributors on a dedicated Wiki website. Because of its simple and open semantic structure, the OSM approach often results in noisy and ambiguous data, limiting its usability for analysis in information retrieval, recommender systems and data mining. Devising a mechanism for computing the semantic similarity of the OSM geographic classes can help alleviate this semantic gap. The contribution of this paper is twofold. It consists of (1) the development of the OSM Semantic Network by means of a web crawler tailored to the OSM Wiki website; this semantic network can be used to compute semantic similarity through co-citation measures, providing a novel semantic tool for OSM and GIS communities; (2) a study of the cognitive plausibility (i.e. the ability to replicate human judgement) of co-citation algorithms when applied to the computation of semantic similarity of geographic concepts.

2-s2.0-84884717730,Article,"Introduction and Aims: Until recently, synthetic cathinones marketed as 'bath salts' were legally sold at convenience stores and online in the USA. Media reports initiated concerns of a growing 'bath salt' epidemic. Despite media attention and the recent legal action banning synthetic cathinones, little is known about its prevalence or users. Design and Methods: A self-report survey was administered to 2349 students in 40 randomly selected courses at a large university in the Southeastern United States. The resulting sample was 51.6% female, 68.9% white, 24.4% black, 2.8% Hispanic and 4.0% other races, with a mean age of 20.06 years and median family income of $75000-99999. Results: Only 25 (1.07%) of the students reported using synthetic cathinones at least once. Synthetic cathinone use was found to be more common among men (1.68% vs. 0.50% of women, P=0.005), Hispanics (4.7%) and Native Americans (4.3% vs. 0.89% of whites and 0.72% of blacks, P=0.002), and student athletes (4.0% vs. 0.90% of non-athletes, P=0.001), but in each of these groups, synthetic cathinones were used more rarely than marijuana (58.14%, P<0.001), cocaine (9.08%, P<0.001), Salvia divinorum (7.89%, P<0.001), synthetic cannabinoids (14.28%, P<0.001), methamphetamines (1.92%, P=0.002), 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine (MDMA) (12.54%, P<0.001) and several other drugs and pharmaceuticals. Discussion and Conclusions: 'Bath salts' have received a great deal of media attention in the USA, yet the prevalence of synthetic cathinone use among our sample was extremely rare. We suggest that the media attention focusing on synthetic cathinone use as a growing epidemic may be largely misplaced. [Stogner JM, & Miller BL.

2-s2.0-84884891990,Article,"In delay tolerant networks (DTNs), the lack of continuous connectivity, network partitioning, and long delays make design of network protocols very challenging. Previous DTN research mainly focuses on routing and information propagation. However, with a large number of wireless devices' participation, it becomes crucial regarding how to maintain efficient and dynamic topology of the DTN. In this paper, we study the topology control problem in a predictable DTN, where the time-evolving network topology is known a priori or can be predicted. We first model such time-evolving network as a directed space-time graph that includes both spacial and temporal information. The aim of topology control is to build a sparse structure from the original space-time graph such that 1) the network is still connected over time and supports DTN routing between any two nodes; 2) the total cost of the structure is minimized. We prove that this problem is NP-hard, and propose two greedy-based methods that can significantly reduce the total cost of topology while maintaining the connectivity over time. We also introduce another version of the topology control problem by requiring that the least cost path for any two nodes in this constructed structure is still cost-efficient compared with the one in the original graph. Two greedy-based methods are provided for such a problem. Simulations have been conducted on both random DTN networks and real-world DTN tracing data.

Though also negatively related to religiosity, rational thinking style did not add significant unique effects, nor did it convey a significant indirect effect from cognitive ability. Experiential thinking was generally unrelated to ability but was positively related to some aspects of religiosity. Overall the results confirm that those with higher cognitive ability are less likely to accept religious doctrine or engage in religious behaviors and those with lower ability are more likely to accept religious doctrine and exhibit higher levels of fundamentalism. Cognitive style appears to play a lesser role in explaining individual differences in religiosity than cognitive ability.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Psychology,2013.0

This paper explores the efficacy with which eligible hospitals accomplish this goal by calculating a benefit-to-cost ratio (BCR) relative to the socio-demographic characteristics (population density, rate of poverty, and diversity) of the hospital's county. Eight states (CA, FL, GA, MN, MT, RI, TX, and WI) and 893 hospitals were included using data from 2007. A BCR of the dollars of charity care provided versus the dollars of federal tax exemption received was performed and sociodemographic characteristics were compared covariately to examine potential disparities. The study illustrates that for every dollar of exemption, the public received $0.11 of charity care. There is a statistically significant association between a higher percentage of diversity and poverty and a decrease in BCR; county level rates of poverty and diversity are negatively correlated with BCR and only 1 percent of hospitals have a cost-effective BCR. The investment in the charity care system is providing a very low rate of return and improvements or alternatives on the national scale should be considered.",CHHS,Public Health,2013.0
2-s2.0-84884940721,Conference Paper,"During deep brain stimulation (DBS) treatment of Parkinson disease, the target of the surgery is a small (9 x 7 x 4 mm) deep within brain placed structure called Subthalamic Nucleus (STN). It is similar morphologically to the surrounding tissue and as such poorly visible in CT or MRI. The goal of the surgery is the permanent precise placement of the stimulating electrode within target nucleus. Precision is extremely important as wrong placement of the stimulating electrode may lead to serious mood disturbances. To obtain exact location of the STN nucleus an intraoperative stereotactic supportive navigation is being used. A set of 3 to 5 parallel micro electrodes is inserted into brain and in measured steps advanced towards expected location of the nucleus. At each step electrodes record activity of the surrounding neural tissue. Because STN has a distinct physiology, the signals recorded within it also display specific features. It is therefore possible to provide analytical methods targeted for detection of those STN specific characteristics. Basing on such methods this paper presents clustering and classification approaches for discrimination of the micro electrode recordings coming from the STN nucleus. Application of those methods during the neurosurgical procedure might lessen the risks of medical complications and might also shorten the - out of necessity awake - part of the surgery.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2013.0

METHODS: Fourteen C57Bl/6J mice (seven males and seven females) were individually housed at 8 wk of age in cages with a running wheel, magnetic sensor, and digital odometer. Duration, distance, and running velocity were recorded daily. Fourteen additional mice C57Bl/6J mice (seven males and seven females) were placed in individual cages without running wheels at 8 wk of age. Pulsed-wave Doppler transmitral inflow recordings with a SONOS 5500 ultrasound and 15-6L ultrasound probe were used to image the left ventricle every 4 wk throughout the life span. RESULTS: Peak E wave filling velocities were significantly greater by the start of the second quarter of the life span in the mice with access to running wheels (P < 0.0001). Peak E wave velocities improved in both groups during the first half of the life span (P < 0.0001) and declined throughout the second half of the life span (P < 0.0001). Early-to-late (E:A) filling ratio was significantly greater for the physically active mice by the start of the second quarter of the life span (P < 0.0001) and continued throughout most of the remainder of the life span (P < 0.0001). No differences were observed between the two groups of mice with peak A wave filling velocities (P > 0.05). Similar findings were observed when corrected for resting heart rate. CONCLUSIONS: Lifelong physical activity resulted in greater diastolic filling parameters by the second quarter of the life span, highlighting the clinical importance of regular aerobic activity in young adulthood as a mechanism for improved left ventricular performance with aging.",CHHS,Kinesiology,2013.0
2-s2.0-84885008408,Conference Paper,"To assure high quality of database applications, testing database applications remains the most popularly used approach. In testing database applications, tests consist of both program inputs and database states. Assessing the adequacy of tests allows targeted generation of new tests for improving their adequacy (e.g., fault-detection capabilities). Comparing to code coverage criteria, mutation testing has been a stronger criterion for assessing the adequacy of tests. Mutation testing would produce a set of mutants (each being the software under test systematically seeded with a small fault) and then measure how high percentage of these mutants are killed (i.e., detected) by the tests under assessment. However, existing test-generation approaches for database applications do not provide sufficient support for killing mutants in database applications (in either program code or its embedded or resulted SQL queries). To address such issues, in this paper, we propose an approach called MutaGen that conducts test generation for mutation testing on database applications. In our approach, we first apply an existing approach that correlates various constraints within a database application through constructing synthesized database interactions and transforming the constraints from SQL queries into normal program code. Based on the transformed code, we generate program-code mutants and SQL-query mutants, and then derive and incorporate query-mutant-killing constraints into the transformed code. Then, we generate tests to satisfy query-mutant-killing constraints. Evaluation results show that MutaGen can effectively kill mutants in database applications, and MutaGen outperforms existing test-generation approaches for database applications in terms of strong mutant killing.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2013.0
2-s2.0-84885040877,Article,"This study adds to the growing body of research on work meetings and extends the emotional labour literature beyond a service context by examining the relationship between surface acting during meetings and perceived meeting effectiveness. Additionally, the relationships of surface acting during meetings and perceived meeting effectiveness with time-lagged reports of intention to quit and emotional exhaustion 3 months later were investigated. Structural equation modelling of data from 178 working adults revealed negative relationships between surface acting and perceptions of meeting effectiveness. Perceived meeting effectiveness partially mediated the relationship between surface acting and both intention to quit and emotional exhaustion 3 months later. These findings expand both the limited research on perceived meeting effectiveness and the surface acting nomological network to include a consideration that expressing inauthentic emotions in meetings (surface acting) may relate to the perceived effectiveness of the meeting. As well, both surface acting during meetings and perceived meeting effectiveness may relate to how emotionally exhausted employees feel and their intentions to seek other employment. Given the cost and pervasiveness of meetings in daily organizational life and their potential effects on the well-being of employees, understanding how to make meetings effective is paramount - particularly if researchers and practitioners want to better understand how perceived meeting effectiveness may be related to various employee outcomes.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Organizational Science,2013.0

2-s2.0-84885229390,Conference Paper,"Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) are gaining popularity due to their economical efficiency as well as their contribution to environmental preservation. PHEVs allow the driver to use exclusively electric power for 30-50 miles of driving, and switch to gasoline for longer trips. The more gasoline a vehicle uses, the higher cost is required for the trip. However, a PHEV cannot go long with its stored electricity without being recharged. Thus, it needs frequent recharging as compared to traditional engine vehicles powered by gasoline. Moreover, the battery recharging time is usually long, which leads to longer delays on a trip. Therefore, for the deployment of the PHEV technology it is necessary to provide a flexible navigation management scheme considering an efficient recharging scheduling, which allows choosing an optimal route based on the fuel-cost and time-to-destination constraints. In this paper, we show that this PHEV navigation management problem is NP-Complete and present a formal model to solve the problem using Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) that provides a vehicle driver a routing plan, as well as the potential charging points that satisfy the requirements (e.g., the maximum fuel cost and the maximum waiting time). We also present a price-based navigation control technique to achieve better load balance for the system.

VSL#3 (10 9 â.CFU/animal/day) significantly enhanced tumor penetrance, multiplicity, histologic dysplasia scores, and adenocarcinoma invasion relative to VSL#3-untreated mice. Illumina 16S sequencing demonstrated that VSL#3 significantly decreased (16-fold) the abundance of a bacterial taxon assigned to genus Clostridium in the mucosally-adherent microbiota.

2-s2.0-84885607371,Article,"A host of different types of information goods are available for free download from illegal file sharing sites. As far as price is concerned, no company can compete against ""free."" Hence, managers, researchers, and policy makers are interested in determining factors other than price that might influence consumers' file sharing behavior. Moral consideration is one factor that might sway individuals to pay for files they could otherwise obtain for free. To help better understand how moral consideration works in the context of file sharing, this research examines how people form perceptions of the legality and ethicalness of downloading music files through file sharing. We propose that when people receive files in a more restrictive manner (e.g. streaming vs. downloading) they are less likely to recognize file sharing as being unethical or illegal. We conduct five studies to test our theory of restrictiveness. The results consistently indicate that consumers' perceptions of legality and ethicalness of file sharing are associated with restrictiveness of use. In particular, while file sharing with different levels of restrictiveness still transfers intellectual property from one individual to another, increased restrictiveness results in consumers being less likely to identify file sharing as being illegal or unethical. This in turn has a great impact on their actual engagement in the unauthorized file sharing activities. We find the relationships are significant even when controlling for several other elements such as gender, age, income, and prior knowledge about how and where to go on the internet to participate in file sharing.",Business,Marketing,2013.0

Using a Geographic Information Systems-based approach, one-way travel time and distance to access medical care for children born with spina bifida was estimated. METHODS: Using 2007 road information from the Florida Department of Transportation, we built a topological network of Florida roads. Live-born Florida infants with spina bifida during 1998 to 2007 were identified by the Florida Birth Defects Registry and linked to hospital discharge records. Maternal residence at delivery and hospitalization locations were identified during the first year of life. RESULTS: Of 668 infants with spina bifida, 8.1% (n=54) could not be linked to inpatient data, resulting in 614 infants. Of those 614 infants, 99.7% (n=612) of the maternal residential addresses at delivery were successfully geocoded. Infants with spina bifida living in rural areas in Florida experienced travel times almost twice as high compared with those living in urban areas. When aggregated at county levels, one-way network travel times exhibited statistically significant spatial autocorrelation, indicating that families living in some clusters of counties experienced substantially greater travel times compared with families living in other areas of Florida. CONCLUSION: This analysis demonstrates the usefulness of linking birth defects registry and hospital discharge data to examine geographic differences in access to medical care.

The purpose of the study was to examine the effect of feedback in a signal detection task on perception of increased airflow obstruction in children with persistent asthma. Methods: The effect of feedback training on the perception of resistive loads was evaluated in 155 children with persistent asthma between 8 and 15 years of age. Each child participated in four experimental sessions that occurred approximately once every 2 weeks, an initial session followed by three training sessions. During the initial session, the threshold resistance to breathing was determined for each child. Subsequently, each child was randomly assigned to one of two resistive load training conditions in a signal detection paradigm: training with immediate performance feedback or training with no performance feedback. Results: The threshold resistance to breathing, determined in the initial session, was equivalent between groups. Children in the feedback condition discriminated more accurately between both the presence and the absence of increases in the resistance to breathing (206 [48] versus 180 [39] correct responses, p < .001), and differences over time between groups increased reliably as a function of training (165 [40] versus 145 [32] correct responses, p < .001).

2-s2.0-84886431277,Article,"Why do some autocratic states allocate more resources to the military than others? We contend that as narrow political interests have more influence on a leader, relative to broader political interests, a state's military burden increases. Further, we argue that two domestic factors are central to explaining the relative strength of narrow political interests for military spending, and therefore variation in state military burden. First, institutions that increase the cost of political participation reduce the influence of the median citizen, increasing the strength of narrow political interests and, concomitantly, military spending. Second, as a regime ages, narrow interests become more entrenched and the regime becomes less concerned about overthrow. In turn, older regimes spend more on their militaries. We test hypotheses from this argument by examining the military burden for all autocracies over the period 1950-2000. We find that variation in restrictions on political participation and the age of the regime are central to understanding differences in military spending among autocracies. Further, once these institutional features are taken into account, we find only modest support for the view that certain types of regimes spend more than others. What matters is not regime type but specific institutional features that affect the strength of narrow interests and vary across, and within, autocratic regimes.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Political Science and Public Administration,2013.0

Topic-based text summarization methods coupled with interactive visualizations have presented promising approaches to address the challenge of analyzing large text corpora. As the text corpora and vocabulary grow larger, more topics need to be generated in order to capture the meaningful latent themes and nuances in the corpora. However, it is difficult for most of current topic-based visualizations to represent large number of topics without being cluttered or illegible. To facilitate the representation and navigation of a large number of topics, we propose a visual analytics system-HierarchicalTopic (HT). HT integrates a computational algorithm, Topic Rose Tree, with an interactive visual interface. The Topic Rose Tree constructs a topic hierarchy based on a list of topics. The interactive visual interface is designed to present the topic content as well as temporal evolution of topics in a hierarchical fashion. User interactions are provided for users to make changes to the topic hierarchy based on their mental model of the topic space. To qualitatively evaluate HT, we present a case study that showcases how HierarchicalTopics aid expert users in making sense of a large number of topics and discovering interesting patterns of topic groups.

One way to think about it is to contrast a classical ""anthropological genetics"" (Roberts 1965), that is to say, a genetics that presumably informs anthropological issues or questions, with a ""genomic anthropology"" (Pálsson 2008), that is to say, an anthropology that complements and relativizes modern genomics (on the model of, say, medical anthropology and legal anthropology).1 This review argues that a principal contribution of anthropology to the study of human heredity lies in the ontology of genetic facts. For anthropology, genetic facts are not natural, with meanings inscribed on them, but are instead natural/cultural: The natural facts have cultural information (values, ideologies, meanings) integrated into them, not layered on them. To understand genetic facts involves confronting their production, which has classically been restricted to questions of methodology but which may be conceptualized more broadly. This review is not intended as a critique of the field of anthropological genetics, but as a reformulation of its central objects of study. I argue for reconceptualizing the ontology of scientific facts in anthropological genetics, not as (value-neutral) biological facts situated in a cultural context, but instead as inherently biocultural facts.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Anthropology,2013.0

To assess the consequences of cage microenvironment on the mouse gut microbiome, two groups of germ-free (GF) wild-type (WT) mice, one gavaged with a microbiota harvested from adult WT mice and another allowed to acquire the microbiome from the cage microenvironment, were monitored using Illumina 16S rRNA sequencing over a period of 8 weeks. Our results revealed that cage effects in WT mice moved from GF to specific pathogen free (SPF) conditions take several weeks to develop and are not eliminated by the initial gavage treatment. Initial gavage influenced, but did not eliminate a successional pattern in which Proteobacteria became less abundant over time. An analysis in which 16S rRNA sequences are mapped to the closest sequenced whole genome suggests that the functional potential of microbial genomes changes significantly over time shifting from an emphasis on pathogenesis and motility early in community assembly to metabolic processes at later time points. Functionally, mice allowed to naturally acquire a microbial community from their cage, but not mice gavaged with a common biome, exhibit a cage effect in Dextran Sulfate Sodium-induced inflammation. Our results argue that while there are long-term effects of the founding community, these effects are mitigated by cage microenvironment and successional community assembly over time, which must both be explicitly considered in the interpretation of microbiome mouse experiments.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2013.0

2-s2.0-84886790930,Article,"Background: The safety and efficacy of simultaneous or staged bilateral total knee arthroplasty have long been debated among orthopaedic surgeons. Advocates for simultaneous bilateral total knee arthroplasty posit that the benefits of decreased costs and recovery time, with no difference in functional outcomes, outweigh the economic costs of potential complications. The purpose of the study was to conduct a cost-utility analysis comparing simultaneous bilateral total knee arthroplasty with staged bilateral total knee arthroplasty. Methods: A Markov model was designed to compare the cost-effectiveness of simultaneous bilateral total knee arthroplasty with that of staged bilateral total knee arthroplasty. Nationwide Inpatient Sample data sets from 2004 to 2007 were used to identify 24,574 simultaneous and 382,496 unilateral procedures. On the basis of the codes of the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, perioperative complications were categorized as minor, major, and mortality, and respective probability values were calculated. Nationwide Inpatient Sample data were used to determine hospital costs conditional on procedure type and complications. Rehabilitation costs, anesthesia costs, and heath utilities were estimated from the literature. To minimize selection bias, propensity score matching was used to match the groups on comorbid conditions, socioeconomic variables, and hospital characteristics. Results: Using the matched sample, all complication rates were higher for the staged group. The estimated mean cost (in 2012 U.S. dollars) was $43,401 for simultaneous bilateral total knee arthroplasty compared with $72,233 for staged bilateral total knee arthroplasty. The quality-adjusted life years gained were 9.31 for simultaneous bilateral total knee arthroplasty and 9.29 for staged bilateral total knee arthroplasty. On the basis of these matched results, simultaneous bilateral total knee arthroplasty dominated staged bilateral total knee arthroplasty with lower costs and better outcomes. Conclusions: On the basis of this analysis, simultaneous bilateral total knee arthroplasty is more cost-effective than staged bilateral total knee arthroplasty, with lower costs and better outcomes for the average patient. These data can inform shared medical decision-making when bilateral total knee arthroplasty is indicated. Level of Evidence: Economic and decision analysis, Level II.

The offshore-indicative calcareous microfossil content of some storm deposits was taphonomically altered or destroyed, and in many cases cores taken 10 m apart provided signifi cantly different storm records. In several low-marsh cores, where bioturbation is more intense, storm deposits were completely unrecognizable using foraminifer or sedimentological analyses. In nearly all cores the sedimentary record of storm deposits was more extensive than the record produced using foraminifers, and, as a result, the sedimentary proxy produced shorter hurricane return periods. While offshore-indicative foraminifers in the salt marshes behind Folly Island are good indicators of their original source and mode of deposition (storm current transport from the shelf by overwash, storm inlet, or via Lighthouse Inlet), their susceptibility to destruction from bioturbation and dissolution suggests that they provide a less accurate or less complete record of storm frequency than previously thought.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2011.0

In previous studies, sense of humor was viewed as a one-dimensional, positive personal quality: the potential impact of maladaptive styles of humor was not acknowledged. The current study assesses both adaptive and maladaptive humor styles and relates them to perceived risk, and to the performance of risky behavior. The results do not support the suggestion that a sense of humor-when considered as a cheerful, carefree, and optimistic orientation-is related to assessments of risk or risky choices. Although humor styles did predict risk perception and risky behavior, it was the maladaptive, aggressive humor style that was related to a lower perception of risk, and higher rates of predicted and actual risky behavior. Humor styles that reflect a positive mindset, and that were predictive of less chronic worry, were not consistently or reliably associated with perceiving situations as less risky or with higher rates of risky behavior. Further research is needed to clarify why an aggressive humor style was predictive of risk assessment and risky choices.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Psychology,2013.0

By tracking the fine-detailed touch actions of the user, we build a ""touch-based biometrics"" model of the owner by extracting some principle features, and then verify whether the current user is the owner or guest/attacker. When using the smartphone, the unique operating pattern of the user is detected and learnt by collecting the sensor data and touch events silently. When users are mobile, the micro-movement of mobile devices caused by touch is suppressed by that due to the large scale user-movement which will render the touch-based biometrics ineffective. To address this, we integrate a movement-based biometrics for each user with previous touch-based biometrics.

Afterward, participants' real world attempts to follow-through on the opportunity were monitored covertly. Results: Findings reveal that participants who reported weak intentions to offend typically refrained from the act, resulting in a low false negative rate. However, those who reported strong intentions to offend also typically refrained from the act, thereby resulting in a high false positive rate. Conclusions: These findings suggest that while participants' predictions of criminal abstention are generally accurate, their predictions of criminal involvement are more problematic.

The automatic construction of cartograms within digital computing environments, as recognized in the literature, is impeded by the issue of computational efficiency. Parallel computing is a potential solution for tackling the computational issue of cartogram construction, and its importance is increasingly acknowledged with the wider spread and application of advanced cyberinfrastructure into geographic studies. The purpose of this article is to investigate the use of a state-of-the-art parallel computing approach, graphics processing units (GPUs), to accelerate the construction of large circular cartograms, a special form of area cartograms. GPUs, built on many-core computing architecture and thread parallelism, provide tremendous high-performance computing and even supercomputing support for general-purpose geocomputation. In this study, the construction of a circular cartogram is divided into a large number of fine-grained subtasks that can be efficiently and simultaneously computed on the underlying many-core GPUs. Simulated and real data were used in experiments to examine the computational performance of GPU-enabled construction of circular cartograms.

This study uses data from IPEDS and the American Community Survey to estimate the possible misrepresentation of reported bachelor degree completions by racial and ethnic group and citizenship status in the biological and biomedical sciences and engineering.

2-s2.0-84887196556,Article,"Parallel spatially explicit agent-based models (SE-ABM) exploit high-performance and parallel computing to simulate spatial dynamics of complex geographic systems. The integration of parallel SE-ABM with CyberGIS could facilitate straightforward access to massive computational resources and geographic information systems to support pre- and post-simulation analysis and visualization. However, to benefit from CyberGIS integration, parallel SE-ABM must overcome the challenge of communication management for orchestrating many processor cores in parallel computing environments. This paper examines and addresses this challenge by describing a generic framework for the management of inter-processor communication to enable parallel SE-ABM to scale to high-performance parallel computers. The framework synthesizes four interrelated components: agent grouping, rectilinear domain decomposition, a communication-aware load-balancing strategy, and entity proxies. The results of a series of computational experiments based on a template agent-based model demonstrate that parallel computational efficiency diminishes as inter-processor communication increases, particularly when scaling a fixed-size model to thousands of processor cores. Therefore, effective communication management is crucial. The communication framework is shown to efficiently scale up to 2048 cores, demonstrating its ability to effectively scale to thousands of processor cores to support the simulation of billions of agents. In a simulated scenario, the communication-aware load-balancer reduced both overall simulation time and communication percentage improving overall computational efficiency. By examining and addressing inter-processor communication challenges, this research enables parallel SE-ABM to efficiently use high-performance computing resources, which reduces the barriers for synergistic integration with CyberGIS.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2013.0

Electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD) is a digital microfluidic lab-on-a-chip technology that uses patterned electrodes for droplet manipulation. The main limitations of EWOD devices are the restrictions in volume and motion of droplets due to the fixed size, layout, and addressing scheme of the electrodes. Optoelectrowetting on dielectric (OEWOD) is a recent technology that uses optical sources and electric fields for droplet actuation on a continuous surface. We describe an open surface light-actuated OEWOD device that can manipulate droplets of multiple volumes ranging from 1 to 50 μL at voltages below 45 V. To achieve lower voltage droplet actuation than previous open configuration devices, we added a dedicated dielectric layer of high dielectric constant (Al2O 3 with εr of 9.1) and significantly reduced the thickness of the hydrophobic layer. The device is capable of transporting droplets at speeds as high as 12 mm/sec using a data projector as an optical source. We developed a multiple axis contact pad design to apply lateral electric fields along different axes to achieve multi-axis droplet movement.

The aim of this paper is to extend previous research by examining whether and how specific distal, narrow personality traits and the more proximal characteristic of political skill are related to decisiveness, a specific competency of leadership effectiveness, as rated from direct reports and peers. Design/methodology/approach: Self-report data on political skill and personality traits (i.e. perceptiveness and affability) from 225 practicing managers from the US, together with other-report (i.e. peer and subordinate) ratings of their leadership effectiveness (i.e. decisiveness) were used to test the mediating effects of political skill. Findings: Results show that political skill (i.e. the social astuteness dimension) mediated the relationships between narrow personality traits and evaluations of leadership effectiveness as rated by some, but not other rater sources. Specifically, the social astuteness dimension of political skill mediated the relationship between perceptiveness and decisiveness ratings from direct reports but not for ratings from peers, and the full political skill composite measure mediated the relationship between affability and decisiveness ratings from peers but not for ratings from direct reports. Research limitations/implications: Limitations include the availability of only two narrow personality traits, which constrained the scope of the possible mediation tests of all individual dimensions of political skill. Practical implications: Political skill is shown to be a more proximal predictor of leadership effectiveness than personality dimensions. Thus, political skill should be considered over personality for emerging leaders. Further, differences in ratings due to source (i.e. peer and subordinate) indicate the need for organizational leaders to consider the source when evaluating effectiveness reports.

The target concept appeared as a picture, an environmental sound, or both; and in bimodal trials, the audiovisual events were either consistent or inconsistent in their representation of a semantic concept. The results showed faster detection latencies to bimodal than to unimodal targets and a higher rate of missed targets when visual distractors were presented together with auditory targets, in comparison to auditory targets presented alone. The findings of Experiment 2 showed a cross-modal asymmetry, such that visual distractors were found to interfere with the accuracy of auditory target detection, but auditory distractors had no effect on either the speed or the accuracy of visual target detection. The biased-competition theory of attention (Desimone & Duncan Annual Review of Neuroscience 18: 1995; Duncan, Humphreys, & Ward Current Opinion in Neurobiology 7: 255-261 1997) was used to explain the findings because, when the saliency of the visual stimuli was reduced by the addition of a noise filter in Experiment 4, visual interference on auditory target detection was diminished.

We describe the approach of probabilistic data linkage as a means to address this critical issue. Methods: We employed a historical retrospective cohort design. Patients aged 40 and older with a principal or secondary diagnosis of COPD (ICD-9-CM codes 491.xx, 492.xx, and 496) and at least 3 years of continuous enrollment between January 1, 2004 and April 30, 2009 were selected from two US-based commercial administrative claims databases. The index date was designated as the date of the first claim (defined by a 12-month wash-out pre-index period) for the study drugs, for illustration purposes referred to as Treatment 1 or Treatment 2. The primary effectiveness measure was risk of any COPD-related exacerbation observed in the 12-month post-index period, with baseline characteristics being identified in the 12-month pre-index period. Results: The percentage of the study sample receiving Treatment 1 at index who had an exacerbation was 39.3% for Database A and 39.7% for Database B; for Treatment 2, the percentages were 46.3% and 47.1%, respectively.

Objectives: This paper, grounded in the theory of Andersen's Emerging Model of Health Services Utilization (Phase Four), includes race concordance between patients and their primary care providers as a predisposing characteristic and examines its effect on prescription drug utilization. Drug utilization was analyzed in terms of aggregated race concordance and dis-aggregated (stratified) race concordance. Methods: This study examines the experience of 1942 adults enrolled in North Carolina Medicaid's managed care delivery system in 2006-2007. Primary data were obtained from a computer assisted telephone survey that used the North Carolina Medicaid CAHPS 3.0 Adult Survey 2006 as the survey instrument and from enrollment data provided by plan administrators. Propensity score matching techniques sorted respondents on their propensity for race concordance and indices were constructed from survey indicators to generate key control variables. A nested logistic regression model analyzed prescription drug utilization. Results: The primary findings indicate that race concordance between survey respondents and primary care providers was not a significant predictor of prescription drug use when examining aggregated concordance, but was significant in the black concordant subgroup. Conclusions: The contradictory findings in the white and black subpopulations suggest that additional studies at the subpopulation level are required to resolve this dilemma. These studies should employ path analysis or structural equation modeling to examine the relationship between patients' trust, satisfaction, and race concordance with their providers. The current study makes a valuable contribution to the sparse body of literature describing the impact of race concordance on prescription drug use.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Political Science and Public Administration,2013.0
2-s2.0-84887859828,Article,"Background: Health care workers, such as nurses, nursing aides, orderlies, and attendants, who manually move patients, are consistently listed in the top professions for musculoskeletal injuries (MSIs) by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. These MSIs are typically caused by high-risk patient caregiving activities. In 2008, a safe patient handling (SPH) program was implemented in all 153 Veterans Administration Medical Centers (VAMCs) throughout the United States to reduce patient handling injuries. Objective: The goal of the present study is to evaluate the effects associated with the national implementation of a comprehensive SPH program. The primary objectives of the research were to determine the effectiveness of the SPH program in improving direct care nursing outcomes and to provide a context for understanding variations in program results across sites over time. Secondary objectives of the present research were to evaluate the effectiveness of the program in reducing direct and indirect costs associated with patient handling, to explore the potential mediating and moderating mechanisms, and to identify unintended consequences of implementing the program. Methods: This 3-year longitudinal study used mixed methods of data collection at 6- to 9-month intervals. The analyses will include data from surveys, administrative databases, individual and focus group interviews, and nonparticipant observations. For this study, a 3-tiered measurement plan was used. For Tier 1, the unit of analysis was the facility, the data source was the facility coordinator or administrative data, and all 153 VAMCs participated. For Tier 2, frontline caregivers and program peer leaders at 17 facilities each completed different surveys. For Tier 3, six facilities completed qualitative site visits, which included individual interviews, focus groups, and nonparticipant observations. Multiple regression models were proposed to test the effects of SPH components on nursing outcomes related to patient handling. Content analysis and constant comparative analysis were proposed for qualitative data analysis to understand the context of implementation and to triangulate quantitative data. Results: All three tiers of data for this study have been collected. We are now in the analyses and writing phase of the project, with the possibility for extraction of additional administrative data. The focus of this paper is to describe the SPH program, its evaluation study design, and its data collection procedures. This study evaluates the effects associated with the national implementation of a comprehensive SPH program that was implemented in all 153 VAMCs throughout the United States to reduce patient handling injuries. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the largest evaluation of an SPH program in the United States. A major strength of this observational study design is that all VAMCs implemented the program and were included in Tier 1 of the study; therefore, population sampling bias is not a concern. Although the design lacks a comparison group for testing program effects, this longitudinal field study design allows for capturing program dose-response effects within a naturalistic context. Implementation of the VA-wide SPH program afforded the opportunity for rigorous evaluation in a naturalistic context. Findings will guide VA operations for policy and decision making about resources, and will be useful for health care, in general, outside of the VA, in implementation and impact of an SPH program.",CHHS,Nursing,2013.0

All atomic action terms on the left-hand side of an action rule have to be covered by well chosen meta-actions in order for it to be executed. The choice of meta-actions depends on the antecedent side of action rules; however, it also depends on their list of atomic actions that are outside of the action rule scope, seen as side effects. In this paper, we strive to minimize the side effects by decomposing the left-hand side of an action rule into executable action rules covered by a minimal number of meta-actions and resulting in a cascading effect. This process was tested and compared to original action rules. Experimental results show that side effects are diminished in comparison with the original meta-actions applied while keeping a good execution confidence. ding effect.

We can treat the pathways of scientific communication as a network. When we do, it becomes clear that the interaction between the structure of the network and the nature of the question under investigation affects epistemic desiderata, including accuracy and speed to community consensus. Here we build on previous work, both our own and others', in order to get a firmer grasp on precisely which features of scientific communities interact with which features of scientific questions in order to influence epistemic outcomes. Here we introduce a measure on the landscape meant to capture some aspects of the difficulty of answering an empirical question. We then investigate both how different communication networks affect whether the community finds the best answer and the time it takes for the community to reach consensus on an answer. We measure these two epistemic desiderata on a continuum of networks sampled from the Watts-Strogatz spectrum. It turns out that finding the best answer and reaching consensus exhibit radically different patterns. The time it takes for a community to reach a consensus in these models roughly tracks mean path length in the network. Whether a scientific community finds the best answer, on the other hand, tracks neither mean path length nor clustering coefficient.",Business,Economics,2013.0

Monitoring antibiotic susceptibility is crucial to managing patient care. We identified the rapid emergence of a ceftazidime-resistant strain in a single patient within four days during a hospitalization for treatment of an exacerbation. Methods: B. multivorans was isolated from expectorated sputum samples using Burkholderia cepacia selective agar. A macrodilution assay was performed on all isolates to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration of ceftazidime. Approximately 4000 colonies were scored to identify the percent of ceftazidime-resistant colonies. Extracted DNA was used to determine the total bacterial counts and abundance of B. multivorans using quantitative PCR. Results: An increase from no detectable B. multivorans ceftazidime-resistant colonies to over 75% of all colonies tested occurred within a four-day period. The resistant population remained dominant in 6 of the 8 samples in the following 17. months of the study. qPCR revealed an association between change in the percent of resistant colonies and abundance of B. multivorans, but not of total bacteria. No association was found between the acquisition of resistance to ceftazidime and other antibiotics commonly used to treat B. multivorans infections. Conclusions: The rapid emergence of a ceftazidime-resistant by B. multivorans strain occurred during a hospitalization while under selective pressure of antibiotics. The resistant strain maintained dominance in the B. multivorans population which resulted in an overall decline in a patient health and treatment efficacy.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2013.0

METHODS: Databases maintained by nurses, program staff, and school personnel were integrated into a single AEP Evaluation Database. RESULTS: There were a number of positive findings, including evidence that students with an elevated level of need received priority from AEP. A series of dependent group t tests analyzing changes across time in students' grade-point averages and absences, as well as their implications, also demonstrated some improvements. Additional outcome analyses for the 296 students who received case management services demonstrated further program benefits in the areas of attendance, academic performance, behavior, and quality of life.

2-s2.0-84888068400,Article,"High-spatial resolution remote sensing imagery provides unique opportunities for detailed characterization and monitoring of landscape dynamics. To better handle such data sets, change detection using the object-based paradigm, i.e., object-based change detection (OBCD), have demonstrated improved performances over the classic pixel-based paradigm. However, image registration remains a critical pre-process, with new challenges arising, because objects in OBCD are of various sizes and shapes. In this study, we quantified the effects of misregistration on OBCD using high-spatial resolution SPOT 5 imagery (5. m) for three types of landscapes dominated by urban, suburban and rural features, representing diverse geographic objects. The experiments were conducted in four steps: (i) Images were purposely shifted to simulate the misregistration effect. (ii) Image differencing change detection was employed to generate difference images with all the image-objects projected to a feature space consisting of both spectral and texture variables. (iii) The changes were extracted using the Mahalanobis distance and a change ratio. (iv) The results were compared to the 'real' changes from the image pairs that contained no purposely introduced registration error. A pixel-based change detection method using similar steps was also developed for comparisons. Results indicate that misregistration had a relatively low impact on object size and shape for most areas. When the landscape is comprised of small mean object sizes (e.g., in urban and suburban areas), the mean size of 'change' objects was smaller than the mean of all objects and their size discrepancy became larger with the decrease in object size. Compared to the results using the pixel-based paradigm, OBCD was less sensitive to the misregistration effect, and the sensitivity further decreased with an increase in local mean object size. However, high-spatial resolution images typically have higher spectral variability within neighboring pixels than the relatively low resolution datasets. As a result, accurate image registration remains crucial to change detection even if an object-based approach is used.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2014.0

InstaflexTM is a joint pain supplement containing glucosamine sulfate, methylsufonlylmethane (MSM), white willow bark extract (15% salicin), ginger root concentrate, boswella serrata extract (65% boswellic acid), turmeric root extract, cayenne, and hyaluronic acid. Methods. Subjects included 100 men and women, ages 50-75 years, with a history (>3 months) of joint pain, and were randomized to Instaflex™ or placebo (3 colored gel capsules per day for 8 weeks, double-blind administration). Subjects agreed to avoid the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) and all other medications and supplements targeted for joint pain. Primary outcome measures were obtained pre- and post-study and included joint pain severity, stiffness, and function (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities [WOMAC]), and secondary outcome measures included health-related quality of life (Short Form 36 or SF-36), systemic inflammation (serum C-reactive protein and 9 plasma cytokines), and physical function (6-minute walk test). Joint pain symptom severity was assessed bi-weekly using a 12-point Likert visual scale (12-VS). Results: Joint pain severity was significantly reduced in Instaflex™ compared to placebo (8-week WOMAC, ↓37% versus ↓16%, respectively, interaction effect P = 0.025), with group differences using the 12-VS emerging by week 4 of the study (interaction effect, P = 0.0125). Improvements in ability to perform daily activities and stiffness scores in Instaflex™ compared to placebo were most evident for the 74% of subjects reporting knee pain (8-week WOMAC function score, ↓39% versus ↓14%, respectively, interaction effect P = 0.027; stiffness score, ↓30% versus ↓12%, respectively, interaction effect P = 0.081). Patterns of change in SF-36, systemic inflammation biomarkers, and the 6-minute walk test did not differ significantly between groups during the 8-week study. Conclusions: Results from this randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled community trial support the use of the Instaflex™ dietary supplement in alleviating joint pain severity in middle-aged and older adults, with mitigation of difficulty performing daily activities most apparent in subjects with knee pain.

Studies are needed to systematically assess barriers to use of comprehensive and exclusive VA healthcare services from the perspective of veterans with polytrauma and with other complex health outcomes following their service in Afghanistan and Iraq. These perspectives can inform policy with regard to the optimal delivery of care to returning veterans. Methods. We studied combat veterans (n = 359) from two polytrauma rehabilitation centers using structured clinical interviews and qualitative open-ended questions, augmented with data collected from electronic health records. Our outcomes included several measures of exclusive utilization of VA care with our primary exposure as reported access barriers to care. Results: Nearly two thirds of the veterans reported one or more barriers to their exclusive use of VA healthcare services. These barriers predicted differences in exclusive use of VA healthcare services. Experiencing any barriers doubled the returnees' odds of not using VA exclusively, the geographic distance to VA barrier resulted in a 7 fold increase in the returnees odds of not using VA, and reporting a wait time barrier doubled the returnee's odds of not using VA. There were no striking differences in access barriers for veterans with polytrauma compared to other returning veterans, suggesting the barriers may be uniform barriers that predict differences in using the VA exclusively for health care. Conclusions: This study provides an initial description of utilization of VA polytrauma rehabilitation and other medical care for veteran returnees from all military services who were involved in combat operations in Afghanistan or Iraq.

2-s2.0-84888362751,Article,"Elderly diagnosed with dementia are three times more likely to fall and over three times more likely to have severe injury compared to cognitively unimpaired elderly. Consequently, there is a need to identify biomarkers that can facilitate early detection, diagnosis, and progression of dementia. One of the characteristics of dementia is the inability to allocate attentional resources to concurrent tasks. Consequently, recent studies have used walking gait in conjunction with another cognitive or motor task to identify biomarkers related to the disease. However, in every study all temporal-spatial gait descriptors are being evaluated and, typically, the nonspecific velocity, double limb support, and stride variability are reported as significant. The purpose, therefore, of this investigation was to use a computational approach to first establish a dementia-specific gait profile irrespective of walking condition (talking, without talking) using the minimum number of temporal-spatial gait descriptors, second to investigate the effect of condition, and third to investigate the effect of an everyday realistic cognitive perturbation, resulting in potential falls, by constructing an index of responsiveness. Six normal elderly and seven diagnosed with dementia walked on an instrumented walkway: (i) without talking, (ii) conversing with an investigator, and (iii) conversing with an investigator, but including as part of the conversation a cognitive perturbation in the form of an unexpected direct question. To accomplish the first two goals we implemented signal detection theory combined with receiver operator characteristic curves. Based on these results we constructed the index of responsiveness that we compared between the two cohorts. Only six of thirteen gait variables were needed to distinguish individuals with dementia from normally aging, irrespective of whether gait was used as a stand-alone task, i.e., without talking, or under a dual-task paradigm, i.e., combined with a conversation. Double limb support was the most sensitive variable to describe adaptation to walking condition. The index of responsiveness was significantly larger for individuals with dementia. The six discriminating temporal-spatial gait descriptors provide new focus for health care professionals involved in diagnosis and treatment of elderly with dementia.

To that end, we have developed homology modeling and assessment protocols so that we can robustly calculate QSFR properties for proteins without experimentally derived structures.

The DCM outputs a large number of structural characterizations that collectively allow for Quantified Stability-Flexibility Relationships (QSFR) to be identified and compared across protein families. Using five metallo-β- lactamases (MBLs) as a representative set, we demonstrate how QSFR properties are both conserved and varied across protein families. Similar to our characterizations on other protein families, the backbone flexibility of the five MBLs are overall visually conserved, yet there are interesting specific quantitative differences. For example, the plasmid-encoded NDM-1 enzyme, which leads to a fast spreading drug-resistant version of Klebsiella pneumoniae, has several regions of significantly increased rigidity relative to the other four. In addition, the set of intramolecular couplings within NDM-1 are also atypical. While long-range couplings frequently vary significantly across protein families, NDM-1 is distinct because it has limited correlated flexibility, which is isolated within the active site S3/S4 and S11/H6 loops.

Unfortunately, none of them can be successfully applied to polyphonic sounds. Identification of music instruments in polyphonic sounds is still difficult and challenging. This has stimulated a number of research projects on music sound separation, new features development, and more recently on hierarchically structured classifiers used in content-based music recommender systems. This paper introduces a hierarchically structured cascade classification system to estimate multiple timbre information from the polyphonic sound by classification which is based on acoustic features and short-term power spectrum matching. This cascade system makes a first estimate on the higher level decision attribute which stands for the musical instrument family. Then, the further estimation is done within that specific family range. Experiments showed better performance of a hierarchical system than the traditional flat classification method which directly estimates the instrument without higher level of family information analysis. Traditional hierarchical structures were constructed in human semantics, which are meaningful from human perspective but not appropriate for a cascade system. We introduce a new hierarchical instrument schema according to the clustering results of the acoustic features. This new schema better describes the similarity among different instruments or among different playing techniques of the same instrument.

Findings: The results supported a curvilinear relationship, with youngest and oldest workers having the fewest conflicting demands between work and home. Further, the results demonstrated that family satisfaction and the age of the youngest child help explain why these workers are less likely to experience family interference with work. Finally, work hours were found to mediate the relationship between age and work interference with family.

2-s2.0-84889024610,Conference Paper,"The inherent design of anomaly detection systems (ADSs) make them highly susceptible to evasion attacks and hence their wide-spread commercial deployment has not been witnessed. There are two main reasons for this: 1) ADSs incur high false positives; 2) Are highly susceptible to evasion attacks (false negatives). While efforts have been made to minimize false positives, evasion is still an open problem. We argue that ADSs design is inherently flawed since it relies on the ADS's detection logic and feature space which is trivial to estimate. In information security e.g. cryptographic algorithms (such as DES), security is inherently dependent upon the key and not the algorithm, which makes these systems very robust by rendering evasion computationally infeasible. We believe there is a need to redesign the anomaly detection systems similar to cryptographic systems. We propose to randomize the feature space of an ADS such that it acts as a cryptographic key for the ADS and hence this randomized feature space is used by the ADS logic for detection of anomalies. This would make the evasion of the ADS computationally infeasible for the attacker.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2013.0

For safe and sustainable functioning of the grid, controlling the operations is very crucial. In this paper, we are offering an approach for vehicle-to-grid management using constraint-based formal modeling. The approach is centered around an aggregator that collects all the involved parties' constraints and preferences. The aggregator then finds a management plan, i.e., a schedule of V2G services for the PEVs by satisfying the given constraints besides its own requirements.

In this paper, we tackle a significant challenge facing scientists when analyzing outputs of a computational model, namely how to identify, examine, compare, and group interesting neighborhoods of proteins under different parameter sets. This is a difficult task since comparisons over protein subunits that comprise diverse neighborhoods are often too complex to characterize with a simple metric and too numerous to analyze manually.

Smart grids provide bi-directional communication between meters and headend system through Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI). Recent studies highlight the threats targeting AMI. Despite the need of tailored Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) for the smart grid, very limited progress has been made in this area. Unlike traditional networks, smart grid has its own unique challenges, such as limited computational power devices and potentially high deployment cost, that restrict the deployment options of intrusion detectors. We show that smart grid exhibits deterministic and predictable behavior that can be accurately modeled to develop intrusion detection system. In this paper, we show that AMI behavior can be modeled using event logs collected at smart collectors, which in turn can be verified using the specifications invariant generated from the configurations of the AMI devices. Event logs are modeled using fourth order Markov Chain and specifications are written in Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). The approach provides robustness against evasion and mimicry attacks, however, we discuss that it still can be evaded to a certain extent.

The present study aimed to define a mechanistic link between the increased glucocorticoids and alcoholic fatty liver in mice. Plasma corticosterone levels were not affected in mice on a 2-wk ethanol diet regimen but significantly increased upon 4 wk of ethanol ingestion. Accordingly, hepatic triglyceride levels were not altered after 2 wk of ethanol ingestion but were elevated at 4 wk. Based on the observation that 2 wk of ethanol ingestion did not significantly increase endogenous corticosterone levels, we administered exogenous glucocorticoids along with the 2-wk ethanol treatment to determine whether the elevated glucocorticoid contributes to the development of alcoholic fatty liver. Mice were subjected to ethanol feeding for 2 wk with or without dexamethasone administration. Hepatic triglyceride contents were not affected by either ethanol or dexamethasone alone but were significantly increased by administration of both. Microarray and protein level analyses revealed two distinct changes in hepatic lipid metabolism in mice administered with both ethanol and dexamethasone: accelerated triglyceride synthesis by diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2 and suppressed fatty acid β-oxidation by long-chain acyl- CoA synthetase 1, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a, and acyl-CoA oxidase 1. A reduction of hepatic peroxisome proliferation activator receptor-α (PPAR-α) was associated with coadministration of ethanol and dexamethasone. These findings suggest that increased glucocorticoid levels may contribute to the development of alcoholic fatty liver, at least partially, through hepatic PPAR-α inactivation.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2013.0

With the increasing number of VCs and low switching cost, it is challenging to retain existing users and encourage their continued participation. By integrating the IS post-adoption research and IS Success model, we propose a research framework to investigate VC users' continuance intention from a quality perspective. Based on a field survey, we find that information and system quality directly affect perceived individual benefits and user satisfaction, which ultimately determine user continuance intention to consume and to provide information. Furthermore, by modeling information quality and system quality as multifaceted constructs, our results reveal key quality concerns in information-exchange VCs. Implications for VC design and management are also discussed.",Business,BISOM,2013.0

2-s2.0-84889587593,Conference Paper,"Ranking fraud in the mobile App market refers to fraudulent or deceptive activities which have a purpose of bumping up the Apps in the popularity list. Indeed, it becomes more and more frequent for App develops to use shady means, such as inflating their Apps' sales or posting phony App ratings, to commit ranking fraud. While the importance of preventing ranking fraud has been widely recognized, there is limited understanding and research in this area. To this end, in this paper, we provide a holistic view of ranking fraud and propose a ranking fraud detection system for mobile Apps. Specifically, we investigate two types of evidences, ranking based evidences and rating based evidences, by modeling Apps' ranking and rating behaviors through statistical hypotheses tests. In addition, we propose an optimization based aggregation method to integrate all the evidences for fraud detection. Finally, we evaluate the proposed system with real-world App data collected from the Apple's App Store for a long time period. In the experiments, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed system, and show the scalability of the detection algorithm as well as some regularity of ranking fraud activities.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2013.0

That is, humanists must be open to working with scientists and social scientists interested in similar research questions and vice versa. Digital humanities is a positive first step. Complexity science should be the next step. Even though much of the ground-breaking work in complexity science has been done in the natural sciences and mathematics, it can, if critically adapted, provide the needed metaphor for a broad integration of disciplines, humanistic and otherwise.

2-s2.0-84889680583,Conference Paper,"Spatially heterogeneous patterns of land use in urban environments have long posed a challenge to remote sensing. High spatial resolution passive sensors provide detailed data of urban regions at sub meter level but are frequently limited by shadows of the built environment. Moderate resolution data can provide synoptic perspectives of such landscapes but tend to obscure information of spectrally similar objects. Due to its height-above-ground component, which is unaffected by shadows, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data are increasingly being used as an alternative to passive sensors. However, LiDAR's intensity component is infrequently utilized in urban studies presumably because its range of digital number values is similar between urban impervious and tree canopy covers. Previous investigations have concentrated on mapping either tree canopy or buildings using local-scale normalization procedures but the use of normalized intensity to map multiple land-use types in a heterogeneous urban landscape at a regional scale has received little attention. Our approach uniquely utilizes normalized intensity data in combination with structural components derived from LiDAR masspoints using maximum likelihood estimation of land use classes. Preliminary results show that our approach accurately distinguishes impervious surfaces and tree canopy over broad metropolitan contexts, with an overall accuracy of 96.7% for the ML classification of integrated LiDAR. In summary, we found that normalized LiDAR intensity data can be integrated with LiDAR surface models improving our ability to map heterogeneous urban geographies.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2010.0

2-s2.0-84890041294,Article,"Purpose: To build a statistical model to quantitatively correlate the anatomic features of structures and the corresponding dose-volume histogram (DVH) of head and neck (HN) Tomotherapy (Tomo) plans. To study if the model built upon one intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) technique (such as conventional Linac) can be used to predict anticipated organs-at-risk (OAR) DVH of patients treated with a different IMRT technique (such as Tomo). To study if the model built upon the clinical experience of one institution can be used to aid IMRT planning for another institution. Methods: Forty-four Tomotherapy intensity modulate radiotherapy plans of HN cases (Tomo-IMRT) from Institution A were included in the study. A different patient group of 53 HN fixed gantry IMRT (FG-IMRT) plans was selected from Institution B. The analyzed OARs included the parotid, larynx, spinal cord, brainstem, and submandibular gland. Two major groups of anatomical features were considered: the volumetric information and the spatial information. The volume information includes the volume of target, OAR, and overlapped volume between target and OAR. The spatial information of OARs relative to PTVs was represented by the distance-to-target histogram (DTH). Important anatomical and dosimetric features were extracted from DTH and DVH by principal component analysis. Two regression models, one for Tomotherapy plan and one for IMRT plan, were built independently. The accuracy of intratreatment-modality model prediction was validated by a leave one out cross-validation method. The intertechnique and interinstitution validations were performed by using the FG-IMRT model to predict the OAR dosimetry of Tomo-IMRT plans. The dosimetry of OARs, under the same and different institutional preferences, was analyzed to examine the correlation between the model prediction and planning protocol. Results: Significant patient anatomical factors contributing to OAR dose sparing in HN Tomotherapy plans have been analyzed and identified. For all the OARs, the discrepancies of dose indices between the model predicted values and the actual plan values were within 2.1%. Similar results were obtained from the modeling of FG-IMRT plans. The parotid gland was spared in a comparable fashion during the treatment planning of two institutions. The model based on FG-IMRT plans was found to predict the median dose of the parotid of Tomotherapy plans quite well, with a mean error of 2.6%. Predictions from the FG-IMRT model suggested the median dose of the larynx, median dose of the brainstem and D2 of the brainstem could be reduced by 10.5%, 12.8%, and 20.4%, respectively, in the Tomo-IMRT plans. This was found to be correlated to the institutional differences in OAR constraint settings. Re-planning of six Tomotherapy patients confirmed the potential of optimization improvement predicted by the FG-IMRT model was correct. Conclusions: The authors established a mathematical model to correlate the anatomical features and dosimetric indexes of OARs of HN patients in Tomotherapy plans. The model can be used for the setup of patient-specific OAR dose sparing goals and quality control of planning results. The institutional clinical experience was incorporated into the model which allows the model from one institution to generate a reference plan for another institution, or another IMRT technique.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2013.0

The current study examined change in PTG over 2 years following breast cancer diagnosis and variables associated with PTG over time. Methods Women recently diagnosed with breast cancer completed surveys within 8 months of diagnosis and 6, 12, and 18 months later. Linear mixed effects models were used to assess the longitudinal effects of demographic, medical, and psychosocial variables on PTG as measured by the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI). Results A total of 653 women were accrued (mean age = 54.9, SD = 12.6). Total PTGI score increased over time mostly within the first few months following diagnosis. In the longitudinal model, greater PTGI scores were associated with education level, longer time since diagnosis, greater baseline level of illness intrusiveness, and increases in social support, spirituality, use of active-adaptive coping strategies, and mental health.

In Pool 6 of the UMRS, deposition over the last 40 years has produced substantial island growth. To understand patterns of land growth in Pool 6, and what has enabled it, historical aerial photography and survey datasets were analyzed using a spatially nested approach. Between 1895 and 1931, land emerged around wing and closing dikes. Within the 29.9 km2 managed channel, land area increased 22%, with a 40% increase in land area in the 3.65 km2 lower pool. Following construction of the Lock and Dam system in 1936, which raised water levels, land area declined 45% in the pool and 78% in its downstream portion, or lower pool. Since 1975, land grew throughout the pool, and particularly in the lower pool. In this area, 0.37 km2 of island area has emerged, increasing land area by 88% relative to 1975. Around one island complex in the lower pool, sediments have aggraded 2.2 m in 111 years, with the Lock and Dam having only a slight effect on aggradation rate. The location of wing and closing dikes in a wide secondary channel within an overall constricted river width appears to have contributed to island emergence and growth.

Although churches are an important partner for improving health within the African American community, it is not known how congregants are best reached by health promotion activities and thus how best to target members in recruitment. This study examined how characteristics of churches and congregants' beliefs and interests in faith-based health promotion related to their willingness to attend church-based health promotion activities. Method. We surveyed adult congregants (n = 1,204) of 11 predominately African American churches in North Carolina. Surveys collected data within four domains: demographics (age, sex, education), behavioral (church attendance, respondent food choices, and physical activity), cognitive (church-based health promotion belief, Bible-based healthy living interest, healthy living resource interest), or environmental (family health, church travel distance, church health ministry activity, church members' food choices). Analyses used a dichotomous outcome, interest in attending programs offered by the health ministry. Domain-specific models were constructed. Logistic generalized estimating equations adjusted for clustering. Results. Of the 1,204 congregants, 72% were female, 57% were 50 years or older, 84% had a high school education or more, and 77% had a chronic health condition. In bivariate analyses and in models adjusting for all four domains, cognitive factors had the highest odds of willingness to attend. Conclusion.

However, compliant motion planners in the literature have focused on planning a compliant path in the task space in terms of contact configurations of one part with respect to the other. Little addressed is the issue of ensuring that such a compliant path not only satisfies contact constraints but also satisfies the manipulator constraints when converted automatically to a joint-space path for the manipulator to execute without singularities and unintended collision. Moreover, compliant control strategies are often based on force sensing in task space. In this paper, we describe a method to convert automatically a complex compliant path in the task space for assembly into a singularity-free joint space trajectory for a redundant manipulator to execute. A 7-DOF Barrett WAM and hand are used for this study. We further introduce a control scheme based on limiting computed joint torques without the presence of a force/torque sensor. We have validated our approach in an assembly experiment and tested alternative compliant paths of different sequences of contact state transitions by successful execution. This demonstrates that the surface assembly can be accomplished robustly through offline planned sequences of contact state transitions, even without on-line force/torque sensing.

Indeed, this paper provides a study of exploiting online travel information for personalized travel package recommendation. A critical challenge along this line is to address the unique characteristics of travel data, which distinguish travel packages from traditional items for recommendation. To that end, in this paper, we first analyze the characteristics of the existing travel packages and develop a tourist-area-season topic (TAST) model. This TAST model can represent travel packages and tourists by different topic distributions, where the topic extraction is conditioned on both the tourists and the intrinsic features (i.e., locations, travel seasons) of the landscapes. Then, based on this topic model representation, we propose a cocktail approach to generate the lists for personalized travel package recommendation. Furthermore, we extend the TAST model to the tourist-relation-area-season topic (TRAST) model for capturing the latent relationships among the tourists in each travel group. Finally, we evaluate the TAST model, the TRAST model, and the cocktail recommendation approach on the real-world travel package data. Experimental results show that the TAST model can effectively capture the unique characteristics of the travel data and the cocktail approach is, thus, much more effective than traditional recommendation techniques for travel package recommendation.

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that sequence polymorphisms in the U3R region of LTR are associated with IU MTCT. To this end, we used single template amplification to isolate 517 U3R sequences from maternal, placental, and infant plasma derived from 17 HIV-infected Malawian women: eight whose infants remained HIV uninfected (NT) and nine whose infants became HIV infected IU. U3R sequences show pairwise diversities ranging from 0.2% to 2.3%. U3R sequences from one participant contained two, three, or four putative NF-κB binding sites. Phylogenetic reconstructions indicated that U3R sequences from eight of nine IU participants were consistent with placental compartmentalization of HIV-1 while only one of eight NT cases was consistent with such compartmentalization. Specific TF sequence polymorphisms were not significantly associatd with IU MTCT. To determine if replication efficiency of the U3R sequences was associated with IU MTCT, we cloned 90 U3R sequences and assayed promoter activity in multiple cell lines. Although we observed significant, yet highly variable promoter activity and TAT induction of promoter activity in the cell lines tested, there was no association between measured promoter activity and MTCT status. Thus, we were unable to detect a promoter genotype or phenotype associated with IU MTCT.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2014.0

Proceeds from transactions involving nonprofit hospitals, health systems, and health plans will endow philanthropic foundations, collectively known as health legacy foundations. Building on work by Grantmakers In Health, we undertook a systematic search for these foundations and generated a newly updated, comprehensive database. We found 306 organizations in forty-three states that have been endowed with proceeds from the sale, merger, lease, joint venture, or other restructuring of nonprofit health care assets. These health legacy foundations had $26.2 billion in assets in 2010. Concentrated in the southern United States, foundations originating from hospitals and specialty care facilities (86.6 percent) held mean assets of $64.7 million per funder and typically restricted grants to local communities. Foundations formed from health plans (13.4 percent) held higher mean assets ($222 million), usually served larger areas, and were more likely to engage in health care advocacy.

Whereas historical records of hurricanes along the Atlantic coast are limited to the past 300 years, and reliable instrumental records extend back only half that length of time, proxy records taken from coastal sedimentary archives offer the potential to extend this record several thousand years, offering better statistical constraints on hurricane prediction. Two primary proxies have been the most studied during the last decade: sedimentary criteria and microfossils. In this study, we used a microfossil-based proxy-displaced marine foraminifers-to investigate a 1500-year paleostorm record of Onslow Bay, North Carolina, USA, and to compare marsh sediments and foraminifers pre- and post-Hurricane Irene, which made landfall in Onslow Bay on 27 August 2011. We found fewer hurricanes archived in the 1500 years of back-barrier marsh strata than have made landfall in Onslow Bay since 1950. This absence of preserved hurricane deposits, as well as the lack of a definitive signature from Hurricane Irene, suggests that caution should be used with respect to the sensitivity of sedimentological or micropaleontological proxies in paleotempestology studies. We conclude that, at best, only direct strikes from intense storms are being preserved, and it is likely Hurricane Irene's landfall will not be detectable in the future in the marginal-marine sediments from this region.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2013.0

In this article, we suggest and show how such behaviors vary by the race-specific character of manager-subordinate dyads. Drawing on organizational demography literature (that emphasizes ascriptive differences between superiors and subordinates) and literatures on racial stereotyping (that suggest ways in which minority supervisors are viewed as less competent than White supervisors), we test hypotheses that minority and White employees have different responses to minority and White managers' MCBs. Analyses of the 2002 National Survey of the Changing Workforce reveal that in cross-race dyads managers' relational competence significantly increases subordinates' commitment and job satisfaction. Managers' technical competence, in contrast, increases subordinates' commitment, satisfaction, and (to a lesser extent) mental health, but only in same-race dyads. Our findings suggest that managers who competently organize the workplace and show respect for workers' rights can potentially transcend racial differences in the workplace. In the process, worker well-being and employee commitment can be enhanced.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Sociology,2014.0

The SMT formalization is flexible to be applied to other threshold based cloud file distribution system and can accommodate other constraints.

We suggest and evaluate 2 competing hypotheses: that popularity within a network insulates females from sexual victimization and that popularity may increase exposure to delinquent others and facilitate sexual victimization. Results suggest that popularity does not have a consistent effect but instead that its role is conditioned by the deviance of the network. Popularity is associated with an increase in the likelihood of victimization when peer deviance is high but with a decrease when peer deviance is low.

Agents play an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma game with their immediate neighbors and offer commitments to their wealthiest neighbors in order to form coalitions. A commitment proposal, that includes a high breaching penalty, incentivizes opponent agents to form coalitions within which they mutually cooperate and thereby increase their payoff. We have analytically determined, and experimentally substantiated, how the value of the penalty should be set with respect to the minimum node degree and the payoff values such that convergence into optimal coalitions is possible.

We model such a network as a node-weighted space-time graph which includes both spacial and temporal information. To reduce the cost of supporting time-evolving networks with limited harvesting energy sources, we propose a new efficient topology design problem which aims to put more sensors into sleep while still maintaining the network connectivity over time. We prove that the optimization problem of finding the optimal awake sensor set with the minimum total cost is NP-hard.

If properly analyzed, this data could be a source of rich intelligence for providing real-time decision making and for the provision of travel tour recommendations. However, tour recommendation is quite different from traditional recommendations, because the tourist's choice is affected directly by the travel costs, which includes both financial and time costs. To that end, in this article, we provide a focused study of cost-aware tour recommendation. Along this line, we first propose two ways to represent user cost preference. One way is to represent user cost preference by a two-dimensional vector. Another way is to consider the uncertainty about the cost that a user can afford and introduce a Gaussian prior to model user cost preference. With these two ways of representing user cost preference, we develop different cost-aware latent factor models by incorporating the cost information into the probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF) model, the logistic probabilistic matrix factorization (LPMF) model, and the maximum margin matrix factorization (MMMF) model, respectively.

Existing jigsaw puzzle assembly algorithms have difficulty solving this problem effectively. A main limitation of these methods is that they do not leverage the following important observations: 1) an intact banknote's image is known and thus can be used as prior information; 2) if two aligned fragments overlap each other, they must not be from a same banknote. Based on these two important observations, a three-step method is proposed to reconstruct banknotes from their fragments. Each fragment is first aligned to its original position on the banknote by a RANSAC method. After evaluating every two aligned fragments' relationships, all fragments are embedded into a lower dimensional space and then clustered into small groups using a modified agglomerative clustering method. Fragments in a same cluster are likely to be from a same banknote. Experiments on both synthetic and real data demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2014.0

We begin by briefly reviewing the ACA's chief features and detailing its HIM provisions. Section two explores the policy history of exchanges, beginning with Clinton's proposals and Massachusetts' Connector and concluding by contrasting the House- passed bill with one national exchange and the Senate bill with state- based exchanges. Th e Senate bill became the ACA. Th e evolution of policy ideas about exchanges suggests three critical conditions for a successful exchange: commodification (of insurance products), competition (between insurers), and communication (to potential buyers and the public about insurance). Th e penultimate section compares the rollout of the state- run Kentucky exchange and the federally facilitated exchange in North Carolina in light of what we will call the 3 Cs.

2-s2.0-84893505117,"General Publications (Press, Editorials, Letters)","The objective of this article is to present a framework that couples cloud and high-performance computing for the parallel map projection of vector-based big spatial data. The past few years have witnessed a tremendous growth of a variety of high-volume spatial data-i.e., big spatial data. Map projection is often needed, for example, when we apply these big spatial data into large-scale spatial analysis and modeling approaches that require a common coordinate system. However, due to the size of these data and algorithmic complexity of map projections, the transformation of big spatial data between alternative projections represents a pressing computational challenge. Recent advancement in cloud computing and high-performance computing offers a potential means of addressing this computational challenge. The parallel map projection framework presented in this study is based on a layered architecture that couples capabilities of cloud computing and high-performance computing accelerated by Graphics Processing Units. We use large LiDAR data as an example of vector-based big spatial data to investigate the utility of the parallel map projection framework. As experimental results reveal, the framework provides considerable acceleration for re-projecting vector-based big spatial data. Coupling high-performance and cloud computing, which complement to each other, is a suggested solution for the efficient processing and analysis of big spatial data.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2014.0

2-s2.0-84893530010,Conference Paper,"Recent work showed the necessity of incorporating a user's background knowledge to improve the accuracy of estimates from noisy responses of histogram queries. Various types of constraints (e.g., linear constraints, ordering constraints, and range constraints) may hold on the true (non-randomized) answers of histogram queries. So the idea was to apply the constraints over the noisy responses and find a new set of answers (called refinements) that are closest to the noisy responses and also satisfy known constraints. As a result, the refinements expect to boost the accuracy of final histogram query results. However, there is one key question: is the ratio of the distributions of the results after refinements from any two neighbor databases still bounded? In this paper, we introduce a new definition, ρ-differential privacy on refinement, to quantify the change of distributions of refinements. We focus on one representative refinement, the linear refinement with linear constraints and study the relationship between the classic ε-differential privacy (on responses) and our ρ-differential privacy on refinement. We demonstrate the conditions when the ρ-differential privacy on refinement achieves the same ε-differential privacy. We argue privacy breaches could incur when the conditions do not meet.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2013.0
2-s2.0-84893543226,Conference Paper,"The power system state estimation is very important for maintaining the power system securely, reliably, and efficiently. An attacker can compromise meters or communication systems and introduce false measurements, which can evade existing bad data detection algorithms and lead to incorrect state estimation. This kind of stealthy attack is well-known as Undetected False Data Injection (UFDI) attack. However, attackers usually have different constraints with respect to knowledge, capabilities, resources, and attack targets. These attack attributes are important to consider in order to know the potential attack vectors. In this paper, we propose a formal model for UFDI attack verification in order to provide security analytics for power grid state estimation. Our model formalizes the grid information and different constraints, particularly with respect to attackers' point of view. The solution to the model provides an attack vector, when it exists, by satisfying the given constraints. We demonstrate our UFDI attack verification model with the help of an example. We evaluated our proposed model by running experiments on different IEEE test systems and we found that our model is very efficient in solving problems with hundreds of buses.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2013.0
2-s2.0-84893550786,Conference Paper,"In the current network protocol infrastructure, forwarding routes are mostly static except in case of failures or performance issues. However, static route selection offers a significant advantage for adversaries to eavesdrop, or launch DoS attacks on certain network flows. Previous works on multipath routing in wireless networks propose using random forwarding to avoid jamming and blackhole attacks [18]. However, this work is far from being practical for wired network because of many topological and QoS constraints. Moreover, the potential of finding a significant number of disjoint paths in wired networks is extremely low, which consequently decreases the value of RRM. In this paper we present a proactive Random Route Mutation (RRM) technique that enables changing randomly the route of the multiple flows in a network simultaneously to defend against reconnaissance, eavesdrop and DoS attacks, while preserving end-to-end QoS properties. Our contributions in this paper are three-fold: (1) modeling RRM as a constraint satisfaction problem using Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) to identify efficient practical route mutations, (2) proposing a new overlay placement technique that can maximize the effectiveness of RRM in visualized networks, and (3) developing analytical and experimental models to measure the effectiveness of RRM under different adversary models and network parameters. We develop a prototype RRM implementation in Software Defined Networks (SDNs). Our analysis, simulation and preliminary implementation show that RRM can protect at least 90% of the packet flow from being attacked against realistic attackers, as compared with static routes. Our evaluation study also shows that RRM can be efficiently deployed on both conventional networks and SDNs without causing any significant disruption for active flows.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2013.0
2-s2.0-84893578793,Conference Paper,"As a special type of stealth attacks, a rootkit hides its existence from malware detection and maintains continued privileged access to a computer system. The proliferation of virtualization creates a new technique for the detection of such attacks. In this paper, we propose to design a rootkit detection mechanism for virtual machines through deep information extracting and reconstruction at the hypervisor level. Through accessing the important components of a VM such as the kernel symbol table, the hypervisor can reconstruct the VM's execution states and learn the essential information such as the running processes, active network connections, and opened files. Through cross-verification among the different components of the reconstructed execution states of the VM, we can detect both the hidden information and the anomaly connections among them. We implement our approach in Xen 4.1 with Linux VMs. Our experiments show that the hypervisor can efficiently reconstruct the semantic view of a VM's memory and identify the rootkits. Since the hypervisor accesses only the high level data structures, it has very limited impacts on the performance of VM.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2013.0

2-s2.0-84893593185,Conference Paper,"Smart grids are capable of bi-directional communication between smart meters and headend systems. It is a core feature of smart grid provided by the underlying Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI). Due to the critical nature of AMI, threats have been targeted towards it and a need of tailored defense mechanism has been highlighted in the recent studies. Since limited number of protocols and applications are supported in the AMI, it exhibits a predictable and deterministic behavior. This predictability makes it easier for an attacker to learn the network behavior and launch an evasion attack by generating similar traffic. To combat this, we present a mutable AMI configuration technique for Proactive Defense. We randomize three different configuration parameters in order to make the AMI behavior unpredictable. While providing the randomization, the approach stays deterministic for the AMI devices like smart collector in order to detect any evasion attempts. We use real-world dataset comprising of approximately 2000 meters collected at an AMI of a leading utility provider for analysis.

The proposed metrics measure the risk of attacks on the network that is imposed due to weaknesses in the firewall policy. We also measure the feasibility of mitigating or removing that risk.

As a precaution against potential attacks, a remote machine can take a proactive counter-strategy to deceive fingerprinters. This is done by normalizing or mystifying the distinguishing behaviors in the packets. However, the unified modification causes significant performance degradation to benign clients. Using a game-theoretic approach, we propose a selective and dynamic mechanism for counter-fingerprinting. We first model and analyze the interaction between a fingerprinter and a target as a signaling game. We derive the Nash equilibrium strategy profiles based on the information gain analysis. Based on our game results, we design DeceiveGame, a mechanism to prevent or to significantly slow down fingerprinting attacks. Our game-theoretic approach appropriately distinguishes a fingerprinter from a benign client and mystifies packets to confuse the fingerprinter, while minimizing the side effects on benign clients. Our performance analysis shows that DeceiveGame can reduce the probability of success of the fingerprinter significantly, without deteriorating the overall performance of other clients.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2013.0
2-s2.0-84893600025,Conference Paper,"In this paper, we focus on differential privacy preserving spectral graph analysis. Spectral graph analysis deals with the analysis of the spectra (eigenvalues and eigenvector components) of the graph's adjacency matrix or its variants. We develop two approaches to computing the ε-differential eigen decomposition of the graph's adjacency matrix. The first approach, denoted as LNPP, is based on the Laplace Mechanism that calibrates Laplace noise on the eigenvalues and every entry of the eigenvectors based on their sensitivities. We derive the global sensitivities of both eigenvalues and eigenvectors based on the matrix perturbation theory. Because the output eigenvectors after perturbation are no longer orthogonormal, we postprocess the output eigenvectors by using the state-of-the-art vector orthogonalization technique. The second approach, denoted as SBMF, is based on the exponential mechanism and the properties of the matrix Bingham-von Mises-Fisher density for network data spectral analysis. We prove that the sampling procedure achieves differential privacy. We conduct empirical evaluation on a real social network data and compare the two approaches in terms of utility preservation (the accuracy of spectra and the accuracy of low rank approximation) under the same differential privacy threshold. Our empirical evaluation results show that LNPP generally incurs smaller utility loss.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2013.0
2-s2.0-84893611474,Conference Paper,"The ability to stay connected with friends online and share information, has accounted for the popularity of online social networking websites. However, the overwhelming task of access control policy management for information shared on these websites has resulted in various mental models of sharing with a false sense of privacy. The misalignment between a user's intended and actual privacy settings causes access control misconfigurations, raising the risk of unintentional privacy leaks. In this paper, we propose a scheme to extract the user's mental model of sharing, enhance this model using information learned from their existing policies, and enable them to compose misconfiguration free policies. We present the possible misconfiguration patterns based on which we scan the Facebook user's access control policies. We implemented a prototype Facebook application of our scheme and conducted a pilot study using Amazon Mechanical Turk. Our preliminary results show that the users' intended policies were significantly different than their actual policies. Our scheme was able to detect the misconfiguration patterns in album policies. However, the reduction in the number of misconfigurations after using our approach was not significant. Participants' perceptions of our proposed policy misconfiguration patterns and the usability of our scheme was positive.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2013.0
2-s2.0-84893627228,Article,"TopBP1, a multiple-BRCT-containing protein, plays diverse functions in DNA metabolism including DNA replication, DNA damage response and transcriptional regulation. The cytoplasmic localization of TopBP1 has been found to be associated with breast cancer susceptibility in clinical studies, suggesting the biological significance of TopBP1's sub-cellular localization. However, it remains elusive how TopBP1 is shuttled into nucleus and recruited to chromatin under normal or stressful conditions. Taking advantage of Xenopus egg extract, we identified Importin β as a new interacting protein of the TopBP1 C-terminus. We verified the TopBP1-Importin β association via GST pulldown and coimmunoprecipitation assays. We then demonstrated that TopBP1's C-terminal motif (designated as CTM, 23 amino acids) containing a putative NLS (nuclear localization signal) was required for Importin β interaction and that CT100 of Importin β (100 amino acids of extreme C-terminus of Importin β) was required for TopBP1 interaction. Further structure-function analysis reveals that the CTM of TopBP1 is essential for TopBP1's nuclear import and subsequent chromatin recruitment, thereby playing important roles in DNA replication and mitomycin C (MMC)-induced Chk1 phosphorylation. In addition, Importin β-specific inhibitor importazole inhibits TopBP1's nuclear import and the MMC-induced Chk1 phosphorylation. With ongoing DNA replication, the Importin β-dependent nuclear import of TopBP1 was indeed required for the MMC-induced Chk1 phosphorylation. Our data also suggest that checkpoint activation requires more TopBP1 than DNA replication does. The requirement of TopBP1's CTM motif for ATR-Chk1 checkpoint can be bypassed in a nucleus-free AT70 system. Taken together, our findings suggest that the CTM motif-mediated TopBP1 shuttling into nucleus via Importin β plays an important role in the ATR-Chk1 checkpoint signaling in Xenopus egg extracts.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2014.0
2-s2.0-84893630144,Conference Paper,"Smart grids provide bi-directional communication between smart meters at user premises and utility provider for the purpose of efficient energy management through Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI). Recent studies have shown that the potential threats targeting AMI are significant. Despite the need of developing intrusion detection systems (IDS) tailored for the smart grid [4], very limited progress has been made in this area so far. Unlike traditional networks, smart grid has its unique challenges, such as limited computational power devices and potentially high deployment cost, which restrict the deployment options of intrusion detectors. However, smart grid exhibits behavior that can be accurately modeled based on its configuration, which can be exploited to design efficient intrusion detectors. In this paper, we show that AMI behavior can be modeled using event logs collected at smart collectors, which in turn can be verified using the specifications invariant generated from the configurations of the AMI devices. We model the AMI behavior using the fourth order Markov chain and the stochastic model is then probabilistically verified using specifications written in Linear Temporal Logic. Our model is capable of detecting malicious behavior in the AMI network due to intrusions or device malfunctioning.

2-s2.0-84893690176,Article,"In this paper we investigate the problem of detecting small and subtle subgraphs embedded into a large graph with a common structure. We call the embedded small and subtle subgraphs as signals or anomalies and the large graph as background. Those small and subtle signals, which are structurally dissimilar to the background, are often hidden within graph communities and cannot be revealed in the graph's global structure. We explore the minor eigenvectors of the graph's adjacency matrix to detect subtle anomalies from a background graph. We demonstrate that when there are such subtle anomalies, there exist some minor eigenvectors with extreme values on some entries corresponding to the anomalies. Under the assumption of the Erdos-Renyi random graph model, we derive the formula that show how eigenvector entries are changed and give detectability conditions. We then extend our theoretical study to the general case where multiple anomalies are embedded in a background graph with community structure. We develop an algorithm that uses the eigenvector kurtosis to filter out the eigenvectors that capture the signals. Our theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations on both synthetic data and real social networks show effectiveness of our approach to detecting subtle signals.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2013.0

We define students' opportunity to learn within these states as a composite of three variables: time allocations for social studies (teacher reported instructional time), methods for teaching social studies (teacher reported instructional strategies), and content focus (teacher reported content emphases and state-mandated curriculum standards). Our guiding research question for this study was: To what extent do teachers' perceptions of elementary school social studies instructional practices and content vary between two states with different testing policies for social studies? Initial findings revealed notable differences that could not be explained by testing policies alone. Therefore, we conducted an exploratory content analysis of the elementary social studies curricula in these neighboring states. We uncovered curricular differences that suggest that state standards influence teachers' decisions in both what and how they choose to teach social studies. However, there were curriculum differences that did not align with S4 instructional methods and content focus output. Thus, we concluded that other factors apart from the curriculum guide teachers' decision-making. Results provided evidence that students have different opportunities to learn based on (1) state testing policies in social studies, (2) curriculum content, (3) how social studies is delivered (e.g., stand-alone versus integration), and (4) time allocated to social studies. We concluded that these variables constrict or expand students' opportunity to learn social studies and may influence teachers' pedagogical and content choices in elementary social studies.",Education,"Middle, Secondary, and K-12 Education",2014.0
2-s2.0-84893757388,Conference Paper,"A continuum manipulator, such as a multi-section trunk/tentacle robot, is promising for deft manipulation of a wide range of objects of different shapes and sizes. Given an object, a continuum manipulator tries to grasp it by wrapping tightly around it. Autonomous grasping requires realtime determination of whether an object can be grasped after it is identified, and if so, the feasible whole-arm wrapping around configurations of the robot to grasp it, which we call grasping configurations, as well as the path leading to a grasping configuration. In this paper, we describe the process for autonomous grasping from object detection to executing the grasping motion and achieving force-closure grasps, with a focus on a general analysis of all possible types of planar grasping configurations of a three-section continuum manipulator. We further provide conditions for existence of solutions and describe how to find a valid grasping configuration and the associated path automatically if one exists. Experimental results with the OctArm manipulator validate our approach, and shows that the entire process to determine an autonomous grasping operation, which includes automatic detection of the target object and determination of a grasping configuration and a path to the grasping configuration that avoids obstacles, can take just a small fraction of a second. Once a grasping configuration is reached, the manipulator can lift the object stably, i.e., a force-closure grasp can be achieved.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2013.0

The reason is that an organization's decision affects and is affected by the decision of its partners, particularly in the context of technology adoption and diffusion. Therefore, it is important to explore the role of this social network of organizations in shaping the process of technology diffusion. We conduct a series of experiments using the agent-based simulation modeling technique to identify strategically located firms in a network that can significantly influence the process of software diffusion. Our findings suggest that: 1) structural location of organizations does significantly influence the process of diffusion; and 2) the criteria for identifying strategically located firms depend on contextual factors, such as network topology, network density, and interoperability costs. To illustrate the practical use of these results, we propose a 'network-aware' pricing strategy that takes advantage of information regarding organizational social networks. We illustrate that contrary to prevalent practice in the enterprise software market, where firms are generally targeted on the basis of their size, network-aware pricing has the potential to facilitate the development of a more effective market penetration strategy.",Business,BISOM,2014.0

This study compared the haplotype structure and expression profile in skeletal muscle and brain of inherently high- (C57L/J) and low- (C3H/HeJ) active mice. Expression of nine candidate genes [Actn2, Actn3, Casq1, Drd2, Lepr, Mc4r, Mstn, Papss2, and Glut4 (a.k.a. Slc2a4)] was evaluated via RT-qPCR. SNPs were observed in regions of Actn2, Casq1, Drd2, Lepr, and Papss2; however, no SNPs were located in coding sequences or associated with any known regulatory sequences. In mice exposed to a running wheel, Casq1 (P=0.0003) and Mstn (P=0.002) transcript levels in the soleus were higher in the low-active mice. However, when these genes were evaluated in naïve animals, differential expression was not observed, demonstrating a training effect. Among naïve mice, no genes in either tissue exhibited differential expression between strains.

We quantify and qualify the pretest probability, outcomes, and radiation exposure of adults with both chest pain and dyspnea. Methods: This was a prospective, 4-center, outcomes study. Patients were adults with dyspnea and chest pain, nondiagnostic ECGs, and no obvious diagnosis. Pretest probability for both acute coronary syndrome and pulmonary embolism was assessed with a validated method; ultralow risk was defined as pretest probability less than 2.5% for both acute coronary syndrome and pulmonary embolism. Patients were followed for diagnosis and total medical radiation exposure for 90 days. Results: Eight hundred forty patients had complete data; 23 (3%) had acute coronary syndrome and 15 (2%) had pulmonary embolism. The cohort received an average of 4.9 mSv radiation to the chest, 48% from computed tomography pulmonary angiography. The pretest probability estimates for acute coronary syndrome and pulmonary embolism were less than 2.5% in 227 patients (27%), of whom 0 of 277 (0%; 95% confidence interval 0% to 1.7%) had acute coronary syndrome or pulmonary embolism and 7 of 227 (3%) had any significant cardiopulmonary diagnosis.

Samples were analyzed for inflammation (interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8; tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα); monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1)), oxidative stress (oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP), reduced and oxidized glutathione, protein carbonyls), and innate immune function (granulocyte (G-PHAG) and monocyte (M-PHAG) phagocytosis and oxidative burst activity). A 2 (group) × 4 (time points) repeated measures ANOVA revealed significant time effects due to 3 days of exercise for IL-6 (396% increase), IL-8 (78% increase), TNFα (12% increase), MCP-1 (30% increase), G-PHAG (38% increase), M-PHAG (36% increase), FRAP (12.6% increase), ORAC (11% decrease at 14 h post exercise), and protein carbonyls (82% increase at 14 h post exercise) (p &lt; 0.01).

For this problem, we consider two variants, connectivity preserving minimum node cut (CPMNC) and connectivity preserving minimum edge cut (CPMEC). For CPMNC, we show that it cannot be approximated within α logn for some constant α unless P=NP, and cannot be approximated within any poly(logn) unless NP has quasi-polynomial time algorithms.

Using parametric survival analysis, we test the effects of regional innovation on exit likelihood in the US computer and electronic product manufacturing during the 1992-2008 period. The novelty of our approach is in conditioning the effects of metropolitan innovation on firm size. Estimation results suggest a negative relationship between metropolitan patenting activity and survival of firms that started with 1-3 employees. This effect decreases if companies grow. Establishments with more than 4 employees at start-up are insensitive to metropolitan innovation, although size of firms that started with 4-9 employees improves their survival chances. These findings indicate that local knowledge spillovers do not translate into lower hazard. The negative relationship indicates either a creative destruction regime or decisions of entrepreneurs to shut down existing ventures in order to pursue other opportunities.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2014.0
2-s2.0-84894097432,Article,"The purpose of this chapter is to describe the vocabulary development and promising, evidence-based vocabulary interventions for English learners (ELs) from preschool through second grade. To achieve this purpose, we have taken six steps. First, we describe the elements of language development in the native language (L1) and a second language (L2) and how these elements relate to three phases of reading development (i.e., the prereading phase, the learning to read phase, and the reading to learn phase). We contend that in order for ELs to succeed in school, they need a strong language foundation prior to entering kindergarten. This language foundation needs to continue developing during the ""learning to read"" and ""reading to learn"" phases. Second, we describe the limitations of current practice in preschool for ELs related to vocabulary instruction and to family involvement to support children's language development. Third, we report curricular challenges faced by ELs in early elementary school, and we relate these challenges to the increase in reading and language demands outlined in the Common Core State Standards (CCSS). Specific language activities that can help meet some of the demands are provided in a table. Fourth, we synthesize the research on evidence-based vocabulary instruction and intervention and discuss implications for practice with ELs. Fifth, we describe two intervention projects under development that have the potential to improve EL vocabulary and language proficiency in the early grades.

The first method, called pre-KEM seeding, can be applied to a large class of KEM/DEM constructions including those based on the discrete logarithm problem. The second method, called post-KEM converging, is more powerful and can be employed to convert any secure KEM/DEM into a secure PKE-SR. Post-KEM converging takes advantages of an interesting property, called collision accessibility, of sibling intractable hashing. For both methods, added costs in ciphertext length and computation are minimal, making them a particularly attractive ""drop-in"" replacement in applications where plaintexts need to be recovered efficiently by the sender alone.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2013.0
2-s2.0-84894153159,"General Publications (Press, Editorials, Letters)","Lateral ankle sprains (LASs) are among the most common sports-related injuries and a high percentage of individuals who sprain their ankle go on to develop chronic ankle instability (CAI). The condition of CAI is often classified as having pain, loss of function, and a restriction of, or failure to, return to levels of previous activity. Historically, uninjured healthy controls are used as a comparison group to study the biomechanical and neuromuscular consequences of CAI. However, this model is not ideal to determine why a portion of the population experiencing an ankle sprain does not recover. A more appropriate comparison may be individuals who had an ankle sprain, and thus the exposure, but did not go on to develop CAI (i.e., copers). Thus, the purpose of this review was to determine the existing discrepancies and common standards in definitions of, terminology used for, and the inclusionary/ exclusionary criteria used to describe copers within the CAI literature. Multiple databases were searched by keywords and specific authors. Potential studies were screened independently by both authors. Inclusion criteria consisted of an explicit definition of copers and explicit inclusionary/ exclusionary criteria. A total of 21 studies were included in the current study and had four outcomes extracted: (1) the definition of copers; (2) the terminology used; (3) specific inclusionary/exclusionary criteria; and (4) injury characteristics of the copers. Based on the included operational definitions, it is recommend that future operational definitions of copers include three key components: (1) an initial LAS; (2) subsequent lack of CAI symptoms (i.e., no complaints of disability or giving way); and (3) a time since injury component. The term coper was overwhelming used within the existing literature (n = 15) and is thus recommended to be used in future studies when describing individuals who have suffered an LAS but failed to develop CAI. Minimal inclusionary criteria should consist of three things: (1) an initial LAS severe enough to warrant either the use of a protective device (e.g., ankle brace) for at least 1 week or immobilization and/or non-weight bearing for at least 3 days, or both; (2) a return to at least moderate levels of weight-bearing physical activity for at least 12 months without recurrent injury, episodes of giving way, and/or feelings of instability; and (3) minimal, if any, level of self-reported disability. Acute head and/or lower extremity injuries that occurred ≤3 months prior to testing, a history of ankle fractures and/or surgeries, and the presence of pain (constant or intermittent) should be used as minimal exclusionary criteria in future investigations dealing with copers. Finally, at least seven items should be reported to better contextualize copers across investigations. These items should include the initial mechanism of injury, the presence of mechanical laxity, number of days immobilized and/or non-weight bearing after the initial ankle sprain, time since the latest ankle sprain, percentage of coper participants with a recurrent ankle sprain or giving way episode, current physical activity levels, and whether copers attended formal rehabilitation for their involved ankle.",CHHS,Kinesiology,2014.0

That is, employee humor climate provides an identifiable way in which employees interpret ambiguous events to make meaning of their organizations and their place within it. We develop a model in which role ambiguity and perceived organizational support (POS) interact to affect positive and negative humor climate at work. Further, we propose that managerial support for humor mediates the relationship between POS and employees' positive and negative humor climate. Finally, we hypothesize that as a way of making sense of the organization, humor climate should be related to organizational identification. We collected data on 373 full-time employees in a variety of organizations. Using SEM, the results generally support our model.

The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that genetic background contributes to the development of a PCOS-like reproductive and metabolic phenotype in mice exposed to excess DHEA during the pubertal transition. We tested whether the PCOS phenotype would be more pronounced on the diabetes-prone C57BL/6 background than the previously used strain, BALB/cByJ. In addition, we examined strain-dependent upregulation of the expression of ovarian and extra-ovarian candidate genes implicated in human PCOS, genes containing known strain variants, and genes involved with steroidogenesis or insulin sensitivity. These studies show that there are significant strain-related differences in metabolic response to excess androgen exposure during puberty.

This journal issue grew out of an April 2011 conference in her memory, held at the National Humanities Center, on ""Jewish emigres and the Shaping of Postwar Culture."" The nexus between her innovative intellectual contributions and her experience as a Jewish émigré reflects one of the conference's central concerns: How, why, and in what fashion did the émigrés' dislocations shape innovative intellectual paths and cosmopolitan visions of Europe and European culture. Born in Austria and educated in England, Furst pursued an intellectual career in the United States, hoping it would allow her to break out of narrow national boundaries. The excerpt of her memoir here illuminates how her life's work as a pioneer in the field of comparative literary studies grew out of her experience with language as a German-speaking refugee in wartime England. Her memoir written in the third person about ""Rachel"" also reflects her dual identity as Jew and European.

2-s2.0-84894385656,Article,"Purpose: Sparing of single-side parotid gland is a common practice in head-and-neck (HN) intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) planning. It is a special case of dose sparing tradeoff between different organs-at-risk. The authors describe an improved mathematical model for predicting achievable dose sparing in parotid glands in HN IMRT planning that incorporates single-side sparing considerations based on patient anatomy and learning from prior plan data. Methods: Among 68 HN cases analyzed retrospectively, 35 cases had physician prescribed single-side parotid sparing preferences. The single-side sparing model was trained with cases which had single-side sparing preferences, while the standard model was trained with the remainder of cases. A receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis was performed to determine the best criterion that separates the two case groups using the physician's single-side sparing prescription as ground truth. The final predictive model (combined model) takes into account the single-side sparing by switching between the standard and single-side sparing models according to the single-side sparing criterion. The models were tested with 20 additional cases. The significance of the improvement of prediction accuracy by the combined model over the standard model was evaluated using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Results: Using the ROC analysis, the best single-side sparing criterion is (1) the predicted median dose of one parotid is higher than 24 Gy; and (2) that of the other is higher than 7 Gy. This criterion gives a true positive rate of 0.82 and a false positive rate of 0.19, respectively. For the bilateral sparing cases, the combined and the standard models performed equally well, with the median of the prediction errors for parotid median dose being 0.34 Gy by both models (p = 0.81). For the single-side sparing cases, the standard model overestimates the median dose by 7.8 Gy on average, while the predictions by the combined model differ from actual values by only 2.2 Gy (p = 0.005). Similarly, the sum of residues between the modeled and the actual plan DVHs is the same for the bilateral sparing cases by both models (p = 0.67), while the standard model predicts significantly higher DVHs than the combined model for the single-side sparing cases (p = 0.01). Conclusions: The combined model for predicting parotid sparing that takes into account single-side sparing improves the prediction accuracy over the previous model.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2014.0

Many of these products contain compounds similar to those within cannabis and function to create a high comparable to that of smoking marijuana. Though governments have regulated these psychoactive compounds, variants are still sold. At this point, little is known about the characteristics of users of synthetic cannabinoids. Design and Participants: A self-report survey instrument was administered to 2349 university students at a large institute in the State of Georgia. Respondents reported on their lifetime, last-year, and last-month synthetic cannabinoid use and demographic characteristics. Results: Males, Whites and Hispanics, users of other substances, and those from more affluent families were significantly more likely to report having used a synthetic cannabinoid. In addition, those that self-identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT) were twice as likely to have used synthetic cannabinoids.

AAC was present in 68.3 % of the men. Greater cortical, but not trabecular, vBMD was associated with significantly decreased odds of AAC independent of traditional risk factors. Introduction: The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence and correlates of AAC in a sample of 278 Afro-Caribbean men (mean age 56) and to test for a largely unexplored association between cortical and trabecular vBMD with AAC prevalence. Methods: Men were recruited consecutively as part of an ongoing prospective cohort study of body composition in men aged 40+. For this analysis, AAC was assessed by computed tomography of the abdomen from L3 to S1. Aortic calcium was scored using the Agatston method, and prevalence was defined as a score ≥10 to rule out false positives. Men also had BMD assessed using peripheral quantitative computed tomography at 4 % (trabecular vBMD) and 33 % (cortical vBMD) of the radius and tibia. Results: Abdominal aortic calcification was present in 68.3 % of the men. Significant independent predictors of AAC prevalence were increased age, increased BMI, hypertension, and current smoking. Age was the strongest predictor, with each SD (7.8 year) increase in age conferring 2.7 times increased odds of having AAC (P < 0.0001). A one SD greater cortical, but not trabecular, vBMD was associated with a significant decreased odds of AAC prevalence independent of other traditional risk factors (OR 0.65; 95 % CI 0.45-0.92). Conclusions: Cortical vBMD is inversely associated with AAC presence.

Participants were randomised to Portobello mushroom powder (600 IU/d vitamin D2) or placebo for 6 weeks. Participants then completed a 1.5-h exercise session designed to induce skeletal muscle damage. Blood samples and measures of skeletal muscle function were taken pre-supplementation, post-supplementation/pre-exercise and post-exercise. Six weeks supplementation with vitamin D2 increased serum 25(OH)D2 by 9.9-fold and decreased serum 25(OH)D3 by 28%. Changes in skeletal muscle function and circulating markers of skeletal muscle damage did not differ between groups.

Jiang1 proposed a concept named flow intensity to measure the intensity with which the monitoring data reacts to the volume of different user requests. The Autoregressive model with exogenous inputs (ARX) was used to quantify the relationship between each pair of flow intensity measured at various points across distributed systems. If such relationships hold all the time, they are considered as invariants of the underlying systems. Such invariants have been successfully used to characterize complex systems and support various system management tasks, such as system fault detection and localization. However, it is very time-consuming to search the complete set of invariants of large scale systems and existing algorithms are not scalable for thousands of flow intensity measurements. To this end, in this paper, we develop effective pruning techniques based on the identified upper bounds. Accordingly, two efficient algorithms are proposed to search the complete set of invariants based on the pruning techniques. Finally we demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithms with both real-world and synthetic data sets.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2013.0

These limitations were addressed by using classification tree analysis separately for black patients and white patients to identify characteristics that segment patients who have increased risks for a venous catheter-related bloodstream infection. Methods: A retrospective, cross-sectional analysis of 5,236,045 discharges from 103 Florida acute hospitals in 2005-2009 was conducted. Hospitals were rank ordered on the basis of the black/white Patient Safety Indicator (PSI) 7 rate ratio as follows: Group 1 (white rate higher), Group 2, (equivalent rates), Group 3, (black rate higher), and Group 4, (black rate highest). Predictor variables included 26 comorbidities (Elixhauser Comorbidity Index) and demographic characteristics. Four separate classification tree analyses were completed for each race/hospital group. Results: Individual characteristics and groups of characteristics associated with increased PSI 7 risk differed for black and white patients. The average age for both races was different across the hospital groups (p < .01). Weight loss was the strongest single delineator and common to both races. The black subgroups with the highest PSI 7 risk were Medicare beneficiaries who were either < 25.5 years without hypertension or < 39.5 years without hypertension but with an emergency or trauma admission. The white subgroup with the highest PSI 7 risk consisted of patients < 45.5 years who had congestive heart failure but did not have either hypertension or weight loss. Discussion: Identifying subgroups of patients at risk for a rare safety event such as PSI 7 should aid effective clinical decisions and efficient use of resources and help to guide patient safety interventions.",CHHS,Public Health,2014.0

Some scholars consider effective human resource management (HRM) the single most important factor affecting organizational performance. This study examined (1) the extent to which HRM strategies were included in organizational strategic planning and (2) the association between the involvement of senior HR professionals in strategic planning and the use of innovative HR practices in U.S. hospitals employing strategic HRM theory. A survey was administered to 168 chief executive officers and HR executives from 85 hospitals during spring 2005. Binary logistic regression was conducted to determine whether HRM involvement was associated with the use of innovative HRM strategies in the hospitals. We found significant associations between HRM strategy inclusion in the strategic planning process and senior HR professionals' involvement in organizational strategic planning and in three innovative HR activities: finding talent in advance for key job openings (odds ratio [OR] = 4.61, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.10-7.38), stressing organizational culture and values in the selection process (OR = 3.97, 95% CI: 1.01-3.97), and basing individual or team compensation on goal-oriented results (OR = 6.17, 95% CI: 1.17-3.37). Our data indicate that innovative HR practices were underused in some U.S. hospitals despite their potential to improve overall hospital performance.

Using a comprehensive, multiyear database of patent applications, we investigate whether the knowledge creation network profiles are discriminating characteristics of metropolitan regions by establishing a new urban taxonomy for metropolitan areas in the United States. The four-class taxonomy is not only statistically significant, but it is also economically meaningful in terms of economic performance of metropolitan areas. We find that metropolitan areas benefit from a higher density of inventors in the population, and that there is a positive correlation between economic performance and metropolitan areas with inventor teams working in similar or complementary areas of technology.

Specifically, this paper examines the relationship between a woman's age and her use and knowledge of medicinal plants. It also examines whether length of residence in three different areas of the Amazon is correlated with a woman's use and knowledge of medicinal plants. Two of the areas where respondents may have resided, the jungle/seringal and farms/colonias, are classified as rural. The third area (which all of the respondents resided in) was urban.Methods: This paper utilizes survey data collected in Rio Branco, Brazil. Researchers administered the survey to 153 households in the community of Bairro da Luz (a pseudonym). The survey collected data on phytotherapeutic knowledge, general phytotherapeutic practice, recent phytotherapeutic practice and demographic information on age and length of residence in the seringal, on a colonia, and in a city. Bivariate correlation coefficients were calculated to assess the inter-relationships among the key variables. Three dependent variables, two measuring general phytotherapeutic practice and one measuring phytotherapeutic knowledge were regressed on the demographic factors.Results: The results demonstrate a relationship between a woman's age and medicinal plant use, but not between age and plant knowledge. Additionally, length of residence in an urban area and on a colonia/farm are not related to medicinal plant knowledge or use. However, length of residence in the seringal/jungle is positively correlated with both medicinal plant knowledge and use.Conclusions: The results reveal a vibrant tradition of medicinal plant use in Bairro da Luz. They also indicate that when it comes to place of residence and phytotherapy the meaningful distinction is not rural versus urban, it is seringal versus other locations. Finally, the results suggest that phytotherapeutic knowledge and use should be measured separately since one may not be an accurate proxy for the other.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Anthropology,2014.0

We have previously demonstrated the ability of microglia and astrocytes to respond to bacterial pathogens or their products by rapid production of inflammatory mediators, followed by the production of the immunosuppressive cytokine interleukin (IL)-10. IL-19, another member of the IL-10 family of cytokines, has been studied in the context of a number of inflammatory conditions in the periphery and is known to modulate immune cell activity. In the present study, we demonstrate the constitutive and/or inducible expression of IL-19 and its cognate receptor subunits, IL-19Rα and IL-19Rβ (also known as IL-20R1 and IL-20R2, and IL-20RA and IL-20RB), in mouse brain tissue, and by primary murine and human astrocytes. We also provide evidence for the presence of a novel truncated IL-19Rα transcript variant in mouse brain tissue, but not glial cells, that shows reduced expression following bacterial infection. Importantly, IL-19R functionality in glia is indicated by the ability of IL-19 to regulate signaling component expression in these cells. Furthermore, while IL-19 itself had no effect on glial cytokine production, IL-19 treatment of bacterially infected or Toll-like receptor ligand stimulated astrocytes significantly attenuated pro-inflammatory cytokine production. The bacterially induced production of IL-19 by these resident CNS cells, the constitutive expression of its cognate receptor subunits, and the immunomodulatory effects of this cytokine, suggest a novel mechanism by which astrocytes can regulate CNS inflammation.",CHHS,Kinesiology,2014.0

Relationships among the primary species known as 'blueberry' has been a source of speculation due to the out-breeding nature of the crop, the use of intra-specific hybridization and open-pollinated selection in breeding programs, and the lack of genomic resources to adequately address the issue. The objectives of this study were to characterize simple sequence repeats (SSRs) from an emerging genomic draft sequence, develop useful molecular markers and provide an in-depth analysis of genetic diversity and population structure in blueberry using a broad range of cultivated blueberry accessions representing multiple species, ploidy levels and sources of origin. Genomic scaffolding was assembled from the whole-genome sequencing of a diploid V. corymbosum accession 'W8520.' From the assembled 358 Mb sequence, a total number of 43,594 SSRs were identified (122 per Mb). Among genomic regions, SSRs were longest and occurred most frequently in predicted 5′ untranslated regions (5′ UTR), while SSRs were shortest and least common in the predicted coding sequences. AG/CT and AAG/CTT were the most frequent motifs while CG/CG and CCG/CGG motifs were the rarest di- and trinucleotide motifs, respectively.

It has been assumed that measures of regional patenting activity or human capital are an adequate way to capture the endogenous creation of new ideas that result in productivity improvements. This process has been conceived as occurring in two stages. First, an invention or innovation is generated, and then it is developed and commercialized to create benefits for the individual or firm owning the idea. Typically these steps are combined into a single model of the ""invention in/productivity out"" variety. Using data on Gross Metropolitan Product per worker and on inventors, educational attainment, and creative workers (together with other important socioeconomic controls), we unpack the model back to the two-step process and use a SEM modeling framework to investigate the relationships among inventive activity and potential inventors, regional technology levels, and regional productivity outcomes.

Clearly, the simplification of the ""invention in/productivity out"" model does not hold, which supports other work that questions the use of patents and patenting related measures as meaningful innovation inputs to processes that generate regional productivity and productivity gains. We also find that the most effective measure of regional inventive capacity, in terms of its effect on technology, productivity, and productivity growth is the share of the workforce engaged in creative activities.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2014.0

Previous approaches usually depend on individual or combined received signal strength (RSS) measurements to detect emulators. In this paper, we propose a new mechanism based on physical layer network coding to detect the emulators. When two signal sequences interfere at the receiver, the starting point of collision is determined by the distances among the receiver and the senders. Using the signal interference results at multiple receivers and the positions of reference senders, we can determine the position of the 'claimed' primary user. We can then compare this localization result with the known position of the primary user to detect the PUE attack. We design a PUE detection mechanism for wireless networks with trustworthy reference senders. We analyze the overhead of the proposed approach and study its detection accuracy through simulation.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2013.0

Data Sources. National Association of County and City Health Officials' 2008 National Profile of Local Health Departments survey was linked to the Association of State and Territorial Health Official's 2007 Profile of State Public Health Survey. Study Design. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of organizational factors associated with gaps in data sharing between state health agencies (SHAs) and local health departments (LHDs) in the areas of childhood immunizations, vital records, and reportable conditions. Data Collection. Based on reported information system (IS) capabilities, we created a binary variable that measured whether bidirectional data sharing was structurally possible between an LHD and its respective SHA. Principal Findings. The proportion of LHDs experiencing a data sharing gap was 34.0 percent for immunizations, 69.8 percent for vital records, and 81.8 percent for reportable conditions. Increased SHA technological capacity and size reduced the odds of gaps. Conclusions. Improving the IS capabilities of public health agencies may be the key to their remaining relevant in the currently evolving health care system.",CHHS,Public Health,2014.0

We hypothesize that quantitative pretest probability, linked to evidence-based management strategies, can reduce unnecessary radiation exposure and cost in low-risk patients with symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome and pulmonary embolism. Methods and Results-This was a prospective, 4-center, randomized controlled trial of decision support effectiveness. Subjects were adults with chest pain and dyspnea, nondiagnostic ECGs, and no obvious diagnosis. The clinician provided data needed to compute pretest probabilities from a Web-based system. Clinicians randomized to the intervention group received the pretest probability estimates for both acute coronary syndrome and pulmonary embolism and suggested clinical actions designed to lower radiation exposure and cost. The control group received nothing. Patients were followed for 90 days. The primary outcome and sample size of 550 was predicated on a significant reduction in the proportion of healthy patients exposed to >5 mSv chest radiation. A total of 550 patients were randomized, and 541 had complete data. The proportion with >5 mSv to the chest and no significant cardiopulmonary diagnosis within 90 days was reduced from 33% to 25% (P=0.038). The intervention group had significantly lower median chest radiation exposure (0.06 versus 0.34 mSv; P=0.037, Mann-Whitney U test) and lower median costs ($934 versus $1275; P=0.018) for medical care. Adverse events occurred in 16% of controls and 11% in the intervention group (P=0.06).

This article reports findings of modified participant observation and qualitative research conducted from 2008 to 2010 with women incarcerated in a large, county jail in North Carolina addressing these issues. Thirty life history interviews, nine focus groups, and 60 questionnaires reveal the centrality of trauma, particularly in the form of interpersonal violence (i.e., sexual, physical, and/or emotional abuse in adulthood and/or childhood), in incarcerated women's lives. In the absence of positive resources (e.g., counseling, family/friend support), women's attempts to cope with trauma increase their risks for incarceration as well as further trauma.

Based on a sample of 102 students, results show that ability influences exam performance both directly and indirectly via pre-exam emotions. Also, ability and distraction interact to influence performance such that ability has a buffering effect. Distraction has a significant deleterious effect on performance for low ability students, but does not disrupt performance for high ability students. Moreover, positive emotions facilitate performance by decreasing distraction whereas negative emotions hinder performance by increasing it. Finally, results show that the exam itself has a significant impact on post-exam positive and negative emotions, even when controlling for pre-exam emotions.

Since the establishment of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) of 1975, there has been growing interest in understanding the relationship between African American male students and special education assessment. In this research we explore the impact that the historic denial of educational equality and culturally responsive pedagogy has had on the disproportionately high placement of African American males in special education programs for the mentally disabled, and behaviorally and emotionally challenged. Our research reveals three primary catalysts for special education placement of African American male students: 1) persistent patterns of discrimination, 2) biases in assessments, and 3) social differences in students' behaviors and learning styles. The findings further reveal that the integration of culturally responsive and reflective arts education into teacher pedagogy and curriculum helps to mediate school disengagement, and addresses the multiple intelligences and learning styles of African Americans. This research has important implications for teacher education programs, as it increases awareness and provides strategies and techniques for arts integration that may lead to higher levels of cognitive development and academic achievement in African Americans and the broader student population.",Education,"Middle, Secondary, and K-12 Education",2011.0

There have been a number of studies of high speed rail in China. However, detailed spatiotemporal accessibility pattern of cities affected by the operation of high speed rail in China has not been reported. This study takes a timetable-based accessibility evaluation approach to analyze the changes in travel time, travel cost, and distance accessibility for each of the four main stages of HSR development in China: no HSR service in Stage 1 before August 2008, several HSR lines in Stage 2 between August 2008 and July 2011, reduced operating speed of HSR trains in Stage 3 between August 2011 and November 2012, and addition of new HSR lines and reduction of ticket fares in Stage 4 between December 2012 and January 2013. In addition to the ""corridor effect"" and the ""center-diffusion"" pattern, this paper investigates the impacts of HSR on changes in in-vehicle travel time and out-of-vehicle travel time with respect to the policy changes that reduced the operating speed of HSR trains, rearranged the train timetable, and lowered the ticket fare on HSR trains. The analysis results indicate the spatiotemporal pattern of Chinese cities affected by these policy changes.

In this paper, we present a joint dictionary learning (JDL) algorithm which exploits the inter-category visual correlations to learn more discriminative dictionaries. Given a group of visually correlated categories, JDL simultaneously learns one common dictionary and multiple category-specific dictionaries to explicitly separate the shared visual atoms from the category-specific ones. The problem of JDL is formulated as a joint optimization with a discrimination promotion term according to the Fisher discrimination criterion. A visual tree method is developed to cluster a large number of categories into a set of disjoint groups, so that each of them contains a reasonable number of visually correlated categories. The process of image category clustering helps JDL to learn better dictionaries for classification by ensuring that the categories in the same group are of strong visual correlations. Also, it makes JDL to be computationally affordable in large-scale applications. Three classification schemes are adopted to make full use of the dictionaries learned by JDL for visual content representation in the task of image categorization. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms has been evaluated using two image databases containing 17 and 1,000 categories, respectively.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2014.0

Based on the given legitimation values of their discipline, agents are attracted towards knowers or knowledge. The force of attraction towards the knower or knowledge varies across disciplines. The emergent design practice is plotted in a two dimensional space defined by the knower and knowledge axes. The effect of scale is studied by changing the number of agents. The effect of value is studied by comparing scenarios where legitimation values of a design agent remain constant throughout the simulations to scenarios where legitimation values increase at a constant rate, as a function of time spent in a multi-disciplinary environment. Preliminary results indicate that both scaling up and changing values can lead to cohesive design practice in multi-disciplinary societies.

Most existing routing methods for MONs avoid the costly flooding by selecting one or multiple relays to deliver data during each encounter. How to pick the ""good"" relay from all encounters is a non-trivial task. To achieve efficient delivery of messages at low costs, in this paper, we propose a novel group-based routing protocol in which the relay node is selected based on multi-level cross-community social group information. We apply a simple group formation method to both historical encounters (social relationships in physical world) and/or social profiles of mobile users (social relationships in social world) and build multi-level cross-community social groups, which summarize the wide range of social relationships among all mobile participants.

Keeping track of data provenance in such highly dynamic context is an important requirement, since data provenance is a key factor in assessing data trustworthiness which is crucial for many applications. Provenance management for streaming data requires addressing several challenges, including the assurance of high processing throughput, low bandwidth consumption, storage efficiency and secure transmission. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to securely transmit provenance for streaming data (focusing on sensor network) by embedding provenance into the interpacket timing domain while addressing the above mentioned issues. As provenance is hidden in another host-medium, our solution can be conceptualized as watermarking technique. However, unlike traditional watermarking approaches, we embed provenance over the interpacket delays (IPDs) rather than in the sensor data themselves, hence avoiding the problem of data degradation due to watermarking. Provenance is extracted by the data receiver utilizing an optimal threshold-based mechanism which minimizes the probability of provenance decoding errors. The resiliency of the scheme against outside and inside attackers is established through an extensive security analysis. Experiments show that our technique can recover provenance up to a certain level against perturbations to inter-packet timing characteristics.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2013.0

Routing in such mobile social DTNs is very challenging as it must handle network partitioning, long delays, and dynamic topology. Recently, social-based approaches, which attempt to exploit social behaviors of DTN nodes to make better routing decision, have drawn tremendous interests in DTN routing design. In this paper, we propose a novel social-based routing approach for mobile social DTNs, where a new metric social energy is introduced to quantify the ability of a node to forward packets to others, inspired by general laws in particle physics. Social energy is generated via node encounters and shared by the communities of encountering nodes. Similar to the radiation of energy in physics, the social energy of any node decays over time. Our proposed Social Energy Based Routing (SEBAR) protocol considers social energy of encountering nodes and is in favor of the Dode with a higher social energy in its or the destination's social community.

No study has examined the economic and operational impact of BMI in patients with chest complaints presenting to the emergency department (ED). The objective was to measure the association of BMI with the main outcomes of cost of care, length of stay (including time in the ED and time in the wards if admitted), and radiation exposure in patients presenting to the ED with chest pain and dyspnea. Methods and Results-This was a prospective, 4-center, outcomes study. Patients were adults with dyspnea and chest pain, nondiagnostic electrocardiograms, and no obvious diagnosis. Patients were followed for the main outcomes for90 days. Outcomes that were stratified by BMI in 5 categories, underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese, and morbidly obese, were compared using the Kruskall-Wallis rank test, and the independent predictive value of BMI was tested with multivariate regressions. Compared with medical costs for normalweight patients, costs were 22% higher for overweight patients (P=0.077), 28% higher for obese patients (P=0.020), and 41% higher for morbidly obese patients (P=0.015). Morbidly obese patients without computerized tomographic scanning stayed in the hospital 34% longer than normal weight patients (P=0.073), and morbidly obese patients with computerized tomographic scanning stayed in the hospital 44% longer than normal weight patients (P=0.083). BMI was not a significant predictor of radiation exposure. Morbidly obese patients had the highest proportion (87%) of no significant cardiopulmonary diagnosis for 90 days after computerized tomographic pulmonary angiography.

2-s2.0-84897995944,Article,"Testing database applications typically requires the generation of tests consisting of both program inputs and database states. Recently, a testing technique called Dynamic Symbolic Execution (DSE) has been proposed to reduce manual effort in test generation for software applications. However, applying DSE to generate tests for database applications faces various technical challenges. For example, the database application under test needs to physically connect to the associated database, which may not be available for various reasons. The program inputs whose values are used to form the executed queries are not treated symbolically, posing difficulties for generating valid database states or appropriate database states for achieving high coverage of query-result-manipulation code. To address these challenges, in this article, we propose an approach called SynDB that synthesizes new database interactions to replace the original ones from the database application under test. In this way, we bridge various constraints within a database application: query-construction constraints, query constraints, database schema constraints, and query-result-manipulation constraints.We then apply a state-of-the-art DSE engine called Pex for .NET from Microsoft Research to generate both program inputs and database states. The evaluation results show that tests generated by our approach can achieve higher code coverage than existing test generation approaches for database applications.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2014.0
2-s2.0-84898005704,Article,"The historical, material, and spatial processes that defined the formative settlement practices in Early Osogbo (southwest Nigeria), a seventeenth- to early eighteenth-century frontier community, is the subject of this article. I use different datasets, including the spatial layout of the site, the archaeological depositional sequence, diverse artifact categories, and oral historical sources to engage Igor Kopytoff's Internal African Frontier thesis. In this article, I argue against Kopytoff's conceptualization of the frontier as a conservative space that relied on innovations from the metropolis. Instead, I demonstrate that Early Osogbo was a dynamic formative settlement in an internal Yoruba regional frontier whose material life was not a mere copy of a metropolis's. Instead, this emerging community was characterized by diversity, complexity, experimentation, and newness that resulted from local forces of migration, frontier social networks, and regional exchange systems involving several spheres of interstitial frontiers and multiple metropolises. Contrary to the metropolis-frontier pattern of migration that informed Kopytoff's Internal African Frontier thesis, Early Osogbo was originally created by frontier-frontier migrations before it became a site for intermetropolis contestation. The article underscores the need to bring conceptual clarity to the study of frontier processes, arguing that different historical contexts, migration patterns, and regional political frameworks produced different kinds of frontiers such as crossroads, boundary, colony, and cultural frontiers. The archaeological profile of Early Osogbo demonstrates that the settlement was a crossroads frontier community.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Africana Studies,2014.0

J Strength Cond Res 28(2): 443-451, 2014-Active-video gaming is purported to produce similar cardiovascular responses as aerobic fitness activities. This study compared the emotional and cardiovascular effects of Wii games with those of traditional exercise in college-aged adults with different exercise backgrounds. Specifically, the percentage of heart rate reserve, rate of perceived exertion (RPE), level of enjoyment, and Positive and Negative Affect Schedule scores were compared between subjects who reported exercising frequently at high intensities (high-intensity exerciser group: age = 20.18 years [0.87]; Height = 165.23 cm [9.97]; Mass = 62.37 kg [11.61]), N = 11 and those who exercise more often at lower intensities (low-intensity exercisers group: age = 20.72 years [1.19]; Height = 164.39 cm [8.05]; Mass = 68.04 kg [10.71]), N = 11. The subjects completed six 20-minute exercises sessions: treadmill walking, stationary cycling, and Wii's Tennis, Boxing, Cycling, and Step. The low-intensity exerciser group achieved a greater percentage of heart rate reserve (a) during traditional exercise compared with that during Wii boxing, (b) playing Wii boxing compared with that for Wii tennis, and (c) playing Wii boxing compared with that when the high-intensity exercisers group played any Wii games (p > 0.05). The RPE was greater for boxing and cycling compared with that for tennis and step (p > 0.05). Ratings of enjoyment and the increase in positive emotion were greater for boxing and for tennis compared with those for traditional exercises (p > 0.05). Results suggest that Wii boxing shows the greatest potential as a cardiovascular fitness tool among the Wii games, particularly for individuals who typically exercise at lower intensities.",CHHS,Kinesiology,2014.0

The plight of the American middle class has been growing steadily since the early 1980s, and has been compounded further by the recession of 2008-2009 and its aftermath. We extend our prior work by examining the particular effects of long-term middle-class decline and the recent recession on Americans over 55 years old. Our retirement savings simulation presents in stark terms the cumulative disadvantage of working in unsteady jobs with stagnant wages over the course of a late-20th- and early 21st-century work career. In our discussion, we suggest that one cultural adaptation to the retirement savings crisis is the denial of the realities of aging and the suggestion that most age-related problems are temporary and fixable.

Once forensically detected, these same TTPs act as 'fingerprints' (called indicators), locating where the attackers have been elsewhere with a network of host computers. A very commonly used technique to locate compromised systems is to calculate the MD5 hash values for each file within a filesystem and compare against a known 'bad fingerprint' (hash value of known malware components). Our research demonstrates that of all of the indicators, the exhaustive computation of MD5 hash values across the full file contents of every file within the entire filesystem consumes the largest amount of time. Given the goal of reducing the time to determine if a system is compromised, we develop a novel approach to optimizing the creation of these indicators.

The literature suggests a wide range of firm-, industry-, market-, and region-related factors critical for business longevity. The effects of regional characteristics on the likelihood of firm exit are the least studied. This paper contributes to the literature by exploring the relationship between the level of metropolitan innovation and survival in two U.S. high-technology sectors, computer and electronic product manufacturing, and healthcare services. Using non-parametric survival analysis, we estimate the hazard faced by companies in both sectors conditioning it on innovation and controlling for a number of geographical, industrial, regional, and firm characteristics, one at a time. The results suggest that in computer and electronic product manufacturing the effects of innovation are highly dependent on other variables. The general pattern of higher hazard faced by establishments in more innovative regions usually reverses when the focus is on large and expanding companies, as well as on all firms in more agglomerated and industrially diverse environments. In healthcare services, the effect of intervening variables is less pronounced.

Metabolomic profiling allows simultaneous detection of biochemicals originating from cells, organs, or exogenous origin that may be valuable for monitoring of disease severity or in diagnosis. Aim We hypothesized that metabolomics using serum from children would differentiate CF from non-CF lung disease subjects and would provide insight into metabolism in CF. Methods Serum collected from children with CF (n=31) and 31 age and gender matched children with other lung diseases was used for metabolomic profiling by gas- and liquid-chromatography. Relative concentration of metabolites was compared between the groups using partial least square discriminant analyses (PLS-DA) and linear modeling. Results A clear separation of the two groups was seen in PLS-DA. Linear model found that among the 459 detected metabolites 92 differed between CF and non-CF. These included known biochemicals in lipid metabolism, oxidants, and markers consistent with abnormalities in bile acid processing. Bacterial metabolites were identified and differed between the groups indicating intestinal dysbiosis in CF. As a novel finding several pathways were markedly different in CF, which jointly point towards decreased activity in the β-oxidation of fatty acids. These pathways include low ketone bodies, low medium chain carnitines, elevated di-carboxylic acids and decreased 2-hydroxybutyrate from amino acid metabolism in CF compared to non-CF. Conclusion Serum metabolomics discriminated CF from non-CF and show altered cellular energy metabolism in CF potentially reflecting mitochondrial dysfunction.

Despite a definition and pattern of associations with health outcomes highly similar to '. g' (i.e., the general cognitive ability factor), health literacy has been conceptualized as a distinct construct. This study evaluates the conceptual and empirical distinctiveness of health literacy. A sample of 167 students from a southeastern urban university (117 females and 50 males) between the ages of 18 and 53 (M=21.31, SD=5.61) completed a cognitive ability battery, three health literacy tests, two knowledge tests, and a questionnaire assessing 12 health behaviors and health outcomes. Across 36 tests of criterion-related validity, cognitive ability had an effect in all 36 cases, where the health literacy tests only showed measureable incremental validity in 6 of 36 cases. Factor analysis revealed only three factors defined by the traditional ability tests with the health literacy measures loading on the ability factors as predicted by the content validity analysis. There was no evidence of a health literacy factor. The combined results from a comparative content analysis, an empirical factor analysis, and an incremental validity analysis cast doubt on the uniqueness of a health literacy construct. It is suggested that measures of health literacy are simply domain-specific contextualized measures of basic cognitive abilities.

2-s2.0-84898860708,Article,"One of the ultimate goals in robotics is to make robots of high degrees of freedom (DOF) work autonomously in real world environments. However, real world environments are unpredictable, i.e., how the objects move are usually not known beforehand. Thus, whether a robot trajectory is collision-free or not has to be checked on-line based on sensing as the robot moves. Moreover, in order to guarantee safe motion, the motion uncertainty of the robot has to be taken into account. This paper introduces a general approach to detect if a high-DOF robot trajectory is continuously collision-free even in the presence of robot motion uncertainty in an unpredictable environment in real time. Our method is based on the novel concept of dynamic envelope, which takes advantage of progressive sensing over time without predicting motions of objects in an environment or assuming specific object motion patterns. The introduced approach can be used by general real-time motion planners to check if a candidate robot trajectory is continuously and robustly collision-free (i.e., in spite of uncertainty in the robot motion).",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2014.0
2-s2.0-84898895055,Article,"In this work, we present the hierarchical object-driven action rules; a hybrid action rule extraction approach that combines key elements from both the classical action rule mining approach, first proposed by Raś and Wieczorkowska (2000), and the more recent object-driven action rule extraction approach proposed by Hajja et al. (2012, 2013), to extract action rules from object-driven information systems. Action rules, as defined in Raś and Wieczorkowska (2000), are actionable tasks that describe possible transitions of instances from one state to another with respect to a distinguished attribute, called the decision attribute. Recently, a new specialized case of action rules, namely object-driven action rules, has been introduced by Hajja et al. (2012, 2013). Object-driven action rules are action rules that are extracted from information systems with temporal and object-based nature. By object-driven information systems, we mean systems that contain multiple observations for each object, in which objects are determined by an attribute that assumingly defines some unique distribution; and by temporally-based information systems, we refer to systems in which each instance is attached to a timestamp that, by definition, must have an intrinsic meaning for each corresponding instance. Though the notion of object-driven and temporal-based action rules had its own successes, some argue that the essence of object-driven assumptions, which is in big part the reason for its effectiveness, are imposing few limitations as well. Object-driven approaches treat entire systems as multi-subsystems for which action rules are extracted from; as a result, more accurate and specific action rules are extracted. However, by doing so, our diverseness of the extracted action rules are much less apparent, compared to the outcome when applying the classical action rule extraction approach, which treats information systems as a whole. For that reason, we propose a hybrid approach which builds a hierarchy of clusters of subsystems; a novel way of clustering through treatments responses similarities is introduced.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2014.0

Methods: A cross-sectional interview survey of 187 seasonal migrant farmworkers of Mexican descent, identified from labor camps located in rural counties in North Carolina, was conducted using nonprobability purposive sampling approach. Multivariable ordinal logistic regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between perceived control over the harmful effects of pesticide exposure, lack of social support, and the impact of anxiety on perception of pesticide exposure. Results: More than 20% (n=39) of farmworkers reported frequent or constant contact with pesticides while working in the fields. More than 68% of farmworkers reported they believe they have control over avoiding harmful effects of pesticide exposure; the odds of pesticide exposure were 55% lower in this group (adjusted OR: 0.45; 95% CI: 0.22-0.91).

Conclusion: Among patients with diabetes having revascularization, those with diabetes complications have higher risks of in-hospital death and renal failure irrespective of having CABG or PCI.",CHHS,Public Health,2014.0
2-s2.0-84898908000,"General Publications (Press, Editorials, Letters)","Anomaly detection accuracy has been a serious limitation in commercial ADS deployments. A main reason for this limitation is the expectation that an ADS should achieve very high accuracy while having extremely low computational complexity. The constraint of low computational cost has recently been relaxed with the emergence of cheap high-performance platforms (e.g., multi-core, GPU, SCC, etc.). Moreover, current ADSs perform anomaly detection on aggregate feature spaces, with large volumes of benign and close-to-benign feature instances that overwhelm the feature space and hence yield low accuracies. In this paper, we ask and address the following question: Can the accuracy of an ADS be improved if we slice ADS feature space at the cost of higher computational resource utilization? We first observe that existing ADSs are not designed to exploit better computational platforms to achieve higher accuracies. To mitigate this problem, we identify the fundamental accuracy limiting factors for statistical network and host-based ADSs. We then show that these bottlenecks can be alleviated by our proposed feature space slicing framework. Our framework slices a statistical ADS' feature space into multiple disjoint subspaces and then performs anomaly detection separately on each subspace by utilizing more computational resources. We propose generic information-theoretic methods for feature space slicing and for determining the appropriate number of subspaces for any statistical ADS. Performance evaluation on three independently-collected attack datasets and multiple ID algorithms shows that the enhanced ADSs are able to achieve dramatic improvements in detection (up to 75%) and false alarm (up to 99%) rates.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2014.0

One of the major obstacles to this vision lies in the difficulties found in the automatic integration between heterogeneous vocabularies and ontologies that provides the semantic backbone of the growing constellation of open geo-knowledge bases. In this article, we show how to utilize WordNet as a semantic hub to increase the integration of LOD. With this purpose in mind, we devise Voc2WordNet, an unsupervised mapping technique between a given vocabulary and WordNet, combining intensional and extensional aspects of the geographic terms. Voc2WordNet is evaluated against a sample of human-generated alignments with the OpenStreetMap (OSM) Semantic Network, a crowdsourced geospatial resource, and the GeoNames ontology, the vocabulary of a large digital gazetteer.

Although users can share some contents in a social network site with people outside of the social network site using a secret address of content, appropriate access control mechanisms are still not supported. To overcome this limitation, we propose a cross-site interaction framework x-mngr, allowing users to interact with users in other social network sites, with a cross-site access control policy, which enables users to specify policies that allow/deny access to their shared contents across social network sites. We also propose a partial mapping approach based on a supervised learning mechanism to map user’s identities across social network sites. We implemented our proposed framework through a photo album sharing application that shares user’s photos between Facebook and MySpace based on the cross-site access control policy that is defined by the content owner.

In this article, we systematically investigated the potential of these new tools in activating the stringently silenced pluripotency gene Oct4 (Pou5f1) in mouse and human somatic cells. First, with a number of TALEs and sgRNAs targeting various regions in the mouse and human Oct4 promoters, we found that the most efficient TALE-VP64s bound around -120 to -80 bp, while highly effective sgRNAs targeted from -147 to -89-bp upstream of the transcription start sites to induce high activity of luciferase reporters. In addition, we observed significant transcriptional synergy when multiple TFs were applied simultaneously. Although individual TFs exhibited marginal activity to up-regulate endogenous gene expression, optimized combinations of TALE-VP64s could enhance endogenous Oct4 transcription up to 30-fold in mouse NIH3T3 cells and 20-fold in human HEK293T cells. More importantly, the enhancement of OCT4 transcription ultimately generated OCT4 proteins. Furthermore, examination of different epigenetic modifiers showed that histone acetyltransferase p300 could enhance both TALE-VP64 and sgRNA/dCas9-VP64 induced transcription of endogenous OCT4. Taken together, our study suggested that engineered TALE-TF and dCas9-TF are useful tools for modulating gene expression in mammalian cells.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2014.0

The aim of this study was to investigate college students' perceptions toward using mHealth technology to deliver interventions to prevent high-risk drinking and associated consequences. Design/setting: Four focus group interviews were conducted during the spring and fall of 2011 at a large public university in the southeastern United States of America (USA) to collect data on the applicability of mHealth technology to alcohol-prevention programmes. The participants were students currently enrolled in a face-to-face alcohol-prevention programme. Method: Thematic analysis of the content in the transcriptions was used to analyse the focus group responses using a codebook.

To better inform decision modelling, there is a need for cost estimates of specific diabetes-related complications, stratified by diabetes type and patient age group. Objective: To obtain direct medical costs of managing and treating diabetes-related complications over a 2-year period, for adults and children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), using data from a large commercially insured US subscriber database. Methods: We examined records from a large US multi-payer claims database to identify patients with any diabetes-related complications included in nine pre-specified categories, filed between January 2009 and September 2010, and with pre-index evidence of T1DM or T2DM. Patients were required to have continuous health plan enrolment 12 months before and 24 months after each index complication. Patients were classified into cohorts based on their diabetes type and age status at the time of the complication. The direct medical cost associated with each complication was calculated for the 12- and 24-month follow-up periods. Mean paid and allowed total costs were calculated and inflation-adjusted to the year 2011. Results: Of the 119,715 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 211 (0.2 %) were categorized as children with T1DM, 55 (0.05 %) as children with T2DM, 6,227 (5.2 %) as adults with T1DM and 113,222 (94.6 %) as adults with T2DM. The respective mean cohort ages were 13.5, 14.9, 48.5 and 58 years. Proteinuria/albuminuria was the most common complication for T1DM and T2DM child cohorts, with this complication occurring in almost one third of these children. Among the child cohorts, renal disease accounted for the highest mean paid cost for T1DM patients (US$6,053) whereas for T2DM patients, the complication associated with the highest mean paid cost was lactic acidosis (US$25,053). For the adult T1DM cohort, the complications with the highest occurrence and highest mean total paid cost were non-proliferative retinopathy (40.3 %) and renal disease (US$28,076), respectively. Similarly, for the adult T2DM cohort, these complications were neuropathy (26.8 %) and peritoneal dialysis (US$32,826). Conclusion: With the continuing and increasing interest in child and adult T1DM and T2DM, stakeholders will need relevant and timely information to guide treatment decision making.

The absence of an effective vaccine makes strategies to prevent the virus transmission the most effective means of control. The planning of such strategies, however, is difficult due to the constant movement of individuals and mosquito host (Aedes aegypti). In this paper, the spatial and temporal relations that might exist between infected individuals during a dengue-epidemic year are explored. This research is motivated in that a deep understanding of potential transmission patterns between individuals might lead to a better design and planning of control strategies. A GIS-based Health Exploratory AnaLysis Tool (HELP) is used to compute space-time relationships by means of spatial K-function, kernel density, space-time K-function and linking pairs of cases within significant time and space intervals. Significant clustering was observed at a scale of 50 meters and 750 meters, respectively while temporal significance was determined at two days and five to eight days. While an increase of cases occurs in the months following severe droughts due to an El Niño phenomenon, the location of clusters remains relatively stable. These are observed near areas where potential habitats for the mosquito exist such as storm drains, hard surfaces where water accumulates (e.g., vases, containers), but also in poorer neighborhoods.

The agents have a myopic view of their neighboring states that could lead to inconsistent action choices. The fundamental question addressed in this work is how to determine and obtain the minimal overlapping context among decentralized decision makers required to make their decisions more consistent. Our approach is a two-phased learning process where agents first learn their policies offline within the context of a simplified environment where it is not necessary to know detailed context information about neighbors. These local policies are then applied in more complex ""real"" environments where it is expected that agents will encounter a much higher rate of inconsistencies (conflicts) with neighborhood actions. When conflicts are observed, agents switch to ""special"" states that augment local policy states with additional non-local state information and learn other actions to take in this specific situation.

2-s2.0-84899474393,Conference Paper,"Children with autism experience significant positive behavioral and health benefits from exercise, though many of these children tend to lead sedentary lifestyles. Video games that incorporate physical activity, known as exergames, may help to motivate such children to engage in vigorous exercise, thus leading to more healthy lifestyles and reducing the likelihood of obesity. In this paper, we present a study of physical activity and motivation level for ten children with autism as they played an immersive virtual reality exergame that involved fast-paced full-body movement. Our results showed that most children, including non-verbal participants, were able to achieve vigorous activity levels, with several of them maintaining very high levels of exertion. Furthermore, the children reported high levels of enjoyment and indicated they would exercise more often if such games were routinely available. These encouraging findings suggest that exergames are a promising way to empower the families of children with autism with tools to help improve their child's health and quality of life.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2013.0

Using advanced technologies such as ""multi-domain"" software-defined networking, zero-copy RDMA data transfers, active measurements and federated identity/access - accelerated flows are starting to be setup from Science DMZs over wide-area overlay networks, by-passing traditional campus firewalls. In this paper, we present a ""campus Science DMZ reference architecture"" for adaptively managing host-to-host accelerated flows of multiple researchers over wide-area overlay networks with shared underlay infrastructure components. We discuss our novel approaches in handling challenges of policy specification, security enforcement, and performance engineering within Science DMZs to support diverse accelerated flows on a scalable/extensible basis. Lastly, we present a multi-disciplinary case study of a bioinformatics science driver application in a double-ended campus Science DMZ testbed.

Studies have found that abstinence-only programmes do not succeed in preventing young people from becoming sexually active or pregnant; most young people have sexual intercourse in their teenage years long before they even contemplate marriage. The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore how 32 teenage mothers learned about sex and their related views about pregnancy and birth control. Findings indicate that they have often received little accurate information about sex from their parents and schools. Findings also reveal their widely varying views about birth control and pregnancy. Overall, the findings support the need for comprehensive sexuality education that addresses the topics covered in this study in an age-appropriate manner. The findings also suggest ways that helping professionals in other settings besides schools can help young people address these issues.",CHHS,Social Work,2014.0

2-s2.0-84899565656,Conference Paper,"In order that multicast routing characteristics are reflected under wireless environments, multicast routing metric is required for qualifying the multicast tree cost in wireless multi-hop mesh networks. We design a new multicast routing metric called the multicast-tree transmission ratio which quantifies the multicast tree cost, considering the link quality of wireless multicast channels as well as the wireless multicast advantage. The multicast-tree transmission ratio represents the product of the multicast transmission ratios of all nodes in the constructed multicast tree. This paper proposes a wireless multicast routing which constructs the multicast tree by maximizing the multicast-tree transmission ratio in wireless mesh networks. The proposed wireless multicast routing shows a higher delivery ratio and a lower average delay than the multicast routing minimizing the transmission count. In comparison with other multicast routings, simulation results show that the proposed multicast heuristic maximizing the multicast tree transmission ratio constructs a cost-effective multicast tree in terms of its delivery ratio, average delay, and required network resources.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2011.0

The domain is divided into non-overlapping multi-block subdomains. On interfaces of sub-domains, the local multilevel explicit scheme is proposed to solve the interface values of solution, and then the splitting implicit scheme is proposed to solve the solution in interiors of subdomains. On the theoretical aspect, analyzing the S-DDM scheme over non-overlapping multi-block sub-domains is much challenging. We strictly prove the stability and convergence of the S-DDM scheme and obtain the optimal error estimates over non-overlapping multi-block subdomains. Numerical experiments are given to illustrate the accuracy and efficiency of the S-DDM scheme. The developed method takes the most attractive advantages of both the non-overlapping domain decomposition and the splitting technique, which overcomes the limitation of the stripe-divided sub-domains for parabolic equations in the previous methods.

2-s2.0-84899711322,Conference Paper,"Sparse modeling, a feature selection method widely used in the machine-learning community, has been recently applied to identify associations in genetic studies including expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping. These genetic studies usually involve high dimensional data where the number of features is much larger than the number of samples. The high dimensionality of genetic data introduces a problem that there exist multiple solutions for optimizing a sparse model. In such situations, a single optimization result provides only an incomplete view of the data and lacks power to find alternative features associated with the same trait. In this article, we propose a novel method aimed to detecting alternative eQTLs where two genetic variants have alternative relationships regarding their associations with the expression of a particular gene. Our method accomplishes this goal by exploring multiple solutions sampled from the solution space. We proved our method theoretically and demonstrated its usage on simulated data. We then applied our method to a real eQTL data and identified a set of alternative eQTLs with potential biological insights. Additionally, these alternative eQTLs implicate a network view of understanding gene regulation.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2014.0
2-s2.0-84899729318,Article,"Sensitivity analysis is an important step in agent-based modeling of complex adaptive spatial systems to evaluate the contribution of influential variables to model response. Sensitivity analysis of agent-based models is computationally demanding, however, and this analysis tends to be intractable for large agent-based modeling. This computational challenge greatly limits our ability to investigate complex spatial dynamics using large agent-based models. The objective of this study is to gain insight into this computational issue by focusing on the sensitivity analysis of large agent-based modeling of spatial opinion exchange, accelerated using multiple graphics processing units (GPUs). We present a heterogeneous parallel computing approach based on nested parallelism for the global sensitivity analysis of the model. The agent-based opinion model is parallelized using many-core GPUs for the simulation of a large number of spatially aware and interacting agents. These agents exchange opinions for developing consensus on topics through processes of spatial neighborhood search and opinion update. Global sensitivity analysis of the opinion model is conducted using a variance-based approach, requiring numerous model runs for Monte Carlo integration. Intermodel parallelization is introduced to enable Monte Carlo runs of sensitivity analysis. We conduct global sensitivity analysis on a multi-GPU cluster. Experimental results indicate GPU-accelerated general-purpose computation provides an efficacious and feasible solution for the sensitivity analysis of large agent-based models. The heterogeneous parallel computing approach provides valuable insight into large-scale spatiotemporal problem solving by leveraging cyberinfrastructure-enabled computational capabilities.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2014.0
2-s2.0-84899784168,"General Publications (Press, Editorials, Letters)","Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affects an estimated 14% of adults in the United States between the ages of 40 and 79 years. This progressive disease is characterized by persistent airflow limitation. The management of patients with COPD is focused on reducing risk factors, relieving symptoms, and preventing exacerbations. Objective: To examine the peer-reviewed literature on the impact of maintenance therapy on the direct treatment costs of patients with COPD in the United States. Methods: PubMed was searched for articles written in English that were published between 2000 and 2013, using the search terms ""COPD,"" ""economics,"" ""exacerbation,"" ""maintenance,"" and related terms. Articles reporting the results of longitudinal studies of the costs associated with the management of patients with COPD, the costs associated with hospitalizations for acute exacerbations of COPD, and randomized clinical trials evaluating the effects of maintenance therapy on the incidence of COPD exacerbations were included in this review. Results: The search identified a total of 277 articles, and 11 of these articles were deemed appropriate for inclusion in this review. The direct healthcare costs for patients with COPD increased by 38% between 1987 and 2007, and continued to increase by approximately 5% annually between 2006 and 2009. The costs associated with hospital admissions for patients with COPD accounted for the largest absolute increase ($2289 per admission in constant 2007 US dollars). Recent estimates suggest that the aggregate costs associated with the treatment of acute exacerbations are between $3.2 billion and $3.8 billion, and that annual healthcare costs are 10-fold greater for patients with COPD associated with acute exacerbations than for patients with COPD but without exacerbations. The results of 2 large clinical trials of maintenance therapy, including a long-acting cholinergic antagonist or a long-acting beta-2 agonist, showed a 16% to 17% reduction in the incidence of exacerbations compared with placebo. Nevertheless, maintenance therapy remains underutilized, with only 30% to 35% of patients with COPD in private and public health insurance plans receiving prescriptions for maintenance therapy. Conclusions: The treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD remains the major driver of increasing healthcare costs associated with this condition. The appropriate use of maintenance therapy has been shown to reduce the incidence of exacerbations and has the potential to reduce overall costs associated with the management of patients with COPD.",CHHS,Public Health,2014.0

A criticism of these measures is that there is often a discrepancy between the perception of peer behavior and actual peer behavior. The mechanism that is most often discussed regarding the reason underlying misperceptions is projection, or the situation when one respondent uses his/her deviant behavior to describe the behavior of his/her friends. Using data from a large sample of friendship pairs in emerging adulthood, we employ self-reported and perceptual measures of substance use to determine how the gender structure of friendship dyads affects the construction of perceptions of a peer's substance use. We examine the projection hypothesis generally, but our specific interest lies in how both the gender of the respondent and the gender composition of the dyad affect the cognitive perception of a close friend's use of drugs. Results indicate that perceptions vary greatly across friendships of different gender structures, and those in split gender friendships generate perceptions that most closely reflect the peer's actual use patterns.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Criminal Justice and Criminology,2014.0

It uses coded light to encode the position of user's mobile device in an environment. By attaching a tiny light sensor on a user's mobile device, the user can attach digital information to arbitrary static physical objects or retrieve/modify the attached information as well. With this system, a family member may attach a digital maintenance schedule to a fish tank or indoor plants so that all family members may retrieve that for maintenance reference. In a store, a store manager may use such a system to attach price tag, discount information and multimedia content to any products and customers can get the attached information by moving their phone close to the focused product. Similarly, a museum can use this system to provide extra information of displayed items to visitors. Different from computer vision based systems, HiFi does not depend on object's texture and illumination, etc. Different from regular barcode approaches, HiFi does not require extra physical attachments that may change an object's native appearance.

2-s2.0-84899890103,Article,"Le Châtelier's principle is the cornerstone of our understanding of chemical equilibria. When a system at equilibrium undergoes a change in concentration or thermodynamic state (i.e., temperature, pressure, etc.), La Châtelier's principle states that an equilibrium shift will occur to offset the perturbation and a new equilibrium is established. We demonstrate that the effects of stabilizing mutations on the rigidity ⇔ flexibility equilibrium within the native state ensemble manifest themselves through enthalpy-entropy compensation as the protein structure adjusts to restore the global balance between the two. Specifically, we characterize the effects of mutation to single chain fragments of the anti-lymphotoxin-β receptor antibody using a computational Distance Constraint Model. Statistically significant changes in the distribution of both rigidity and flexibility within the molecular structure is typically observed, where the local perturbations often lead to distal shifts in flexibility and rigidity profiles. Nevertheless, the net gain or loss in flexibility of individual mutants can be skewed. Despite all mutants being exclusively stabilizing in this dataset, increased flexibility is slightly more common than increased rigidity. Mechanistically the redistribution of flexibility is largely controlled by changes in the H-bond network. For example, a stabilizing mutation can induce an increase in rigidity locally due to the formation of new H-bonds, and simultaneously break H-bonds elsewhere leading to increased flexibility distant from the mutation site via Le Châtelier. Increased flexibility within the VH β4/β5 loop is a noteworthy illustration of this long-range effect.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2014.0

Using an array of information asymmetry measures to represent the complex information environment of corporations, we find a significant decrease in information asymmetry following index inclusions but show that the drop provides limited explanatory power for the announcement return. On the other hand, we find strong support for an increase in information asymmetry after deletion events, and firms with a higher level of information asymmetry prior to deletion accrue larger losses upon deletion announcements. Finally, relative to the behaviour of other firms in the S&P 500 Index, forecast error declines but forecast optimism remains consistent following index inclusions for newly added firms. This study adds to the ongoing debate over demand curves for S&P 500 Index stocks and shows that changes in information asymmetry are a significant determinant of the price reaction for newly removed firms.",Business,Finance,2014.0
2-s2.0-84899949037,Article,"Objective: Although polymorphisms of the NOD2 gene predispose to the development of ileal Crohn's disease, the precise mechanisms of this increased susceptibility remain unclear. Previous work has shown that transcript expression of the Paneth cell (PC) antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) α-defensin 4 and α-defensin-related sequence 10 are selectively decreased in Nod2-/- mice. However, the specific mouse background used in this previous study is unclear. In light of recent evidence suggesting that mouse strain strongly influences PC antimicrobial activity, we sought to characterise PC AMP function in commercially available Nod2-/- mice on a C57BL/6 (B6) background. Specifically, we hypothesised that Nod2 -/- B6 mice would display reduced AMP expression and activity. Design: Wild-type (WT) and Nod2-/- B6 ileal AMP expression was assessed via real-time PCR, acid urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. PCs were enumerated using flow cytometry. Functionally, α-defensin bactericidal activity was evaluated using a gel-overlay antimicrobial assay. Faecal microbial composition was determined using 454-sequencing of the bacterial 16S gene in cohoused WT and Nod2-/- littermates. Results: WT and Nod2-/- B6 mice displayed similar PC AMP expression patterns, equivalent α-defensin profiles, and identical antimicrobial activity against commensal and pathogenic bacterial strains. Furthermore, minimal differences in gut microbial composition were detected between the two cohoused, littermate mouse groups. Conclusions: Our data reveal that Nod2 does not directly regulate PC antimicrobial activity in B6 mice. Moreover, we demonstrate that previously reported Nod2-dependent influences on gut microbial composition may be overcome by environmental factors, such as cohousing with WT littermates.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2014.0

In general, the most robust predictors of negative events are gender, alcohol use frequency, age of alcohol use onset, and increasing drinking due to happy hours/bar specials. While it was linked to various negative and illegal behaviors, altered happy hour drinking was not associated with an increased likelihood of an alcohol-related arrest.Conclusions: This study lends support to the idea that alcohol price specials should be regulated in an effort to reduce high consumption and alcohol-related negative consequences. Future research into the relationship between happy hour drinking and negative outcomes is necessary and should examine the impact of happy hour advertisements, different types of specials, and the timing of happy hours.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Criminal Justice and Criminology,2014.0

2-s2.0-84900033087,Article,"Interoperability is a crucial organizational capability that enables firms to manage information systems (IS) from heterogeneous trading partners in a value network. While interoperability has been discussed conceptually in the IS literature, few comprehensive empirical studies have been conducted to conceptualize this construct and examine it in depth. For instance, it is unclear how interoperability is formed and whether it can improve organizational performance. To fill the gap, we argue that interorganizational systems (IOS) standards are a key information technology infrastructure facilitating formation of interoperability. As an organizational ability to work with external trading partners, interoperability's development depends not only on capability building within firm boundaries but also on community readiness across firm boundaries. Using data collected from 194 organizations in the geospatial industry, we empirically confirm that interoperability is formed via these two different paths.

2-s2.0-84900424260,Article,"A network perspective has increasingly become an organizing paradigm for understanding regional spatial structure. This paper begins with a critical overview of existing empirical models for estimating intercity networks based on corporate linkages. Extending a recently proposed primary linkage algorithm by Hennemann and Derudder, this paper advances a new method for approximating urban network with locational strategies of firms. The new method considers both regional and hierarchical network features, and avoids information loss that is typical for the conversion between two-mode intercity corporate networks and one-mode intercity networks. In addition, networks estimated by the new method are suitable to be used with social network analytics. The newly proposed method is empirically validated with intercity corporate networks formed by advanced producer service (APS) firms in China's two largest metropolitan regions: Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and Pearl River Delta (PRD). The empirical analysis suggests that (1) in contrast with conventional methods (e.g., the interlocking city network model), our new method would produce regional and hierarchical urban networks that more closely resemble the reality; and (2) the new method allows the effective use of social network analytics such as betweenness and closeness centralities. Nevertheless, the authors note that the validity of any approximation methods for urban networks depends on the soundness of underlying assumptions about how network actors (firms, in our case) interact with each other.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2014.0

In this paper we present an implicit time-stepping scheme for dynamic simulation of multibody systems with intermittent contact by incorporating the contact constraints as a set of complementarity and algebraic equations within the dynamics model. We model each body as an intersection of convex inequalities and write the contact constraints as complementarity constraints between the contact force and a distance function dependent on the closest points on the bodies. The closest points satisfy a set of algebraic constraints obtained from the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of the minimum distance problem. We prove that these algebraic equations and the complementarity constraints taken together ensure satisfaction of the contact constraints. This enables us to formulate a geometrically implicit time-stepping scheme (i.e. we do not need to approximate the distance function) as a nonlinear complementarity problem. The resulting time-stepper is therefore more accurate and does not rely on a closed-form distance function. We demonstrate through example simulations the fidelity of this approach to analytical solutions and previously described simulation and experimental results.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2014.0

In this paper, we investigated lncRNA-disease associations from a network view to understand the contribution of these lncRNAs to complex diseases. Specifically, we studied both the properties of the diseases in which the lncRNAs were implicated, and that of the lncRNAs associated with complex diseases. Regarding the fact that protein coding genes and lncRNAs are involved in human diseases, we constructed a coding-non-coding gene-disease bipartite network based on known associations between diseases and disease-causing genes. We then applied a propagation algorithm to uncover the hidden lncRNA-disease associations in this network. The algorithm was evaluated by leave-one-out cross validation on 103 diseases in which at least two genes were known to be involved, and achieved an AUC of 0.7881. Our algorithm successfully predicted 768 potential lncRNA-disease associations between 66 lncRNAs and 193 diseases. Furthermore, our results for Alzheimer's disease, pancreatic cancer, and gastric cancer were verified by other independent studies.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2014.0

Using large volumes of user-generated mobile phone data, we derive mobile communication profiles that we use as a proxy for the collective human activity. In this article, geocomputational methods and geovisual analytics such as self-organizing maps (SOM) are used to explore the variations of these profiles, and its implications for collective human activity. We evaluate the merits of SOM as a cross-dimensional clustering technique and derived temporal trajectories of variations within the mobile communication profiles. The trajectories characteristics such as length are discussed, suggesting spatial variations in intensity and similarity in collective human activity. Trajectories are linked back to the geographic space to map the spatial and temporal variation of trajectory characteristics. Different trajectory lengths suggest that mobile phone activity is correlated with the spatial configuration of the city, and so at different times of the day. Our approach contributes to the understanding of the space-time social dynamics within urban environments.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2014.0
2-s2.0-84900464819,Article,"Background: Disc degeneration and its associated low back pain are a major health care concern causing disability with a prominent role in this country's medical, social and economic structure. Low back pain is devastating and influences the quality of life for millions. Low back pain lifetime prevalence approximates 80% with an estimated direct cost burden of $86 billion per year. Back pain patients incur higher costs, greater health care utilization, and greater work loss than patients without back pain. Methods: Research was performed following approval of our Institutional Review Board. DNA was isolated, processed and amplified using routine techniques. Amplified DNA was hybridized to Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Arrays. Quality control and genotyping analysis were performed using Affymetrix Genotyping Console. The Birdseed v2 algorithm was used for genotyping analysis. 2589 SNPs were selected a priori to enter statistical analysis using lotistic regression in SAS. Results: Our objective was to search for novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with disc degeneration. Four SNPs were found to have a significant relationship to disc degeneration; three are novel. Rs 165656, a new SNP found to be associated with disc degeneration, was in catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), a gene with well-recognized pain involvement, especially in female subjects (p=0.01). Analysis confirmed the previously association between COMT SNP rs4633 and disc degeneration. We also report two novel disc degeneration-related SNPs (rs2095019 and rs470859) located in intergenic regions upstream to thrombospondin 2. Conclusions: Findings contribute to the challenging field of disc degeneration and pain, and are important in light of the high clinical relevance of low back pain and the need for improved understanding of its fundamental basis.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2014.0

Methods: Middle and high school students (n = 1972) in randomly selected classes within a Southeastern school district completed a battery of self-report measures. Levels of self-control (an individual-level factor) and neighborhood disorganization (a neighborhood-level factor) were regressed onto measures of the six-week prevalence of verbal, physical, and cyber bullying victimization. Results: Low self-control and neighborhood disorder were found to be associated with each type of bullying victimization, though the impact of self-control was partially mediated by neighborhood disorder when included in the same model. The effect of self-control was mediated when subsequently controlling for poly-victimization experiences. Net of these controls, neighborhood disorder continued to be associated with a statistically significant increase in the odds of bullying victimization. Conclusions: Economic and social decay within neighborhoods increased the likelihood of bullying victimizations. These effects hold true across verbal, physical and cyber victimizations, suggesting a need to consider both community characteristics when staging bullying intervention campaigns. Additionally, the findings suggest a need for further research considering the relationship between self-control and neighborhood conditions on the risk of victimization generally.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Criminal Justice and Criminology,2014.0
2-s2.0-84900775244,"General Publications (Press, Editorials, Letters)","Rural America is progressing through a dramatic and sustained post-industrial economic transition. For many, traditional means of household sustenance gained through agriculture, mining and rustic tourism are giving way to large scale corporate agriculture, footloose and globally competitive manufacturing firms, and mass tourism on an unprecedented scale. These changes have brought about an increased presence of affluent amenity migrants and returnees, as well as growing reliance on low-wage, seasonal jobs to sustain rural household incomes. This book argues that the character of rural housing reflects this transition and examines this using contemporary concepts of exurbanization, rural amenity-based development, and comparative distributional descriptions of the ""haves"" and the ""have nots"". Despite rapid in-migration and dramatic changes in land use, there remains a strong tendency for communities in rural America to maintain the idyllic small-town myth of large-lot, single-family home-ownership. This neglects to take into account the growing need for affordable housing (both owner-occupied and rental properties) for local residents and seasonal workers. This book suggests that greater emphasis be placed in rural housing policies that account for this rapid social and economic change and the need for affordable rural housing alternatives.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2011.0

However, there is limited data on the effects of aging on GH responses to acute bouts of heavy resistance exercise (HRE) and aerobic exercise (AE). Design: The present investigation examined the effects of a HRE protocol and an AE protocol on immunoreactive GH (IGH) and bioactive GH (BGH) in active young and old women. Results: Older women had a diminished serum IGH response to both the HRE and AE protocols compared to the younger women, however a similar response was not observed in serum BGH. Additionally, the HRE protocol elicited a greater BGH response than the AE protocol exclusively in the younger group. Conclusions: Regardless of exercise mode, aging induces an increase in growth hormone polymerization that specifically results in a loss of serum growth hormone immunoreactivity without a concurrent loss of serum growth hormone bioactivity. The greater BGH response to the HRE protocol found in the younger group can be attributed to an unknown serum factor of molecular weight between 30 and 55. kD that either potentiated growth hormone bioactivity in response to HRE or inhibited growth hormone bioactivity in response to AE.",CHHS,Kinesiology,2014.0

However, returns to engagement vary across racial and ethnic groups. Scholars have established that human agency is constrained by organizational environments, but they have not adequately assessed whether the advantages associated with engagement and the disadvantages associated with disengagement accrue evenly to groups of students depending on the educational environment. Using ECLS-K data, we examine how one aspect of schools' organizational culture-Collective Pedagogical Teacher Culture-moderates the relationship between engagement and mathematics achievement for students of different racial/ethnic groups in elementary school. Our study suggests that exhibiting the attributes that are valued in American society, i.e., academic engagement or, more abstractly, a strong ethic toward working academically, is not sufficient for the mathematics achievement of many students-especially minority youth. Students must study in environments that nourish and capitalize upon those attributes so that diverse students can enhance their academic trajectories.

Methods: Prospective study of mid-follicular phase endometrium in 47 subjects in two phases: microarray study of 10 infertile women with endometriosis and five fertile controls, and a quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) study of 27 infertile women with endometriosis and 15 fertile controls. Gene expression was determined by DNA microarray, and qRT-PCR used for 12 ""promising"" genes based on the microarray analysis. Results: Compared to fertile controls, women with stage I-II endometriosis had 23, and women with stage III-IV had 35 genes that were significantly up- or down-regulated by microarray. However, using qRT-PCR, only chemokine ligand (CXCL) 13 was significantly down-regulated and somatostatin was significantly up-regulated with early endometriosis, and only CXCL 14 was significantly down-regulated with advanced endometriosis compared to fertile controls. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that the pattern of gene expression in proliferative-phase endometrium is different when comparing tissue from patients with endometriosis versus fertile controls.

By analyzing children's television for its portrayal of race and ethnicity, this chapter will explore the role media play in children's understanding of people and cultures outside of their own. A textual analysis of episodes of Maya & Miguel, the chapter describes the depiction of several cultures found represented on the program including White, Asian, African, Dominican, and Mexican and how race, ethnicity, and culture is framed in the television program. Some theories suggest that television is a primary tool in the socialization of children. Children are attracted to the animation in cartoons, the colors, the movement and the easy-to-follow simplicity of the dialogue. Given the impressionable nature of children, it is possible that they begin to act out the biased nature of the cartoons they watch. Thus, considering their vulnerability, information literacy is relevant to discerning media messages. In this way, information literacy converges with media literacy and visual literacy. Guiding children to interrogate what they view is critically important especially when they are at an age where they can be easily influenced by misinformation or dominant messages. Additionally, the volume of information is steadily increasing in the 21st century as are the modes for accessing, creating and manipulating information. Thus, this work will demonstrate how promoting participatory learning by objectively viewing media and exercising reflective thinking will be important components of children's education in this millennium.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Africana Studies,2013.0

Here, we use geospatial analytics to examine the degree to which the hydrologic connectivity of landscapes influences the transport of passively dispersed microbes, using the invasive plant pathogen Phytophthora ramorum as a case study. Pathogen occurrence was analyzed at 280 stream baiting stations across a range of watersheds - exposed to variable inoculum pressure - in California over a 7-year period (2004-2010). Using logistic regression, we modeled the probability of pathogen occurrence at a baiting station based on nine environmental variables. We developed a novel geospatial approach to quantify the hydrologic connectivity of host vegetation and inoculum pressure derived from least cost distance analyses in each watershed. We also examined the influence of local environmental conditions within the immediate neighborhood of a baiting station. Over the course of the sampling period, the pathogen was detected at 67 baiting stations associated with coastal watersheds with mild climate conditions, steep slopes, and higher levels of inoculum pressure. At the watershed scale, hydrologic landscape connectivity was a key predictor of pathogen occurrence in streams after accounting for variation in climate and exposure to inoculum.

One is to simulate large deformation and force response of a tongue under multi-region contacts with a dental mirror, and the other is to simulate the force response when a dental probe inserts into a narrow periodontal pocket, which leads to simultaneous contacts of different types between the probe and both rigid and deformable objects (i.e., a rigid tooth and its surrounding deformable gingiva), which we call hybrid contacts, as well as frequent contact switches. In this paper, we address both challenges. We first introduce a novel method for modeling deformation based on a sphere-tree representation of deformable objects. A configuration-based constrained optimization method is utilized for determining the six-dimensional configuration of the graphic tool and the contact force/torque. This approach conducts collision detection, deformation computation, and tool configuration optimization very efficiently, avoids inter-penetration, and maintains stability of haptic display without using virtual coupling. To simulate the force response due to fine manipulation of the probe inside a narrow periodontal pocket, we propose an efficient method to simulate the local deformation of the gingiva and stable haptic feedback under frequent contact switches.

One limitation of traditional deformable models is that the information extracted from the image data may contain gross errors, which adversely affect the deformation accuracy. To alleviate this issue, we introduce a new family of deformable models that are inspired from the compressed sensing, a technique for accurate signal reconstruction by harnessing some sparseness priors. In this paper, we employ sparsity constraints to handle the outliers or gross errors, and integrate them seamlessly with deformable models. The proposed new formulation is applied to the analysis of cardiac motion using tagged magnetic resonance imaging (tMRI), where the automated tagging line tracking results are very noisy due to the poor image quality.

However, reliability data for lower stability levels, associated with more pronounced learning curves, are rare in the existing literature. Thus, it is likely that BSS scores obtained from lower stability levels require greater familiarization (i.e. practice) to achieve a stable score both within and between test sessions. Therefore, the purpose of this investigation was to determine if a commonly reported 6 trial sequence (3 practice trials, 3 test trials) used with the BSS can achieve a stable within session score on the lowest stability level (i.e. level 1). The secondary purpose was to evaluate the test-retest reliability of the lowest BSS resistance level over a 10-week period. Twenty sedentary university students (11 male, 9 female; age: 21.5 ± 1.9 years, height: 1.7 ± 0.1 m, weight: 66.3 ± 12.1 kg, BMI: 22.4 ± 2.3) voluntarily participated. Participants completed two test sessions separated by 10-weeks. Twelve, 20-second trials (six dual limb stance, six single limb stance on the dominant limb) on the lowest stability level were completed during both test sessions by all participants. A stable within session dual and single limb stance score was achieved with a maximum of 3 familiarization trials. Reliability ranged between poor and good across all outcomes but all outcomes had large minimal detectable change scores. At least 3 stance specific familiarization trials are needed to achieve a stable BSS score within a single test session on the lowest resistance level.

Given the hardness of 3D localization, we propose a set of greedy methods to pick the anchor set and its visiting sequence. Aiming at minimizing the localization errors, we also adopt a confidence-based approach for all proposed methods to deal with noisy ranging measurements (which is very common in ocean sensor networks) and possible flip ambiguity. Our simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of all proposed methods.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2014.0

Most existing keyword-based image search engines may return large amounts of junk images (which are irrelevant to the given query word), because the text terms that are loosely associated with the Web images are also used for image indexing. The objective of the proposed work is to effectively filter out the junk images from image search results. Therefore, bilingual image search results for the same keyword-based query are integrated to identify the clusters of the junk images and the clusters of the relevant images. Within relevant image clusters, the results are further refined by removing the duplications under a coarse-to-fine structure. Experiments for a large number of bilingual keyword-based queries (5,000 query words) are simultaneously performed on two keyword-based image search engines (Google Images in English and Baidu Images in Chinese), and our experimental results have shown that integrating bilingual image search results can filter out the junk images effectively.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2014.0
2-s2.0-84902006307,Article,"The rapid propagation of vector-borne diseases, such as dengue fever, poses a threat to vulnerable populations, especially those in tropical regions. Prompt space-time analyses are critical elements for accurate outbreak detection and mitigation purposes. Open access web-based geospatial tools are particularly critical in developing countries lacking GIS software and expertise. Currently, online geospatial tools for the monitoring of surveillance data are confined to the mapping of aggregated data. In this paper, we present a web-based geospatial toolkit with a user-friendly interactive interface for the monitoring of dengue fever outbreaks, in space and time. Our geospatial toolkit is designed around the integration of (1) a spatial data management module in which epidemiologists upload spatio-temporal explicit data, (2) an analytical module running an accelerated Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to map the outbreaks of dengue fever, (3) a spatial database module to extract pairs of disease events close in space and time and (4) a GIS mapping module to visualize space-time linkages of pairs of disease events. We illustrate our approach on a set of dengue fever cases which occurred in Cali (659 geocoded cases), an urban environment in Colombia. Results indicate that dengue fever cases are significantly clustered, but the degree of intensity varies across the city. The design and implementation of the on-line toolkit underscores the benefits of the approach to monitor vector-borne disease outbreaks in a timely manner and at different scales, facilitating the appropriate allocation of resources. The toolkit is designed collaboratively with health epidemiologists and is portable for other surveillance data at the individual level such as crime or traffic accidents.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2014.0

We propose a robust method to estimate the land value gap between the land granting price paid by the developer and the rural resident's compensation for the expropriated land. The study shows that the land value gap manifests dramatic variability. While, on average, expropriation charges amount to 15 per cent of the estimated market value of land, this share is under 5 per cent in about a quarter of all rural expropriation cases.

This issue is critical for further theoretical development in the field and holds high practical relevance, given that the appointment or exclusion of family managers is a decision virtually any family firm is faced with. To explain inconsistencies in the literature, we build on the socioemotional wealth perspective to argue that family management is positively related to profitability at later generational stages, when a decreased need for socioemotional wealth preservation induces family managers to focus more on increasing financial wealth. We tested and confirmed our hypothesis via OLS regression on a data set of 233 Italian family-owned firms utilizing lagged data on profitability.",Business,Management,2014.0

These populations are located in the western panhandle of Florida and nearby areas of Georgia, in the Savannah River delta of South Carolina, and on Sassafras Mt. in South Carolina. This range extends over as much as 500 km, which is very large for a species of cyphophthalmid harvestmen and presents a degree of physical separation among populations such that we would expect them to actually be distinguishable species. We examined the morphology, including the spermatopositors of males, and sequences from 221 specimens. We found no discernible differences in the morphologies of specimens from the different populations, but corrected pairwise distances of COI were about 15% among the three population centers. We also ana-lyzed COI data using a General Mixed Yule Coalescent (GMYC) model implemented in the R package SPLITS; with a single threshold, the most likely model had four species within Metasiro. Given this level of molecular divergence, the monophyly of the population haplotypes, and the number of exclusive COI nucleotide and amino acid differences distin-guishing the populations, we here raise the Savannah River and Sassafras Mt. populations to species status: M. savanna-hensis sp. nov., and M. sassafrasensis sp. nov., respectively. This restricts M. americanus (Davis, 1933) to just the Lower Chattahoochee Watershed, which in this study includes populations along the Apalachicola River and around Florida Cav-erns State Park. GMYC models reconstructed the two main haplotype clades within M. americanus as different species, but they are not exclusive to different areas.

2-s2.0-84902276217,Article,"Aim: Biologists increasingly recognize the roles of humans in ecosystems. Subsequently, many have argued that biodiversity conservation must be extended to environments that humans have shaped directly. Yet popular biogeographical frameworks such as biomes do not incorporate human land use, limiting their relevance to future conservation planning. 'Anthromes' map global ecological patterns created by sustained direct human interactions with ecosystems. In this paper, we set to understand how current conservation efforts are distributed across anthromes. Location: Global. Methods: We analysed the global distribution of IUCN protected areas and biodiversity hotspots by anthrome. We related this information to density of native plant species and density of previous ecological studies. Potential conservation opportunities in anthromes were then identified through global analysis and two case studies. Results: Protected areas and biodiversity hotspots are not distributed equally across anthromes. Less populated anthromes contain a greater proportion of protected areas. The fewest hotspots are found within densely settled anthromes and wildlands, which occur at the two extremes of human population density. Opportunities for representative protection, prioritization, study and inclusion of native species were not congruent. Main conclusions: Researchers and practitioners can use the anthromes framework to analyse the distribution of conservation practices at the global and regional scale. Like biomes, anthromes could also be used to set future conservation priorities. Conservation goals in areas directly shaped by humans need not be less ambitious than those in 'natural areas'.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2014.0
2-s2.0-84902304741,Article,"Background: The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) can provide insights into perceived need for cocaine treatment among African American cocaine users. Methods: A cross-sectional community sample of 400 (50% rural) not-in-treatment African-American cocaine users was identified through respondent-driven sampling in one urban and two rural counties in Arkansas. Measures included self-reports of attitudes and beliefs about cocaine treatment, perceived need and perceived effectiveness of treatment, and positive and negative cocaine expectancies. Normative beliefs were measured by perceived stigma and consequences of stigma regarding drug use and drug treatment. Perceived control was measured by readiness for treatment, prior drug treatment, and perceived ability to cut down on cocaine use without treatment. Findings: Multiple regression analysis found that older age (standardized regression coefficient β. = 0.15, P<. 0.001), rural residence (β. = -. 0.09, P= 0.025), effectiveness of treatment (β. = 0.39, P<. 0.001), negative cocaine expectancies (β. = 0.138, P= 0.003), experiences of rejection (β. = 0.18, P<. 0.001), need for secrecy (β. = 0.12, P= 0.002), and readiness for treatment (β. = 0.15, P<. 0.001) were independently associated with perceived need for cocaine treatment.

The bulk of this evidence has been derived from correlational studies and from cases over relatively condensed time frames. Methods: The current study uses data from North Carolina (n. = 1,113) over several decades (1977-2009) to evaluate the link between defendant/victim racial dyad and jury death penalty decision-making. Results: Results suggest that there is an apparent ""White victim effect"" that can be observed in death penalty decision-making in traditional logistic regression models. Yet, once cases are matched via propensity score matching on approximately 50 case characteristics/confounders including the type of aggravators and mitigators accepted by the jury in addition to the number of aggravators and mitigators accepted, the relationship is rendered insignificant. Furthermore, these results hold for a defendant of any race killing a White victim and for the ""most disadvantaged"" situation for Black defendants (e.g., cases with White victims). Conclusions: The ""White victim effect"" on capital punishment decision-making is better considered as a ""case effect"" rather than a ""race effect."".",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Criminal Justice and Criminology,2014.0

However, the role of attention driven by explicit verbal instructions while dual-tasking is less understood. Therefore, the purpose of this investigation is to determine the effects of explicit verbal instructions on the postural-suprapostural interactions among various domains of working memory. A total of 22 healthy young adults with a heterogeneous history of ankle sprains volunteered to participate (age: 22.2 ± 5.1 years; n= 10 history of ankle sprains, n= 12 no history). Participants were asked to perform single-limb balance trials while performing three suprapostural tasks: backwards counting, random number generation, and the manikin test. In addition, each suprapostural task was completed under three conditions of instruction: no instructions, focus on the postural control task, focus on the suprapostural task. The results indicate a significant effect of instructions on postural control outcomes, with postural performance improving in the presence of instructions across all three cognitive tasks which each stress different aspects of working memory. Further, postural-suprapostural interactions appear to be related to the direction or focus of an individual's attention as instructions to focus on the suprapostural task resulted in the greatest postural control improvements. Thus, attention driven by explicit verbal instructions influence postural-suprapostural interactions as measured by a temporal-spatial postural control outcome, time-to-boundary, regardless of the suprapostural task performed.",CHHS,Kinesiology,2014.0

On their way they can interact with membrane and intracellular proteins. To fully understand and improve CPP efficiency as drug delivery tools, their partners need to be identified. To investigate CPP-protein complexes, chemical cross-linking coupled to mass spectrometry is a relevant method. With this aim, we developed an original approach based on two parallel strategies, an intact complex analysis and a bottom-up one, to have a global characterization of the cross-linked complexes composition as well as a detailed mapping of the interaction zones. Biological significance: The robust and efficient cross-linking-MS workflow presented here can easily be adapted to any CPP-protein interacting system and could thus contribute to a better understanding of CPPs activity as cell-specific drug delivery tools. We validated the relevancy of this cross-linking-MS approach with two biologically active CPPs, (R/W)9 and (R/W)16, and two interacting protein partners, actin and albumin, previously reported using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and NMR. Cross-linking-MS results obtained on these previous studies allowed us to go further by providing a detailed mapping of the interaction zones. The identified interaction zones between actin and CPPs (R/W)9 and (R/W)16 are biologically meaningful. Two cross-linked zones [46-57] and [202-210] of actin are indeed involved in the modulation of its dynamics.

Using cross-sectional survey data, we tested a hypothesized predictive model using structural equation modeling; the model was observed to fit well with the data. When teachers lack immediacy, are unclear, and/or demonstrate poor communication competence, students tend to report heightened negative emotional reactions.

Two scenarios, viz. (a) low mobility for network nodes, and (b) high degree of node mobility, are evaluated. Scenario (a) is proven to be NP-hard and scenario (b) is proven to be #P-hard for the adversary to realize the goal. Further, several approximation algorithms are presented which show that even in the best case scenario it is at least exponentially hard for the adversary to optimally succeed in such blocking-type attacks.

The proposed Vintage Flexible Capacitated Location Problem (ViFCLP) has the flexibility to account for a minimum school-age closing requirement, while the maximum capacity of each school can be adjusted by the addition of modular units. Non-closest assignments are controlled by the introduction of a parameter penalizing excess travel. The applicability of the ViFCLP is illustrated on a large US school system (Charlotte-Mecklenburg, North Carolina) where high school demand is expected to grow faster with distance to the city center.

Because of alternative splicing, the GR exists as two isoforms, GRα and GRβ. The growth inhibitory actions of GCs are mediated via GRα, a hormone-induced transcription factor. The GRβ isoform, however, lacks helix 12 of the ligand-binding domain and cannot bind GCs. While we have previously shown that GRβ mRNAis responsive to insulin, the role of GRβ in insulin signaling and growth pathways is unknown. In the present study, we show that GRβ suppresses PTEN expression, leading to enhanced insulin-stimulated growth. These characteristics were independent of the inhibitory qualities that have been reported for GRβ on GRα. Additionally, we found that GRβ increased phosphorylation of Akt basally, which was further amplified following insulin treatment. In particular, GRβ specifically targets Akt1 in growth pathways.

However, in a typical hospital scenario, patients may have a variable number of diagnoses and this data is recorded in the patients' medical records in a random order. Treatments are prescribed based on these diagnoses, which makes it harder to mine meta-actions from healthcare datasets. In such scenario, the patients are not necessarily followed for a specific disease, but are treated for what they are diagnosed for. This makes it even more complex to prescribe personalized treatments since patients react differently to treatments based on their state (diagnoses). In this work, we present a method to extract personalized meta-actions from surgical datasets with variable number of diagnoses. We used the Florida State Inpatient Databases (SID), which is a part of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) [1] to demonstrate how to extract meta-actions and evaluate them.",CHHS,Public Health,2014.0

The answers to the questions were consistently mixed. Generally, the presence of school improvement planning is prevalent in the large majority of districts. However, the data indicate a lack of fidelity to the process between superintendents' beliefs regarding the process and how they perceive those tasked with development and implementation of the process. Given that school improvement planning is an internationally accepted process, the findings have implications not just for the USA but for international audiences as well. The authors make two recommendations: (1) significant further research into the effects of the process on student learning, and (2) continued research into the reasons for the lack of congruency indicated here between district expectations and school development and implementation.",Education,Educational Leadership,2014.0
2-s2.0-84903590672,Article,"Purpose: Racial and geographic disparities in human immunodeficency virus (HIV) are dramatic and drug use is a significant contributor to HIV risk. Within the rural South, African Americans who use drugs are at extremely high risk. Due to the importance of religion within African American and rural Southern communities, it can be a key element of culturally-targeted health promotion with these populations. Studies have examined religion's relationship with sexual risk in adolescent populations, but few have examined specific religious behaviors and sexual risk behaviors among drug-using African American adults. This study examined the relationship between well-defined dimensions of religion and specific sexual behaviors among African Americans who use cocaine living in the rural southern United States. Methods: Baseline data from a sexual risk reduction intervention for African Americans who use cocaine living in rural Arkansas (N = 205) were used to conduct bivariate and multivariate analyses examining the association between multiple sexual risk behaviors and key dimensions of religion including religious preference, private and public religious participation, religious coping, and God-based, congregation-based, and church leader-based religious support. Findings: After adjusting individualized network estimator weights based on the recruitment strategy, different dimensions of religion had inverse relationships with sexual risk behavior, including church leadership support with number of unprotected vaginal/anal sexual encounter and positive religious coping with number of sexual partners and with total number of vaginal/anal sexual encounters. Conclusion: Results suggest that specific dimensions of religion may have protective effects on certain types of sexual behavior, which may have important research implications.",CHHS,Public Health,2014.0

Data coming from the MRI, EMG or microrecording all have its special properties that have to be extracted during the process analysis. In case of recordings coming from the microrecording procedure i.e. from microelectrodes placed within the neuronal tissue signal can be analyzed in at least two ways. First approach focuses on the background noise present in such recordings. Second one, looks upon the presence of the spikes - electrical signs of the bioelectrical neurophysiological activity of neuron cells. In a given recording one may often find many spikes with different shapes. For further analytical reasons it is frequently desired that spikes are to be grouped according to their shape. Such grouping / shape clustering is called spike sorting and there are many known approaches to that problem. Still, before spikes are detected and sorted the raw recorded signal is almost always filtered and altered in various DSP processes. This preliminary DSP operations may significantly hamper the spike sorting efficiency. Analysis presented in this paper provides answer as to which frequency bands are alone sufficient for proper and successful spike sorting.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2014.0

2-s2.0-84903747545,Article,"The management of large-scale distributed information systems relies on the effective use and modeling of monitoring data collected at various points in the distributed information systems. A traditional approach to model monitoring data is to discover invariant relationships among the monitoring data. Indeed, we can discover all invariant relationships among all pairs of monitoring data and generate invariant networks, where a node is a monitoring data source (metric) and a link indicates an invariant relationship between two monitoring data. Such an invariant network representation can help system experts to localize and diagnose the system faults by examining those broken invariant relationships and their related metrics, since system faults usually propagate among the monitoring data and eventually lead to some broken invariant relationships. However, at one time, there are usually a lot of broken links (invariant relationships) within an invariant network. Without proper guidance, it is difficult for system experts to manually inspect this large number of broken links. To this end, in this article, we propose the problem of ranking metrics according to the anomaly levels for a given invariant network, while this is a nontrivial task due to the uncertainties and the complex nature of invariant networks. Specifically, we propose two types of algorithms for ranking metric anomaly by link analysis in invariant networks. Along this line, we first define two measurements to quantify the anomaly level of each metric, and introduce the mRank algorithm. Also, we provide a weighted score mechanism and develop the gRank algorithm, which involves an iterative process to obtain a score to measure the anomaly levels. In addition, some extended algorithms based on mRank and gRank algorithms are developed by taking into account the probability of being broken as well as noisy links. Finally, we validate all the proposed algorithms on a large number of real-world and synthetic data sets to illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of different algorithms.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2014.0

Our dataset (NPS dataset) contains answers to a set of queries (called questionnaire) sent to a randomly chosen groups of customers. It covers 34 companies called clients. The purpose of the questionnaire is to check customer satisfaction in using services of these companies which have repair shops all involved in a similar type of business (fixing heavy equipment). These shops are located in 29 states in the US and Canada. Some of the companies have their shops located in more than one state. They can compete with each other only if they target the same group of customers. The performance of a company is evaluated using the Net Promoter System (NPS). For that purpose, the data from the completed questionnaires are stored in NPS datasets. We have 34 such datasets, one for each company. Knowledge extracted from them, especially action rules and their triggers, can be used to build recommender systems giving hints to companies how to improve their NPS ratings. Larger the datasets, our believe in the knowledge extracted from them is higher. We introduce the concept of semantic similarity between companies. More semantically similar the companies are, the knowledge extracted from their joined NPS datasets has higher accuracy and coverage. Our hierarchically structured recommender system is a collection of recommender systems organized as a tree.

RBF methods express functions as a linear combination of spherically symmetric basis functions on an arbitrary set of nodes. The Finite-Difference component expresses this combination over a local set of nodes neighboring the point where the derivative is sought. The derivative at all points takes the form of a sparse matrix/vector multiplication (SpMV). In this paper, we consider the case of local stencils with a fixed number of nodes at each point and encode the sparse matrix in ELLPACK format. We increase the number of operations relative to memory bandwidth by interleaving the calculation of four derivatives of four different functions, or 16 different derivatives. We demonstrate a novel implementation on the Intel MIC architecture, taking into account its advanced swizzling and channel interchange features. We present benchmarks on a real data set that show an almost sevenfold in- crease in speed compared to efficient implementations of a single derivative, reaching a performance of almost 140 Gflop/s in single precision.

A firm can offer items or links that are targeted for immediate sales based on what is already known about a customer's profile. Alternatively, the firm can offer items directed at learning a customer's preferences. This, in turn, can help the firm make improved recommendations for the remainder of the engagement period with the customer. An important decision problem faced by a profit maximizing firm is what proportion of the offer set should be targeted toward immediate sales and what proportion toward learning the customer's profile. We study the problem as an optimal control model, and characterize the solution. Our findings can help firms decide how to vary the size and composition of the offer set during the course of a customer's engagement period with the firm. The benefits of the proposed approach are illustrated for different patterns of engagement, including the length of the engagement period, uncertainty in the length of the period, and the frequency of the customer's visits to the firm. We also study the scenario where the firm optimizes the size of the offer set during the planning horizon.

2-s2.0-84904065828,Article,"Technological advances in medicine allow health care providers to diagnose diseases earlier, diminish suffering, and prolong life. These advances, although widely revered for changing the face of cancer care, come at a cost for patients, families, and even health care providers. One widely cited consequence of better diagnostics and improved treatment regiments is the sense that there is always one more test or therapy available to extend life. Such an approach to cancer care can prove detrimental to patients' healing. In addition, these new tests and treatments further focus attention on the body as the site of healing and cure while downplaying other aspects of health. The absence of psychological, social, and spiritual care from a patient's cancer care plan compromises healing and makes palliative and end of life care more complicated. In this essay, I discuss the tensions that exist between contemporary cancer care and spirituality and use Communication Studies scholarship to navigate the challenges of integrating a patient's religious or spiritual beliefs into their cancer treatment and care. In addition to discussing the challenges of communicating about sensitive topics such as illness, spirituality, and dying, this article uses narrative examples from a comprehensive cancer center and a hospice (both in the United States) to understand how people with cancer and other terminal illnesses communicate their spirituality and how these conversations influence health care choices and provide comfort. By understanding how patients communicate about topics such as the meaning of life, quality of life, dying and death, providers are better equipped to offer care that is consistent with a patient's beliefs and life goals. This approach maintains that communication is more than a means of transferring information, but is constitutive. By understanding that communication creates our lives and shapes our worlds, lay and professional caregivers can meet patients where they are spiritually, emotionally, and socially and offer effective care that is culturally situated. For many in Muslim societies, a cancer diagnosis is Divine fate. Understanding a cancer diagnosis as destiny offers comfort to some, yet cancer patients and their family members may experience isolation because of the stigmas associated with the disease. This double-bind can lead to spiritual or existential crises, which draws further attention to the need for effective spiritual care that ultimately fosters patient and family healing whether or not a cure is possible. Bringing together various approaches to communicating about diverse spiritual and religious ideas may allow for enhanced comprehensive cancer care.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Communication Studies,2010.0

In this paper, we study the problem of placing overlay networks onto the substrate in a way that makes it easier to detect and localize faults, in other words, improves their diagnosability. Overlay network fault diagnosis is especially challenging because of their construction as virtual networks on top of a network substrate. We give a practical definition of diagnosability, and develop an overlay assignment algorithm that aims to optimize overlay placement for the ease and quickness of fault diagnosis. We evaluate the efficiency of this algorithm using an existing passive fault diagnosis scheme, and show that we are able to improve diagnosability without placing a significant strain on the network.

Their efforts to ""hold on"" challenge recent trends in the anthropological study of kinship, specifically deconstructions of the importance of things-such as pregnancy-that appear biological. I argue that both criticisms and defenses of kinship as biology have overlooked how the physical process of reproduction creates interactional constraints on negotiations for children.

After studying a Chinese municipal government's microblogs (weibo) in depth from the perspective of local governance, we find that official microblogs do not in the short run lead to organizational change. Instead, Chinese local government microblogs function largely as 'beta-institutions' experimenting with ways to interact and negotiate with their microblog publics and microblog service providers and aimed at improving social management and political legitimacy.

For example, smart metering data could reveal highly accurate real-time home appliance energy load, which may be used to infer the human activities inside the houses. One effective way to hide actual appliance loads from the outsiders is Battery-based Load Hiding (BLH), in which a battery is installed for each household and smartly controlled to store and supply power to the appliances. Even though such technique has been demonstrated useful and can prevent certain types of attacks, none of existing BLH works can provide probably privacy-preserving mechanisms. In this paper, we investigate the privacy of smart meters via differential privacy. We first analyze the current existing BLH methods and show that they cannot guarantee differential privacy in the BLH problem. We then propose a novel randomized BLH algorithm which successfully assures differential privacy, and further propose the Multitasking-BLH-Exp3 algorithm which adaptively updates the BLH algorithm based on the context and the constraints.

However, recent works have shown that the widely used weighted least square based state estimation is vulnerable to stealthy attacks wherein an adversary can alter certain measurements to corrupt the estimator's solution, yet remain undetected by the estimator's bad data detection algorithm. Here, we show that an attack on state estimation can compromise the integrity of OPF and undermine the economic and secure system operation.

However, a high level of occlusion along with similarity in appearance and motion can cause the tracking to drift to an incorrect ant. In this paper, we reduce drifting by using occlusion to identify incorrect ants and prevent the tracking from drifting to them. The key idea is that a set of ants enter occlusion, move through occlusion then exit occlusion. We do not attempt to track through occlusions but simply find a set of objects that enters and exits them. Knowing that tracking must stay within a set of ants exiting a given occlusion, we reduce drifting by preventing tracking to ants outside the occlusion.

Between 1988 and today, the overall structure has grown to total 19 different branches. We briefly describe each branch, identifying over 200 resources for the further study of these branches. Research implications Although the various branches share key concepts and processes, they have been developed by different researchers, in a variety of settings from laboratories to schools to business organizations. Second, we outline some important issues for further research in some of the branches. Third, we emphasize the value of developing new research methods for testing and applying the theories. Practical implications These theories have been used to explain phenomena of gender, racial, and ethnic inequality among others, and for understanding some cases of personality attributions, deviance and control processes, and application of double standards in hiring. Social implications Status and expectation state processes often operate to produce invidious social inequalities. Understanding these processes can enable social scientists to devise more effective interventions to reduce these inequalities. Originality/value of the chapter Status and expectation state processes occupy a significant segment of research into group processes. This chapter provides an authoritative overview of ideas in the program, what is known, and what remains to be discovered.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Sociology,2014.0

However, the manual analysis of these videos is tedious and time consuming. Automated tracking methods tend to drift due to frequent occlusions during their interactions and similarity in appearance. Semi-automated tracking methods enable corrections of tracking errors by incorporating user interaction. Although it is much lower than manual analysis, the required user time of the existing method is still typically 23 times the actual video length. In this paper, we propose a new semi-automated method that achieves similar accuracy while reducing the user interaction time by (1) mitigating user wait time by incorporating a data association tracking method to separate the tracking from user correction, and (2) minimizing the number of candidates visualized for user during correction. This proposed method is able to reduce the user interaction time by 67% while maintaining the accuracy within 3% of the previous semi-automated method [11].",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2014.0

Two trillion dollars is roughly equal to the gnp of China and Canada combined. The number also approximates the total accumulation of bank assets in Charlotte, a metro area of 1.6 million. It is no exaggeration to say that a small group of executives in downtown Charlotte controls assets equal to one-fifth of U.S. annual economic output. While the rise of banking in Charlotte has been well documented, 1 no one has explored the degree to which the industry connects Charlotte to the broader world. This chapter surveys the creation and evolution of Charlotte's most influential industry and the blend of local culture with the demands of the global economy. The historical and cultural foundations of Charlotte's current global integration also garner closer examination. Charlotte's volume of financial assets is noteworthy on its own, but when contextualized in the historic poverty, cultural conservatism, and once-backward image of the region, this accumulation of wealth represents one of the most dramatic economic achievements in our nation's history. The recent rise of Charlotte's globally significant financial center is, in part, a product of a long history of Charlotte industrialists recognizing the value of developing connections beyond their own region. It can be argued that the city's bankers, surrounded by the extreme poverty of nineteenth-and twentieth-century southern Piedmont, felt the necessity of expansion more than any other business. However, the desire to expand was frustrated first by limits of technology and later by federal regulation. Only since the mid-1980s have Charlotte bankers been free to expand their business beyond the state's borders.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2010.0

While, at first glance, the present-day pattern of African American neighborhoods of southern cities such as Charlotte resembles that of their northern counterparts, beneath the surface lies a rich historical diversity. In this chapter we contend that the longer history of African American residential experience in southern cities offers a fertile research opportunity to understand how such communities are affected by the efforts of cities to position themselves within the developing global economy. Cities such as Charlotte provide a rich laboratory for exploring diversity in the residential experiences of African Americans in urban America. Our investigation in Charlotte suggests that the African American residential experience is not as one-dimensional as is often depicted in the literature. In fact, Charlotte offers a range of residential types, and we have developed a typology of African American residential areas based primarily on the timing of their initial development. We propose a typology of five African American residential types: In-Town Residential Concentrations, Rural Villages and Concentrations, Separate Villages (Rim Villages and Streetcar Suburbs), and more recent, Auto-Oriented Suburbs. All of these types saw their genesis during the period from immediately after the end of the Civil War until about 1920. In Charlotte black suburbs did not emerge until the late 1890s and early 1900s. However, all five neighborhood types underwent significant changes in spatial form and character as Charlotte and most of North Carolina experienced its own brand of economic (industrial) development around the turn of the centur y.

Frequently it offers a way in which businesses and their leadership can ""give back"" to the community ""in which they reside or maintain offices"" and do so in a manner that enhances their own interests and image.2 In the context of contemporary globalization, the scope and breadth of corporate citizenship reflects the multinational scale at which many corporations now work. Corporate citizenship may also influence the character and fortune of the cities in which businesses are headquartered. A symbiotic relationship can exist between a corporation and its hometown or headquarters community, particularly if a company has been a constant and active presence for a significant number of years. A corporation's loyalty to its community and vice versa can create an entrenched dynamic that helps define the essence of a city and shape its built environment. Furthermore, such a dynamic can manifest itself in specific revitalization initiatives grounded in corporate commitment to local place but contextual-ized by global ambition. This chapter explores the process of neighborhood revitalization through the lens of corporate citizenship and focuses on the experience of Charlotte's Fourth Ward as an illustration of how corporate-led, neighborhood-based revitalization successfully achieved the goals of ""improving life for others while at the same time improving life for oneself."" Drawing from a range of local and census-derived data, archival resources, and key informant interviews, we tell the story of how, beginning in the early 1970s, North Carolina National Bank (ncnb) provided conceptual and financial leadership to a process of gentrification in the blighted Fourth Ward. The transformation of the ward into a vibrant, center-city neighborhood provided an initiating mechanism through which the bank provided sustained leadership to a range of public-private partnerships that facilitated not only the ward's revitalization but eventually that of the entire Center City. Gentrification of the historic Fourth Ward ensured the existence of an upwardly mobile, pedestrian-scale neighborhood in close proximity to corporate headquarters. Such aesthetic, economic, and geographic characteristics were viewed as essential to attracting globally competitive financial service workers to the city and to the employment rolls of the ascendant corporations headquartered there. We begin the chapter with a discussion of the evolution of corporate citizenship and public-private partnership in American cities, then document and assess the specific case of revitalization in Charlotte's Fourth Ward. Our discussion focuses on how the visionary leadership and corporate citizenship of ncnb (now Bank of America) initiated a process of neighborhood-based revitalization that became the first piece in the overall redefinition and restructuring of Charlotte's Center City. We also highlight the way in which Charlotte's case is perhaps unique, given the ambitions of the bank and their tangible expression in the process of revitalization.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2010.0

The place-defining continuity inherent in renewed functions for old mills wraps a sense of heritage, place, and community into new economic and social environments. Furthermore, mill reuse creates a mutually supportive intersection for diverse interests including developers, preservationists, and municipal and regional governments whose initiatives focus on economic revitalization to restore sagging tax bases and revitalize blighted industrial landscapes and neighborhoods. More recently, ""smart growth"" advocates who promote ""green"" planning processes that yield sustainable, vibrant communities have been added to the list. From their multiple motivations for preservation and for successful business ventures, these groups realize that old buildings' sense of place and architectural character provide amenities that draw people back to once-blighted, empty urban spaces.1 The places that Charlotte's old mills find in a new economy represent more than innovative business ventures and public sector initiatives. They evocatively reveal the layers of past geographies and economies that have shaped the city's transition toward becoming a global city. In their initial development and in their reuse, Charlotte's textile mills are emblematic of stages that first defined the city as a center in the industrial transformation of a rural agrarian South and, in their recent reuse, redefined the city's textile heritage in a maturing postindustrial urban landscape. This chapter provides a spatial perspective on that process of change. Key elements of Charlotte's path in the process involve the ways the city first adopted a textile economy and later made adjustments in embracing the heritage of its early economic landscape. Data for that analysis are derived from histories of the southern textile industry; the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Historic Landmarks Commission and the City of Charlotte Planning Commission; historic maps of Charlotte; fieldwork and interviews related to our previous research on the topic; and a content analysis of local news articles on the textile industry and the reuse of mills. We begin this chapter with details of the southern textile mill expansion and the ways that it was significant to Charlotte's emergence as an urban place within an economy in transition. That nineteenth-century coverage is followed by a discussion of Charlotte's contemporary potentials and challenges for mill reuse in its varied forms. Finally, we discuss the city's individual postindustrial reuse projects with an emphasis on place-specific attributes of mills that made some of them catalysts for nearby redevelopment and made others candidates for reuse by virtue of redevelopment initiatives already taking place around their sites. Charlotte's mill reuse is significant: it offers a case study of how solutions can be created as old city-forming industrial corridors become dormant, neglected landscapes in the wake of a postindustrial hollowing out of central cities that take jobs and people into the suburbs.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2010.0

The goal of the Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) surgery is the permanent precise placement of the stimulating electrode within target nucleus. As this structure poorly discriminates in CT or MRI it is usually stereotactically located using microelectrode recording. Several microelectrodes are parallelly inserted into the brain and in measured steps they are advanced towards expected location of the nucleus. At each step, from 20 mm above the target, the neuronal activity is recorded. Because STN has a distinct physiology, the signals recorded within it also present specific features. By extracting certain features from recordings provided by the microelectrodes, it is possible to construct a classifier that provides useful discrimination. This discrimination divides the recordings into two classes, i.e. those registered within the STN and those registered outside of it.

It is generally believed that cell fate specification in C. elegans is mainly mediated by lineage-based mechanisms, where the specification paths are driven forward by a succession of asymmetric cell divisions. However, little is known about how each binary decision is made by gene regulatory programs. In this study, we endeavor to obtain a global understanding of cell lineage/fate divergence processes during the early embryogenesis of C. elegans. We reanalyzed the EPIC data set, which traced the expression level of reporter genes at single-cell resolution on a nearly continuous time scale up to the 350-cell stage in C. elegans embryos. We examined the expression patterns for a total of 131 genes from 287 embryos with high quality image recordings, among which 86 genes have replicate embryos. Our results reveal that during early embryogenesis, divergence between sister lineages could be largely explained by a few genes. We predicted genes driving lineage divergence and explored their expression patterns in sister lineages. Moreover, we found that divisions leading to fate divergence are associated with a large number of genes being differentially expressed between sister lineages. Interestingly, we found that the developmental paths of lineages could be differentiated by a small set of genes. Therefore, our results support the notion that the cell fate patterns in C. elegans are achieved through stepwise binary decisions punctuated by cell divisions.

The work will facilitate genetic and evolutionary studies inBrassicaceae. A broccoli population, VI-158 × BNC, consisting of 150 F2:3 families was used to create a saturated Brassica oleracea (diploid: CC) linkage map using a recently developed rapeseed (Brassica napus) (tetraploid: AACC) Illumina Infinium single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array. The map consisted of 547 non-redundant SNP markers spanning 948.1 cM across nine chromosomes with an average interval size of 1.7 cM. As the SNPs are anchored to the genomic reference sequence of the rapid cycling B. oleracea TO1000, we were able to estimate that the map provides 96 % coverage of the diploid genome. Carotenoid analysis of 2 years data identified 3 QTLs on two chromosomes that are associated with up to half of the phenotypic variation associated with the accumulation of total or individual compounds. By searching the genome sequences of the two related diploid species (B. oleracea and B. rapa), we further identified putative carotenoid candidate genes in the region of these QTLs. This is the first description of the use of a B. napus SNP array to rapidly construct high-density genetic linkage maps of one of the constituent diploid species. The unambiguous nature of these markers with regard to genomic sequences provides evidence to the nature of genes underlying the QTL, and demonstrates the value and impact this resource will have on Brassica research.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2014.0

2-s2.0-84906046474,Article,"In this interview, Dr. Arnie Cann discusses his research and views on the ubiquitous role of humor in psychological health and well-being. The interview begins with Professor Cann recounting how he originally became interested in studying humor. He then reflects on the main findings associated with the wide variety of humor-related studies he has conducted over the years. In doing so, Dr. Cann provides suggestions and ideas for further research investigating the role of humor in health and well-being. Specific topic areas discussed include the use of humor in the workplace and other social domains, personality approaches to humor, humor and interpersonal processes, humor and psychopathology, and humor's role in dealing with stress and well-being. One of the prominent themes in this interview is the clear recognition of sense of humor as a multi-dimensional construct that includes various components that may either be beneficial or detrimental to well-being. A further important theme is the major distinction between humor as an inherent personality construct versus humor that results from exposure to stimuli (e.g., a comedy film). Comments are also provided by Dr. Cann on how the positive affect stemming from humor may be of particular benefit to the individual. Also discussed is the recent move to more fully integrate contemporary humor research with positive psychology approaches. The interview concludes with Dr. Cann providing several recommendations regarding future theorizing and research on the role of humor in psychological well-being.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Psychology,2014.0
2-s2.0-84906048106,Article,"A good sense of humor has been implicated as a quality that could contribute to psychological well-being. The mechanisms through which sense of humor might operate include helping to reappraise threats, serving as a character strength, or facilitating happiness. The current research attempts to integrate these possibilities by examining whether a good sense of humor might operate globally by helping to maintain a more stable positive affect. Stable positive affect has been shown to facilitate more effective problem solving and to build resilience. However, not all humor is adaptive humor, so we also examine the roles that different styles of humor use might play. Individual differences in humor styles were used to predict stable levels of affect. Then, in a longitudinal design, humor styles and stable affect were used to predict subsequent resilience and psychological health. The results indicated that stable affect was related to resilience and psychological well-being, and that a sense of humor that involves self-enhancing humor, humor based on maintaining a humorous perspective about one's experiences, was positively related to stable positive affect, negatively related to stable negative affect, and was mediated through stable affect in influencing resilience, well-being and distress. Thus, while a good sense of humor can lead to greater resilience and better psychological health, the current results, focusing on stable affect, find only self-enhancing humor provides reliable benefits.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Psychology,2014.0

Methods: This longitudinal prospective cohort study recruited participants (n= 185) from several clinics in Charlotte, NC. Body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) were used as measures of body size and sexual intercourse frequency was determined from self-reported information provided on daily diaries. Mean monthly frequencies of sexual intercourse were calculated and linear mixed models were used to assess if means remained constant over time. Generalized estimating equations were used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Mean monthly frequency of sexual intercourse was similar for women classified as normal or underweight or obese by BMI during each month of data collection but was highest for women classified as overweight. After adjustment, obesity-sexual intercourse associations were attenuated (BMI ≥30 vs. <25.0: OR= 0.78; 95% CI, 0.43-1.42 and WHR ≥ 0.85 vs. <0.85: OR= 1.11; 95% CI, 0.62-2.01).

Thus, they challenged the dominant achievement paradigm and created their own sense of school success, which included social dimensions such as community involvement and personal growth and development. Although collectively the students concluded that standardized exams and grades were not achievement or accurate measures of achievement, yet they clearly knew how to 'play the game.' While students must meet the norms of standardized measures and end-of-course testing related to the Common Core, schools can respond to their diverse assessment needs by incorporating broader measures that include, but are not limited to standardized tests.

The present study attempts to debunk, confirm, or alter the popular perception that young adults are administering alcohol in novel ways. Methods: A self-report paper survey was administered to 2349 young adults selected for inclusion using a stratified random sampling technique. Respondents were asked to indicate all of the ways in which they had administered alcohol and presented options ranging from traditional oral consumption from a cup, can, or bottle to innovative techniques referenced by medical reports and news outlets. The prevalence of each form of innovative use was reported and explored. Results: Innovative alcohol use was very rare in the sample. Only 25 of 2349 participants (1.1%) had engaged in one or more of the creative methods of alcohol consumption. Among these individuals, most reported either using an AWOL device and/or administering alcohol anally. Vaginal administration and ""eyeballing"" were only reported by three and one respondents, respectively. Conclusions: It appears that innovative alcohol use is more than an urban legend but that innovative use, even among a population with high rates of alcohol and drug use, is rare.

In this work, we show how centrality computations can be regularized to reach higher performance. For betweenness centrality, we deviate from the traditional fine-grain approach by allowing a GPU to execute multiple BFSs at the same time. Furthermore, we exploit hardware and software vectorization to compute closeness centrality values on CPUs, GPUs and Intel Xeon Phi.

However, it is easy to construct natural functions that are considered as GOOD pseudorandom generators by the NIST SP800-22 test suite though the output of these functions is easily distinguishable from the uniform distribution. This paper proposes solutions to address this challenge by using statistical distance based testing techniques. We carried out both NIST tests and LIL based tests on the following pseudorandom generators by generating more than 200TB of data in total: (1) the standard C linear congruential generator, (2) Mersenne Twister pseudorandom generator, (3) PHP random generators (including Mersenne Twister and Linear Congruential based), and (4) Debian Linux (CVE-2008-0166) pseudorandom generator with OpenSSL 0.9.8c-1. As a first important result, our experiments show that, PHP pseudorandom generator implementation (both linear congruential generators and Mersenne Twister generators) outputs completely insecure bits if the output is not further processed. As a second result, we illustrate the advantages of our LIL based testing over NIST testing. It is known that Debian Linux (CVE-2008-0166) pseudorandom generator based on OpenSSL 0.9.8c-1 is flawed and the output sequences are predictable. Our LIL tests on these sequences discovered the flaws in Debian Linux implementation. However, NIST SP800-22 test suite is not able to detect this flaw using the NIST recommended parameters. It is concluded that NIST SP800-22 test suite is not sufficient and distance based LIL test techniques be included in statistical testing practice. It is also recommended that all pseudorandom generator implementations be comprehensively tested using state-of-the-art statistically robust testing tools.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2014.0

Seventeen patients with knee OA and 20 healthy controls completed testing. Motor evoked potentials were measured at the quadriceps by superficial electromyographic recordings. Corticospinal excitability was assessed by measuring resting motor threshold (RMT) to TMS stimulation of the quadriceps representation at primary motor cortex, and intracortical excitability was assessed via paired-pulse paradigms for short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF). No statistically significant differences between patients with knee OA and healthy controls were found for RMT, SICI or ICF measures (p > 0.05). For patients with knee OA, there were significant associations observed between pain and RMT, as well as between pain and ICF.

This paper proposes an automatic recognition system for non-manual grammatical markers in American Sign Language (ASL) based on a multi-scale, spatio-temporal analysis of head pose and facial expressions. The analysis takes account of gestural components of these markers, such as raised or lowered eyebrows and different types of periodic head movements. To advance the state of the art in non-manual grammatical marker recognition, we propose a novel multi-scale learning approach that exploits spatio-temporally low-level and high-level facial features. Low-level features are based on information about facial geometry and appearance, as well as head pose, and are obtained through accurate 3D deformable model-based face tracking. High-level features are based on the identification of gestural events, of varying duration, that constitute the components of linguistic non-manual markers. Specifically, we recognize events such as raised and lowered eyebrows, head nods, and head shakes. We also partition these events into temporal phases. We separate the anticipatory transitional movement (the onset) from the linguistically significant portion of the event, and we further separate the core of the event from the transitional movement that occurs as the articulators return to the neutral position towards the end of the event (the offset). This partitioning is essential for the temporally accurate localization of the grammatical markers, which could not be achieved at this level of precision with previous computer vision methods. In addition, we analyze and use the motion patterns of these non-manual events. Those patterns, together with the information about the type of event and its temporal phases, are defined as the high-level features. Using this multi-scale, spatio-temporal combination of low- and high-level features, we employ learning methods for accurate recognition of non-manual grammatical markers in ASL sentences.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2014.0

It shows that, unlike previous generations, most Blacks in France are born in France and share common sociopolitical and cultural reference points. As a result, this Black French population deploys new Black Nationalist expressions advocating that Blackness is an integral part of the French nation and that Black citizens are entitled to the same opportunities as Whites. Subversively, people of African descent are inserting Blackness into a supposedly color-blind nation. In contrast to France, the African Diaspora in the USA is increasingly diverse. But due to the misrepresentation of African-American identities and cultural differences, many Black migrants seek to distance themselves from African Americans, a relationship that ironically mirrors intra-Black relations in France of the 1960s and 1970s. Like France, however, demographic change within the Black population in the USA has also reconfigured the parameters of Black Nationalism. I contend that Black Nationalism in the USA is increasingly transnational in character.

No study to similarly describe the patterns of relative surgical complexity among a population of United States (U.S) civilian hospitals has been completed. Methods. Design: single year, retrospective, cross-sectional. Setting/Participants: the study used Florida Inpatient Discharge Data from short-term acute hospitals for calendar year 2009. Two hundred hospitals with 2,542,920 discharges were organized into four quartiles (Q 1, 2, 3, 4) based on the number of complex procedures per hospital. The VHA surgical complexity matrix was applied to assign relative complexity to each procedure. The Clinical Classification Software (CCS) system assigned complex procedures to clinically meaningful groups. For outcome comparisons, propensity score matching methods adjusted for the surgical procedure, age, gender, race, comorbidities, mechanical ventilator use and type of admission. Main Outcome Measures: in-hospital mortality and length-of-stay (LOS). Results: Only 5.2% of all inpatient discharges involve a complex procedure. The highest volume complex procedure hospitals (Q4) have 49.8% of all discharges but 70.1% of all complex procedures. In the 133,436 discharges with a primary complex procedure, 374 separate specific procedures are identified, only about one third of which are performed in the lowest volume complex procedure (Q1) hospitals. Complex operations of the digestive, respiratory, integumentary and musculoskeletal systems are the least concentrated and proportionately more likely to occur in the lower volume hospitals. Operations of the cardiovascular system and certain technology dependent miscellaneous diagnostic and therapeutic procedures are the most concentrated in high volume hospitals. Organ transplants are only done in Q4 hospitals. There were no significant differences in in-hospital mortality rates and the longest lengths of stay were found in higher volume hospitals.

Since 2004 artemether-lumefantrine has served to treat uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. However, increasing reports on delayed parasite clearance to artemisinin opens up a new challenge in anti-malarial therapy. With the complete withdrawal of CQ for the treatment of Plasmodium falciparum malaria, this study assessed the evolution of CQ resistance by investigating the prevalence of mutant alleles in the pfmdr1 and pfcrt genes in P. falciparum and pvmdr1 gene in Plasmodium vivax in Southern and Eastern Ethiopia. Methods. Of the 1,416 febrile patients attending primary health facilities in Southern Ethiopia, 329 febrile patients positive for P. falciparum or P. vivax were recruited. Similarly of the 1,304 febrile patients from Eastern Ethiopia, 81 febrile patients positive for P. falciparum or P. vivax were included in the study. Of the 410 finger prick blood samples collected from malaria patients, we used direct sequencing to investigate the prevalence of mutations in pfcrt and pfmdr1. This included determining the gene copy number in pfmdr1 in 195 P. falciparum clinical isolates, and mutations in the pvmdr1 locus in 215 P. vivax clinical isolates. Results: The pfcrt K76 CQ-sensitive allele was observed in 84.1% of the investigated P.falciparum clinical isolates. The pfcrt double mutations (K76T and C72S) were observed less than 3%. The pfcrt SVMNT haplotype was also found to be present in clinical isolates from Ethiopia. The pfcrt CVMNK-sensitive haplotypes were frequently observed (95.9%). The pfmdr1 mutation N86Y was observed only in 14.9% compared to 85.1% of the clinical isolates that carried sensitive alleles. Also, the sensitive pfmdr1 Y184 allele was more common, in 94.9% of clinical isolates. None of the investigated P. falciparum clinical isolates carried S1034C, N1042D and D1246Y pfmdr1 polymorphisms. All investigated P. falciparum clinical isolates from Southern and Eastern Ethiopia carried only a single copy of the mutant pfmdr1 gene.

Recent progress in active learning can alleviate this issue, leading to a great reduction on the labeling cost without sacrificing the predicting accuracy too much. However, most existing active learning methods disregard the ""structured information"" that may exist in medical images (e.g., data from individual patients), and make a simplifying assumption that unlabeled data is independently and identically distributed. Both may not be suitable for real-world medical images. In this paper, we propose a novel batch-mode active learning method which explores and leverages such structured information in annotations of medical images to enforce diversity among the selected data, therefore maximizing the information gain.

2-s2.0-84906990955,Conference Paper,"With a continuous growing amount of annotated histopathological images, large-scale and data-driven methods potentially provide the promise of bridging the semantic gap between these images and their diagnoses. The purpose of this paper is to increase the scale at which automated systems can entail scalable analysis of histopathological images in massive databases. Specifically, we propose a principled framework to unify hashing-based image retrieval and supervised learning. Concretely, composite hashing is designed to simultaneously fuse and compress multiple high-dimensional image features into tens of binary hash bits, enabling scalable image retrieval with a very low computational cost. Upon a local data subset that retains the retrieved images, supervised learning methods are applied on-the-fly to model image structures for accurate classification. Our framework is validated thoroughly on 1120 lung microscopic tissue images by differentiating adenocarcinoma and squamous carcinoma. The average accuracy is 87.5% with only 17ms running time, which compares favorably with other commonly used methods.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2014.0
2-s2.0-84906993272,Conference Paper,"Recent advances in Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs) allow delivering packets among mobile devices via opportunistic communications during intermittent contacts. However, the lack of rich contact opportunities still causes poor delivery ratio and long delay of DTN routing, especially for large-scale networks. Deployment of additional stationary throwboxes can create a greater number of contact opportunities, thus improve the performance of DTN routing. However, the locations of deployed throwboxes are critical to such improvement. In this paper, we investigate where to deploy throwboxes in a large-scale throwbox-assisted DTN. By leveraging the social properties discovered from real-life tracing data, we propose a set of social-based throwbox placement algorithms which smartly pick the location of each throwbox. Extensive simulations are conducted with a real-life wireless tracing dataset and a wide range of existing DTN routing methods. The results confirm the efficiency of the proposed methods.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2014.0

In this paper, we consider the optimization problem, minimum cost localization problem in a 3D ocean sensor network, which aims to localize all underwater sensors using the minimum number of anchor nodes or the minimum travel distance of the ship which deploys and measures the anchors. Given the hardness of 3D localization, we propose a set of greedy methods to pick the anchor set and its visiting sequence.

2-s2.0-84907020152,Conference Paper,"It is traditionally a challenge for home buyers to understand, compare and contrast the investment values of real estates. While a number of estate appraisal methods have been developed to value real property, the performances of these methods have been limited by the traditional data sources for estate appraisal. However, with the development of new ways of collecting estate-related mobile data, there is a potential to leverage geographic dependencies of estates for enhancing estate appraisal. Indeed, the geographic dependencies of the value of an estate can be from the characteristics of its own neighborhood (individual), the values of its nearby estates (peer), and the prosperity of the affiliated latent business area (zone). To this end, in this paper, we propose a geographic method, named ClusRanking, for estate appraisal by leveraging the mutual enforcement of ranking and clustering power. ClusRanking is able to exploit geographic individual, peer, and zone dependencies in a probabilistic ranking model. Specifically, we first extract the geographic utility of estates from geography data, estimate the neighborhood popularity of estates by mining taxicab trajectory data, and model the influence of latent business areas via ClusRanking. Also, we use a linear model to fuse these three influential factors and predict estate investment values. Moreover, we simultaneously consider individual, peer and zone dependencies, and derive an estate-specific ranking likelihood as the objective function. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation with real-world estate related data, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2014.0
2-s2.0-84907023835,Article,"Enabling accurate analysis of social network data while preserving differential privacy has been challenging since graph features such as clustering coefficient or modularity often have high sensitivity, which is different from traditional aggregate functions (e.g., count and sum) on tabular data. In this paper, we treat a graph statistics as a function f and develop a divide and conquer approach to enforce differential privacy. The basic procedure of this approach is to first decompose the target computation f into several less complex unit computations $$f_1,\ldots,f_m$$f1,…,fm connected by basic mathematical operations (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), then perturb the output of each fi with Laplace noise derived from its own sensitivity value and the distributed privacy threshold $$\epsilon_i,$$ϵi, and finally combine those perturbed fi as the perturbed output of computation f. We examine how various operations affect the accuracy of complex computations. When unit computations have large global sensitivity values, we enforce the differential privacy by calibrating noise based on the smooth sensitivity, rather than the global sensitivity. By doing this, we achieve the strict differential privacy guarantee with smaller magnitude noise. We illustrate our approach using clustering coefficient, which is a popular statistics used in social network analysis. Empirical evaluations on five real social networks and various synthetic graphs generated from three random graph models show that the developed divide and conquer approach outperforms the direct approach.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2013.0

This, in turn, delivers intelligence for real-time decision making in various fields, such as workflow management. Indeed, it is a new paradigm for workflow modeling by the knowledge discovery in location traces. To that end, in this paper, we provide a focused study of workflow modeling by the integrated analysis of indoor location traces in the hospital environment. In comparison with conventional workflow modeling based on passive workflow logs, one salient feature of our approach is that it can proactively unravel the workflow patterns hidden in the location traces, by automatically constructing the workflow states and estimating parameters describing the transition patterns of moving objects. Specifically, to determine a meaningful granularity for the model, the workflow states are first constructed as regions associated with specific healthcare activities. Then, we transform the original indoor location traces to the sequences of workflow states and model the workflow transition patterns by finite state machines. Furthermore, we leverage the correlations in the location traces between related types of medical devices to reinforce the modeling performance and enable more applications. The results show that the proposed framework can not only model the workflow patterns effectively, but also have managerial applications in workflow monitoring, auditing, and inspection of workflow compliance, which are critical in the healthcare industry.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2014.0
2-s2.0-84907029498,Conference Paper,"With the rapid prevalence of smart mobile devices, the number of mobile Apps available has exploded over the past few years. To facilitate the choice of mobile Apps, existing mobile App recommender systems typically recommend popular mobile Apps to mobile users. However, mobile Apps are highly varied and often poorly understood, particularly for their activities and functions related to privacy and security. Therefore, more and more mobile users are reluctant to adopt mobile Apps due to the risk of privacy invasion and other security concerns. To fill this crucial void, in this paper, we propose to develop a mobile App recommender system with privacy and security awareness. The design goal is to equip the recommender system with the functionality which allows to automatically detect and evaluate the security risk of mobile Apps. Then, the recommender system can provide App recommendations by considering both the Apps' popularity and the users' security preferences. Specifically, a mobile App can lead to security risk because insecure data access permissions have been implemented in this App. Therefore, we first develop the techniques to automatically detect the potential security risk for each mobile App by exploiting the requested permissions. Then, we propose a flexible approach based on modern portfolio theory for recommending Apps by striking a balance between the Apps' popularity and the users' security concerns, and build an App hash tree to efficiently recommend Apps. Finally, we evaluate our approach with extensive experiments on a large-scale data set collected from Google Play.

At present, little is known about those who attempt to deceive physicians to receive medications, and even less is known about those who successfully avoid detection and abuse-related repercussions. The goal of this study is to assess the prevalence of attempted physician deception in a general population, explore common motives, and evaluate risk factors associated with the behavior.Methods: A stratified random sampling technique was used to obtain a locally representative sample of 2349 young adults. The sample was 48.4% male, 68.9% white, 24.4% black, and 2.8% Hispanic. Selected individuals were surveyed using a self-report instrument (80.4% response rate).Results: Of the respondents, 93 (4.0%) self-reported having attempted to deceive a physician to obtain a pharmaceutical. Most of these indicated that they were at least partially motivated by their own abuse. Approximately half reported that selling a portion of the prescription was a motivating factor. Alcohol use, marijuana use, and pharmaceutical misuse each were risk factors associated with attempted deception. Although no traits were definitively linked to the behavior, attempted deception was more commonly reported by men, Hispanics, self-identified lesbian/gay/bisexual/transgender individuals, and those at the lowest and highest extremes of the income spectrum. Logistic regression models of rare events indicated that past substance use along with sexual orientation and family income were related to attempted deception when controlling for other factors.Conclusion: Results suggest that attempted physician deception may be more common than previously believed. Practicing physicians should attempt to use risk factor information presented within this study, albeit very cautiously. This study identifies general characteristics of young people who might divert medications but notes that only a small minority of any patient group will do so. Awareness should not equal bias in the treatment of these patients; instead, it should reinforce the need for careful clinical interviewing and the utilization of prescription drug monitoring programs and local law enforcement databases.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Criminal Justice and Criminology,2014.0

Previous research suggests that contraception at the time of conception can also predispose one to hypertensive disorders during pregnancy. The objective of this study was to examine the association between contraceptive use at the time of conception and hypertensive complications during pregnancy. A total of 2,395 women aged 18-45 years participated in the 2007-2009 Michigan Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System. Contraception at the time of conception was self-reported by participants and classified as barrier, nonbarrier, or non-use. Information on hypertensive disorders during pregnancy was primarily from birth certificates. Logistic regression was used to obtain odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) to model the contraception-hypertensive disorder association. After adjustment for age and race/ethnicity, there was no strong association between use of barrier contraception at the time of conception and hypertensive disorders during pregnancy as compared to non-users (OR 1.09, 95 % CI 0.62-1.92). After adjustment for the same variables, nonbarrier users had 1.22 times the odds of experiencing hypertensive disorders during pregnancy as compared to non-users (95 % CI 0.75-1.98).

To address this disadvantage, in this paper, social-based measures to transport exclusion from a media perspective are explored. The objective is to analyze the content of a transport-related blog initiated by a local newspaper in the city of Cali, Colombia to determine if any potential indicators of social exclusion can be gleaned from this source. A two-step content analysis is performed on the entries to determine if indicators are present that may be a current source of exclusion, or that may potentially cause individuals to exclude themselves from the system. Findings reveal that bloggers made reference to geographic, time, and fear-based exclusionary dimensions, as well as personal and societal. Such a forum thus holds the potential to inform policy makers of enhancements that can be made to the system that help make it more socially inclusive.

However, it is unclear whether cancer is promoted by inflammation-induced expansion of E. coli and/or changes in expression of specific microbial genes. Here we use longitudinal (2, 12 and 20 weeks) 16S rRNA sequencing of luminal microbiota from ex-germ-free mice to show that inflamed Il10-/- mice maintain a higher abundance of Enterobacteriaceae than healthy wild-type mice. Experiments with mono-colonized Il10-/- mice reveal that host inflammation is necessary for E. coli cancer-promoting activity. RNA-sequence analysis indicates significant changes in E. coli gene catalogue in Il10-/- mice, with changes mostly driven by adaptation to the intestinal environment. Expression of specific genes present in the tumour-promoting E. coli pks island are modulated by inflammation/CRC development.

The OPF relies on the outputs of two other modules, namely topology processor and state estimator. The topology processor maps the grid topology based on statuses received from the switches and circuit breakers across the system. The state estimator computes the system state, i.e., voltage magnitudes with phase angles, transmission line flows, and system loads based on real-time meter measurements. However, topology statuses and meter measurements are vulnerable to false data injection attacks. Recent research has shown that such cyber attacks can be launched against state estimation where adversaries can corrupt the states but still remain undetected. In this paper, we show how the stealthy topology poisoning attacks can compromise the integrity of OPF, and thus undermine economic operation.

Statistical regression based on linear or simple non-linear assumptions is typically used to link post-fire forest reflectance with the degree of burn severity. However, this linkage becomes complicated if forests experienced severe mortality caused by pre-fire disease or insect outbreaks, which is likely to occur more frequently as a result of rapid climate change. In an effort to improve the understanding of the relationship between forest reflectance and fire-disease disturbances, this study explored the efficacy of three machine learning techniques, that is, Gaussian process regression (GPR), random forests (RF) and support vector regression (SVR), within a geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) framework to assess burn severity in a forest subject to pre-fire disease epidemics. MASTER [MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer)/ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer)] airborne sensor was applied to collect relatively high spatial (4 m) and high spectral (50 bands) resolution reflectance data. Results show that RF, SVR and GPR models outperformed conventional multiple regression by 48%, 29% and 27%, respectively. Compared to SVR and GPR, RF not only achieved better performance in burn severity assessment, but also demonstrated lower sensitivity to the application of different combinations of remote sensing variables.

Drawing upon one-mode network projection and three network centralities, we assess the shifting positions of individual cities and firms in the one-mode intercity and interfirm networks. Major findings include: (1) the intercity network is more stable and hierarchical than the interfirm network; (2) brokerage functions, as captured by betweenness centrality, remain highly uneven for both cities and firms. For example, New York and London's distinct positions as the world's leading producer service centres remain intact; and (3) regional and sectoral tendencies are evident in terms of growth rates of centralities.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2014.0

Peripancreatic fluid cultures may fail to identify all the infecting organisms. The aim of this study was to compare the bacterial biome of peripancreatic fluid from infected necrotizing pancreatitis patients using 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) DNA deep sequencing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) targeting the 16S rRNA gene versus standard laboratory culture.Materials and methods Peripancreatic fluid was collected during operative or radiologic intervention and samples sent for culture. In parallel, microbial DNA was extracted, qPCR targeting the 16S rRNA gene and 16S rRNA PCR amplification followed by Illumina deep sequencing were performed.Results: Using culture techniques, the bacterial strains most frequently identified were gram-negative rods (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae) and Enterococcus. Samples in which culture results were negative had copy numbers of the 16S rRNA gene close to background in qPCR analysis. For samples with high bacterial load, sequencing results were in some cases in good agreement with culture data, whereas in others there were disagreements, likely due to differences in taxonomic classification, cultivability, and differing susceptibility to background contamination. Sequencing results appeared generally unreliable in cases of negative culture where little microbial DNA was input into qPCR sequencing reactions.Conclusions: Both sequencing and culture data display their own sources of bias and potential error. Consideration of data from multiple techniques will yield a more accurate view of bacterial infections than can be achieved by any single technique.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2014.0

However, previous research has not attempted to disentangle these effects while also examining important mediators such as education level and income. Based on a sample of 4078 individuals drawn from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979, we examined the unique effects of g and parental SES on adult dietary behaviors and receipt of preventive health services. Overall, the results suggest that there is essentially little direct unique effect of cognitive ability or parental SES on adult dietary behaviors and receipt of preventive health services.

2-s2.0-84908286528,Article,"Electric power, water, natural gas and other utilities are served to consumers via functional sources such as electric power substations, pumps and pipes. Understanding the impact of service outages is vital to decision making in response and recovery efforts. Often, data pertaining to the source-sink relationships between service points and consumers is sensitive or proprietary, and is, therefore, unavailable to external entities. As a result, during emergencies, decision makers often rely on estimates of service areas produced by various methods. This paper, which focuses on electric power, assesses the accuracy of four methods for estimating power substation service areas, namely the standard and weighted versions of Thiessen polygon and cellular automata approaches. Substation locations and their power outputs are used as inputs to the service area calculation methods. Reference data is used to evaluate the accuracy in approximating a power distribution network in a mid-sized U.S. city. Service area estimation methods are surveyed and their performance is evaluated empirically. The results indicate that the performance of the approaches depends on the type of analysis employed. When the desired analysis includes aggregate economic or population predictions, the weighted version of the cellular automata approach has the best performance. However, when the desired analysis involves facility-specific predictions, the weighted Thiessen polygon approach tends to perform the best.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2014.0

We find strong evidence that hedging is associated with a lower cost of debt. The negative effect of hedging on the cost of debt is consistent across industries, and remains economically and statistically significant under various controls and econometric specifications. A cross-sectional analysis based on propensity score matching suggests that hedging initiation firms experience a drop in cost of debt, while suspension firms sustain a jump. We confirm our findings after employing an extensive array of models to address potential endogeneity. The influence of hedging on cost of debt is mainly through the lowering of bankruptcy risk and agency cost, and the reduction in information asymmetry. Finally, hedging mitigates the negative effect of rising borrowing costs on capital expenditure and firm value.",Business,Finance,2014.0

The volume of digitally available data in such emerging computing spaces presents an imminent need for search mechanisms that enable humans and applications to find relevant information within their digitally accessible physical surroundings. This paper presents Gander, a search engine for these pervasive computing spaces enabled by the IoT and characterized by large volumes of highly transient data. Gander is founded on a novel conceptual model of search that resolves queries about a user's here and now by leveraging proximally available resources in the here and now. We formally describe the model underlying Gander, describe the networking protocols that enable Gander's search, and provide a realization of Gander via an extensible framework. Employing this Gander framework, we describe a concrete middleware implementation for wirelessly networked environments. We evaluate this implementation of Gander through a user study that examines the perceived utility of myGander, a real-world mobile application enabled by the Gander middleware, and we benchmark the performance of Gander in large pervasive computing spaces through network simulation.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2014.0

We present here a descriptive summary of the experience from seven states with a history of implementing and scaling School-Wide Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (SWPBIS) over the past decade. Each state has been successful in establishing at least 500 schools using SWPBIS across approximately a third or more of the schools in their state. The implementation elements proposed by Sugai, Horner, and Lewis (2009) and the stages of implementation described by Fixsen, Naoom, Blase, Friedman, and Wallace (2005) were used within a survey with each element assessed at each stage by the SWPBIS coordinators and policy makers in the seven states. Consistent themes from analysis of the responses were defined and confirmed with the surveyed participants. Results point to four central areas of state “capacity” as being perceived as critical for a state to move SWPBIS to scale (administrative leadership and funding, local training and coaching capacity, behavioral expertise, and local evaluation capacity), and an iterative process in which initial implementation success (100–200 demonstrations) is needed to recruit the political and fiscal support required for larger scaling efforts.",Education,Educational Leadership,2014.0

We measured denitrification rates in streambed sediments seasonally at eight streams in North Carolina, USA to characterize the physicochemical drivers of nitrogen transformations in restored urban streams. Mean denitrification rates were highly variable (97±58 to 585±214μmolm-2h-1) and most significantly influenced by nitrate concentrations; baseflow nitrate concentrations ranged from 0.06 to 1.07mg/L. A multiple linear regression approach also revealed the importance of channel complexity, water depth and temperature, which together with nitrate concentrations explained 60% of the variability among sites and seasons. Controlling for nutrient limitation, we observed significantly greater denitrification rates in more geomorphically complex streams, particularly near grade control structures and in deep pools. However, these trends were not consistently observed across all sites, which suggest the added influence of watershed scale drivers (e.g., urban hydrology) as well as reach scale drivers including the design, construction and age of the restoration project.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2014.0

2-s2.0-84908687722,Article,"Although enterprise systems (ES) are ubiquitous, many firms report less than stellar payoffs from these costly investments, with underutilization often attributed to failures in the implementation process. Unfortunately, research has not provided sufficient insights into these failures, in part because it has focused on actual usage, as opposed to proficient usage, as the benchmark for successful implementation. Moreover, research has not generally examined how the adoption process unfolds over time, thus overlooking potential underlying mechanisms that may help explain how adopters achieve proficiency. To begin addressing these shortcomings, we study how adopters' pre-adoption expectations, enacted over time, can influence their post-adoption proficiency, by shaping how and why they spend time using the system during the adoption period. We analyzed time-lagged survey data from 153 financial analysts, required to adopt new ES-based software, at a multinational bank. We found that adopters who hold pre-adoption expectations reflecting greater internal and external motives to adopt the system as well as systematically integrate it into their work routines are more apt to use the system in ways that enhance their cumulative knowledge of it, and subsequently develop higher levels of proficiency post-adoption. Moreover, greater organizational support enhanced the impact of adopters' expectations on proficiency, except when their actual use is low in which case organizational support had an adverse effect.",Business,Management,2014.0

Research in this area has developed attack models, detection methods, and mitigation schemes to understand and protect against such attacks. For Collaborative Filtering RSs, model-based approaches such as item-based and matrix-factorization were found to be more robust to many types of attack. Advice in designing for system robustness has thus been to employ model-based approaches. Our recent work with the Power User Attack (PUA), however, determined that attackers disguised as influential users can successfully attack (from the attacker's viewpoint) SVD-based recommenders, as well as user-based. But item-based systems remained robust to the PUA. In this paper we investigate a new, complementary attack model, the Power Item Attack (PIA), that uses influential items to successfully attack RSs.We show that the PIA is able to impact not only user-based and SVD-based recommenders but also the heretofore highly robust item-based approach, using a novel multi-target attack vector.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2014.0

It provides an effective time-of-saliency (TOS) map where the analysts can explore a large number of transactions at different time granularities. Interesting transactions are further encoded with KnotLines, a compact visual representation that captures both the temporal variations and the contextual connection of transactions.

Purpose: This article examines the relationship between elementary teachers' perceptions of instructional autonomy, teaching context, state testing policy, and reported social studies instructional time. Research Design: Employing secondary data from the National Center for Education Statistics 2007/2008 Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS), we analyzed the association between elementary (Grades 1-5) teachers' perceived autonomy, classroom/school contexts, and state testing policies on reported time spent on social studies. We also analyzed the moderating effect of state-level testing policy on teachers' sense of autonomy in relation to reported social studies instructional time. Data Collection and Analysis: We conducted analysis of variance (ANOVA) and hierarchical liner modeling (HLM) to examine the association among multiple levels of teacher, classroom, school, and state policy levels as a function of reported social studies instructional time. Findings/Results: Results indicate that elementary teachers' working in states that require elementary social studies testing spend more time on social studies instruction. Moreover, teachers' who report greater instructional autonomy and teach intermediate grades (4-5) spend more time on social studies. Finally, elementary teachers working in states with a required social studies test report less instructional autonomy than teachers without a test.Recommendations: Findings suggest recommendations for practitioners, school leaders, and educational policy. Social studies teacher educators and practitioners should continue to support ambitious teaching. School leaders who value social studies instruction should foster environments that offer less curricular restrictions, particularly in the later grades.

In this study, we present and assess a geographic object-based image analysis (GEO-BIA) approach with high-spatial resolution imagery (SPOT 5) to map industrial disturbances using the oilsands region of Alberta's northeastern boreal forest as a case study. Key components of this study were(i) the development of additional spectral, texture, and geometrical descriptors for characterizing image-objects (groups of alike pixels) and their contextual properties, and (ii) the introduction of decision trees with boosting to perform the object-based land cover classification. Results indicate that the approach achieved an overall accuracy of 88%, and that all descriptor groups provided relevant information for the classification. Despite challenges remaining (e.g., distinguishing between spectrally similar classes,or placing discrete boundaries), the approach was able to effectively delineate and classify fine-spatial resolution industrial disturbances.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2015.0
2-s2.0-84911373235,Conference Paper,"A fundamental challenge in large-scale multiagent systems (MAS) is to enhance network-related dynamical processes such as establishing social convention in a decentralized fashion by regulating the behavior of the artificial autonomous agents. In my dissertation, I plan to study the specific problem of communication convention formation as a dynamic semiotic process over a large-scale MAS. In a semi-otic process, a group of artificial agents collectively invent and negotiate about a shared language system that is used for communication. The landscape of the communication system will be captured through a hierarchy of interdependent networks where a semiotic network is built on top of an agent network. I propose a network theoretic investigation to determine its implications on the dynamic convention formation process and plan to develop a generalized theory of communication convention suitable for large-scale networked MAS. This theory will support predictions of system properties such as convergence dynamics across different temporal regions. Finally, an effective convention formation mechanism based on the generalized theory will be presented and evaluated for a real-world application domain.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2014.0

Our central hypothesis in this paper is that no simple distributed mechanism (such as the state-of-the-art Generalized Simple Majority (GSM) rule) can achieve this. We augment the agents with ""network thinking"" capability to solve this single convention convergence problem. Topological features such as node degree is used to design the accumulated coupling strength (ACS) convention selection algorithm. However, ACS does not perform as well in random networks as GSM does. Hence we propose a topology aware convention selection (TACS) algorithm that enables the agents to predict their local neighborhood topology and then to select a suitable convention selection algorithm. We have performed an extensive simulation study on random and SF networks showing that the majority of the agents correctly recognize their topology and use the appropriate convention mechanism leading to the convergence into a single convention.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2014.0

This exploratory study examined the feasibility of using the NVS as a self-administered questionnaire (SAQ) in a low-income, primary care setting. Adult hypertensive patients were recruited in 2011-2012 (n=238). Quantitative and qualitative analyses were conducted to examine potential issues with self-administration. Patients had low rates of adequate health literacy (28.4%). Only half of respondents completed the NVS (54.4%). Being Black, female, and having additional chronic illnesses increased the likelihood of being a partial responder as opposed to being a completer. Easier math problems and reading comprehension items were attempted in greater numbers by partial responders. Results indicate issues with interpretation and the need for better scoring instructions.

This lack of information is even more profound when it comes to those older adults residing in assisted living communities. Little research evidence exists exploring how assisted living residents view brain health and what relationship exists between their brain health knowledge and other variables. This study examined brain health knowledge among residents of assisted living communities (ALCs) in North Carolina.

We used floating static gas chambers to assess diffusive fluxes of methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), and nitrous oxide (N2O) from the air-water interface of three beaver ponds (0.05-8 ha) in Rhode Island from fall 2012 to summer 2013. Gas flux was based on linear changes of gas concentrations in chambers over 1 h. Our results show that these beaver ponds generated considerable CH4 and CO2 emissions. Methane flux (18-556 mg m-2 d-1) showed no significant seasonal differences, but the shallowest pond generated significantly higher CH4 flux than the other ponds. Carbon dioxide flux (0.5-22.0 g m-2 d-1) was not significantly different between sites, but it was significantly higher in the fall, possibly due to the degradation of fresh leaves. Nitrous oxide flux was low (0-2.4 mg m-2 d-1). Overall, CH4 and CO2 comprised most of the global warming potential, 61 and 38%, respectively. The shallowness of the beaver ponds may have limited the time needed for CH4 oxidation to CO2 before CH4 escaped to the atmosphere. Beaver dams also increase the aerial extent of hydric soils, which may transform riparian areas from upland GHG sinks to wetland GHG sources thereby changing the net global warming potential. Further studies tracking the pattern and conditions of beaver pond creation and abandonment will be essential to understanding their role as GHG sources.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2014.0

2-s2.0-84912124064,Conference Paper,"State estimation plays a critically important role in ensuring the secure and reliable operation of the power grid. However, recent works have shown that the widely used weighted least squares (WLS) estimator, which uses several system wide measurements, is vulnerable to cyber attacks wherein an adversary can alter certain measurements to corrupt the estimator's solution, but evade the estimator's existing bad data detection algorithms and thus remain invisible to the system operator. Realistically, such a stealthy attack in its most general form has several constraints, particularly in terms of an adversary's knowledge and resources for achieving a desired attack outcome. In this light, we present a formal framework to systematically investigate the feasibility of stealthy attacks considering constraints of the adversary. In addition, unlike prior works, our approach allows the modeling of attacks on topology mappings, where an adversary can drastically strengthen stealthy attacks by intentionally introducing topology errors. Moreover, we show that this framework allows an operator to synthesize cost-effective countermeasures based on given resource constraints and security requirements in order to resist stealthy attacks.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the first three cohorts (. n = 42 scholars) of the RWJF NFS program. Methods: A descriptive research design was used. Data were derived from quarterly and annual reports, and a questionnaire (seven open-ended questions) was administered via Survey Monkey Inc. (Palo Alto, CA, USA). Results: During their tenure, scholars had on average six to seven articles published, were teaching/mentoring at the graduate level (93%), and holding leadership positions at their academic institutions (100%). Eleven scholars (26%) achieved fellowship in the American Academy of Nursing, one of the highest nursing honors. The average ratings on a Likert scale of 1 (not at all supportive) to 10 (extremely supportive) of whether or not RWJF had helped scholars achieve their goals in teaching, service, research, and leadership were 7.7, 8.0, 9.4, and 9.5, respectively.

2-s2.0-84914124918,"General Publications (Press, Editorials, Letters)","A continuum manipulator, such as a multisection trunk/tentacle robot, performs manipulation tasks by continuously deforming into different concave shapes. While such a robot is promising for manipulating a wide range of objects in less-structured and cluttered environments, it poses a greater challenge to collision detection than conventional, articulated manipulators. Existing collision detection algorithms are built upon intersection checking between convex primitives, such as between two convex polygons or polyhedra, with the assumption that both the manipulator and the objects in the environment are modeled in terms of those primitives, for example, as polygonal meshes. However, to approximate a continuum manipulator with a polygonal mesh requires a fine mesh because of its concavity, and each time the manipulator changes its configuration by deforming its shape, the mesh has to be updated for the new configuration. This makes mesh-based collision detection involving such a robot much more computationally expensive than that involving an articulated manipulator with rigid links.Hence, we introduce an efficient algorithm for Collision Detection between a Continuum Manipulator (CD-CoM) and its environment based on analytical intersection checking with nonconvex primitives. Our algorithm applies to the exact model of any continuum manipulator consisting of multiple uniform-curvature sections of toroidal and (sometimes) cylindrical shapes as well as more general continuum manipulators whose sections can be approximated by toroidal and cylindrical primitives. Our test results show that using this algorithm is both more accurate and efficient in time and space to detect collisions than approximating a continuum manipulator as a polygonal mesh. Moreover, the CD-CoM algorithm also provides the minimum distance information between the continuum manipulator and objects when there is no collision. Such an efficient algorithm is essential for path/trajectory planning of continuum manipulators in real-time.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2014.0

Given the double jeopardy hypothesis, the authors might anticipate that older women would be denigrated most in hiring evaluations. However, given expectations of normative gender behavior, the authors might anticipate that older men would be penalized most for not already having stable employment. This study aims to examine which hypothesis best describes selection biases based on age and gender.Design/methodology/approach – Stimuli depicting male and female job applicants at the various ages were developed. The stimuli were standardized by collecting facial photos of older White men and women at ages 20, 40, and 60, and morphing these faces onto standardized bodies using Adobe Photoshop. Participants viewed six stimuli, one from each age by gender combination, and made evaluations across job relevant dimensions.Findings – Results showed an interaction between age and gender, such that older male applicants were evaluated more negatively than older female and younger male applicants. These findings support for the violation of gender normative behavior hypothesis.Practical implications – This study has implications for organizational leaders who can use this information to provide training for selection officers concerning biases against older workers and how to avoid them.Originality/value – Original, novel stimuli are used in an experimental design to examine the effects of age in employment in a standardized manner which controls for extraneous variables such as attractiveness across age.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Psychology,2014.0

We classify firms into three access categories: private, unrated public and rated public. Private firms have the lowest access, and to date, no large sample investigation of their loans has been done in the literature. Rated public firms access the capital markets the most. We find the level of access influences loan structure in ways that are consistent with having greater or fewer financing alternatives, as well as theories on information asymmetry, agency and monitoring. In particular, loans to firms with higher levels of access have shorter maturities, fewer loan facilities per package, and a lower probability of being secured. We also find that a higher level of access results in a higher incidence of single-lender loans, but among multiple-lender loans, it leads to a larger number of lenders. Furthermore, we find evidence that access affects financial covenants in a nonmonotonic manner. Finally, lender type and economic conditions influence loan structure.

The mechanisms underlying this central activation deficit (CAD) are unknown, although cortical mechanisms may be involved. Here, we utilize transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to assess corticospinal and intracortical excitability in patients with knee OA and in a comparably aged group of healthy older adults, to quantify group differences, and to examine associations between TMS measures and pain, quadriceps strength, and CAD. Seventeen patients with knee OA and 20 healthy controls completed testing. Motor evoked potentials were measured at the quadriceps by superficial electromyographic recordings. Corticospinal excitability was assessed by measuring resting motor threshold (RMT) to TMS stimulation of the quadriceps representation at primary motor cortex, and intracortical excitability was assessed via paired-pulse paradigms for short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF). No statistically significant differences between patients with knee OA and healthy controls were found for RMT, SICI or ICF measures (p > 0.05). For patients with knee OA, there were significant associations observed between pain and RMT, as well as between pain and ICF. No associations were observed between CAD and measures of corticospinal or intracortical excitability.

Methods: In this paper, we introduce a miniature robotic device called LaserBot, which can manipulate a femtosecond laser beam to drill/burr a decayed tooth to realize clinical tooth crown preparation. In order to control the 3D motion of the laser focal point on the surface of a tooth, three miniature voice-coil motors with optical grating rulers are utilized to drive the 2D pitch/yaw rotation of a vibration mirror and 1D translation of a protruding optical lens. This method can provide high-resolution control of the laser beam. In order to maintain the small size of the robot, a parallel five linkage mechanism combined with a slider-rocker mechanism is developed to realize 2D pitch/yaw rotation of the vibration mirror. Results: Experiment results show that the movement range and resolution of the laser beam point can meet the requirement of typical dental operations. The size of the working end of the device that enters the mouth is 25×22×57 mm (height×width×length), which is small enough to be mounted on any tooth. The average repeatability error of the laser focal point is about 40 μm. Ablation experiments on wax-resin material and on tooth validate that a femtosecond laser can be used for tooth ablation.

Specifically, we first propose to accurately locate the ranking fraud by mining the active periods, namely leading sessions, of mobile Apps. Such leading sessions can be leveraged for detecting the local anomaly instead of global anomaly of App rankings. Furthermore, we investigate three types of evidences, i.e., ranking based evidences, rating based evidences and review based evidences, by modeling Apps' ranking, rating and review behaviors through statistical hypotheses tests. In addition, we propose an optimization based aggregation method to integrate all the evidences for fraud detection. Finally, we evaluate the proposed system with real-world App data collected from the iOS App Store for a long time period. In the experiments, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed system, and show the scalability of the detection algorithm as well as some regularity of ranking fraud activities.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2015.0

Author Bruce VanSledright argues that traditional and typical standardized testing approaches are seldom up to the task of measuring the more complex understandings students are asked to attain, as they cannot fully assess what the student knows. Rather, he points forward along a path toward changes in learning, teaching, and assessing that closely aligns with the Common Core State Standards. He delves into the types of history knowledge the standards require, illustrates how they can be applied in-use in history learning contexts, and theorizes how the standards might fit together cognitively to produce deep historical understandings among students in teaching-learning contexts. By providing a variety of assessment strategies and items that align with the standards, and identifying rich, useful assessment rubrics applicable to the different types of assessments, he offers an important resource for social studies teachers and curriculum writers alike.",Education,Reading and Elementary Education,2013.0

2-s2.0-84917690992,Article,"Local government planning agencies play an important role in conserving biodiversity in human-altered landscapes. Such agencies frequently have a limited knowledge of wildlife biology and few resources to carry out research, and therefore require simple, practical guidelines for biodiversity conservation. We propose a landscape design framework for biodiversity conservation that is sequential, prescriptive, and supported by current landscape ecological science. Unlike existing guidelines, our framework can be implemented in any given landscape using only land cover data and it explicitly considers constraints on land use planning. The steps of our framework, in the order in which they should be implemented are: (1) select land cover data and decide which land cover classes constitute unaltered or altered land covers; (2) list the constraints on land use planning (e.g., economic, social) that exist for the landscape (3) maximize the total amount and diversity of unaltered land cover, especially near water; (4) minimize human disturbance within altered land cover, especially near water; and (5) aggregate altered land covers associated with high-intensity land uses, especially away from water. We illustrate the utility of our approach by applying it to a hypothetical landscape and comparing the outcome to those from the application of traditional ecological guidelines to inform land use planning.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2015.0

Specifically, we explore how these policies and dynamics play out spatially in the context of two Charlotte neighborhoods, both of which have similar historical roots and have become magnets for Latino settlement, yet display divergent contemporary place-making paths. Our exploration reveals the ways in which contexts of receptivity and spaces of both exclusion and inclusion are created by the socio-spatial components of public policy and the localized response to that policy at the intraurban level. Reinforcing the importance of space and place in the construction of receptivity contexts, the compared stories of Eastside and South Charlotte reveal that neighborhoods are never the product of one transformational force but of many-no matter how they may be perceived in the public imaginary.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2015.0
2-s2.0-84918569251,Article,"Vibrio vulnificus is a natural inhabitant of estuarine waters worldwide and is of medical relevance due to its ability to cause grievous wound infections and/or fatal septicemia. Genetic polymorphisms within the virulence-correlated gene (vcg) serve as a primary feature to distinguish clinical (C-) genotypes from environmental (E-) genotypes. C-genotypes demonstrate superior survival in human serum relative to E-genotypes, and genome comparisons have allowed for the identification of several putative virulence factors that could potentially aid Cgenotypes in disease progression. We used RNA sequencing to analyze the transcriptome of C-genotypes exposed to human serum relative to seawater, which revealed two divergent genetic programs under these two conditions. In human serum, cells displayed a distinct ""virulence profile"" in which a number of putative virulence factors were upregulated, including genes involved in intracellular signaling, substrate binding and transport, toxin and exoenzyme production, and the heat shock response. Conversely, the ""environmental profile"" exhibited by cells in seawater revealed upregulation of transcription factors such as rpoS, rpoN, and iscR, as well as genes involved in intracellular signaling, chemotaxis, adherence, and biofilm formation. This dichotomous genetic switch appears to be largely governed by cyclic-di-GMP signaling, and remarkably resembles the dual life-style of V. cholerae as it transitions from host to environment. Furthermore, we found a ""general stress response"" module, known as the stressosome, to be upregulated in seawater. This signaling system has been well characterized in Gram-positive bacteria, however its role in V. vulnificus is not clear. We examined temporal gene expression patterns of the stressosome and found it to be upregulated in natural estuarine waters indicating that this system plays a role in sensing and responding to the environment. This study advances our understanding of gene regulation in V. vulnificus, and brings to the forefront a number of previously overlooked genetic networks.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2014.0

Results revealed that the hypothesized curvilinear relationships were observed in the PTG domain of relating to others and the combined domain of spiritual change and appreciation of life, whereas linear relationships were found in the personal strength and new possibilities domains.

Historically, attention has been focused on the general cognitive ability factor at the center of the intelligence nexus (i.e., the '. g' factor). Although the focus on '. g' has and continues to provide insight into successful behavior in the workplace, there is interest and need to expand the measurement space to include other aspects of the intelligence nexus. Drawing on examples in the differential and educational literatures, we argue that giving attention to constellations of more specific cognitive aptitudes can provide additional insight into the manifestation of the complex skills and competencies that are required for success in today's workplace. Unfortunately, as I-O psychology has pulled away from the study of mental abilities, the effort to increase the measurement space has spawned an increase in construct proliferation (e.g., competency-based constructs such as decision-making, strategic thinking, etc.) that crowds and confuses the construct domain without properly leveraging what is known about specific mental abilities. Thus, our purpose is to encourage I-O psychology to reconnect with the science of mental abilities and measurement theory so as better understand how basic constructs within the intelligence nexus manifest in the context of work.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Psychology,2015.0

In this paper, we propose an Energy Efficient Social-based Routing (EESR) protocol to reduce the load of nodes while maintaining the delivery ratio within an acceptable range by limiting the chances of forwarding in traditional social-based routing. Furthermore, we also propose an improved version of EESR to dynamically adjust the controlling parameter.

Biomarkers may provide diagnostic, prognostic, or burden of disease indicators of OA before radiographic changes become apparent. Unfortunately, there has been no systematic review to clarify which biomarkers may be most informative following injury. Therefore, this review critically investigated existing studies of OA-related biomarkers in ACL-deficient (ACL-D) and reconstructed (ACL-R) patients to summarize the current evidence and identify knowledge gaps. Design: A systematic review of the literature in Web of Science and PubMed databases (1960-June 2014) was performed. All English-language case-control and longitudinal studies assessing OA-related biomarkers in ACL-D and ACL-R patients were considered. Data regarding biomarker changes over time within ACL-D and ACL-R patients as well as differences in ACL-D/ACL-R patients compared with a control group were extracted from pertinent studies. Results: A descriptive summary of 20 included studies was produced. In ACL-D patients compared with controls, synovial fluid biomarkers indicated elevated collagen turnover, while the inflammatory cytokine response was inconclusive. In ACL-R patients, serum concentrations indicated decreased collagen breakdown, but urine concentrations were indicative of greater collagen breakdown when compared to controls. Compared to preoperative values, the overall inflammatory cytokine response measured with synovial fluid biomarkers increased while plasma biomarkers did not change following reconstruction. Conclusion: Patients with ACL-D or ACL-R have altered biomarkers indicative of OA.

2-s2.0-84919387654,Article,"This paper reviews the geological setting and reports new geochemical trace element data from the Ordovician Lawrence Head Volcanics (LHV) and the underlying gabbro sills in the Exploits Group. In combination with existing published analyses and ages of these rocks, the volcanic rocks and sills are indistinguishable in composition and age, and the data are consistent with the hypothesis that they represent the same (mostly E-MORB composition) magmatic event in the early–mid Darriwilian (~465 ± 2 Ma). The LHV and their enclosing strata show regional evidence for: 1) upward decline of volume and grain size of arc-derived volcaniclastic materials over the uppermost interval of turbidite sedimentary strata below the LHV; 2) change to shallow marine conditions locally by the end of the LHV event, followed immediately by significant subsidence, and 3) no evidence of coarse-grained clastic input, nor of normal faulting, during or immediately after LHV magmatism. Ridge–trench interaction (ridge subduction) at a subduction system is consistent with all of these features and spatial distribution of related elements, but a rift (back-arc) origin over a subduction zone can only accommodate the compositions, and is inconsistent with the geological evidence. The Dunnage Mélange (DM) has been interpreted either as olistostromal in a developing back-arc rift basin, or as a subduction accretionary prism. Peraluminous intrusions in the mélange (Coaker Porphyry –– CP) are more readily explained by ridge subduction, and a previously reported zircon age (469 ± 4 Ma) is consistent with the age of the LHV and gabbro sills, also interpreted as products of ridge subduction. Localization of the CP in the eastern area of DM, and of most of the large LHV-derived volcanic blocks in the western DM, suggests a slightly younger age, and perhaps a different mechanism, for the origin of the western DM.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2014.0

Neighborhoods in Charlotte, North Carolina, are used as a case study, and change is modeled at several time lags throughout the 2000-2010 decade. Findings indicate that the model performs well and that it offers a very promising avenue for modeling the socioeconomic changes of neighborhoods that accounts for complex longitudinal effects as well as spatial dependencies. Specifically, it shows that lower human capital manifested by a decline in youth indicators is significant in explaining subsequent increases in crime and declines in economic indicators. Also, the predominance of housing stock constructed in the 1950s and 1960s is a significant trigger of declines across all neighborhood indicators.

2-s2.0-84919475713,Article,"The evolution of pulmonary disease in cystic fibrosis (CF) usually begins when bacteria get trapped in mucus in the lungs and become established as a chronic infection. While most CF patients experience periods of stability, pulmonary exacerbations (PEs) can occur multiple times per year and result in permanent damage to the lungs. Little is known of the shift from a period of stability to a PE, but this shift is likely to be attributed to changes in the bacterial community. Here, we identified changes in the lung microbiota to determine if they reflect patient health, indicate the onset of exacerbations, or are related to antibiotic treatment. In contrast to most bacterial studies on CF, we collected weekly samples from an adult CF patient over a period of 3 years and performed quantitative PCR (qPCR) and Illumina sequencing on those samples. While many DNA-based studies have shown the CF microbiota to be relatively stable, we observed an increase in the total bacterial abundance over time (P < 0.001), while the number of different taxa (bacterial richness) and the number of different taxa and their abundances (diversity) significantly decreased over time (P < 0.03), which was likely due to repeated antibiotic exposure. Using genus-specific primers with qPCR, we observed an increase in the abundance of Burkholderia multivorans, a CF-associated pathogen, prior to the occurrence of a PE (P = 0.006). Combining these DNA-based techniques with frequent sampling identified a potential initiator for exacerbations and described a response of the CF microbiota to time and antibiotic treatment not observed in previous CF microbiota studies.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2015.0

The responses to this form of criminal behavior include penal incarceration followed by civil commitment, community notification, and sex offender registration. To date, evidence-based findings report that these correctives and/or curatives yield limited effectiveness sufficient to justify their continued maintenance as statewide or even national criminal justice and mental health policy prescription. One official systems-level way that policy receives legitimacy is through the Courts. Interestingly, the precedent-setting sex offender case law indicates that current policy prescriptions are constitutionally permissible and therefore justifiable as regulatory practices, notwithstanding the empirical evidence that challenges their soundness. This article summarizes the science regarding sex offender policy from the point of imprisonment to reentry, recounts the relevant case law that judicially sanctions such institutional and community practices, and explains how the driver for sex offender law and policy is legal moralism grounded in and advanced by utilitarian reasoning and duty-based logic. This article concludes by suggesting how judicial reliance on legal moralism could further the interests of public safety and civil liberties if insights from virtue jurisprudence informed the analysis.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Criminal Justice and Criminology,2015.0

This article explores the utility of PJ—especially as a basis to reconfigure the problem of crime, to redefine institutional responses to it, and to reconceive the process of desistance. To accomplish this objective, the article addresses two issues. First, it explains how the diagnostic and cultural footing of PJ functions as philosophical critique concerning the subject of crime.

With more than 100,000 papers published each year just in computer science, performing a complete literature search becomes a Herculean task. Some of the existing approaches and tools for literature search cannot compete with the characteristics of today's literature, and they suffer from ambiguity and homonymy. Techniques based on citation information are more robust to the mentioned issues. Thus, we recently built a Web service called theadvisor, which provides personalized recommendations to researchers based on their papers of interest. Since most recommendation methods may return redundant results, diversifying the results of the search process is necessary to increase the amount of information that one can reach via an automated search. This article targets the problem of result diversification in citation-based bibliographic search, assuming that the citation graph itself is the only information available and no categories or intents are known. The contribution of this work is threefold. We survey various random walk-based diversification methods and enhance them with the direction awareness property to allow users to reach either old, foundational (possibly well-cited and well-known) research papers or recent (most likely less-known) ones. Next, we propose a set of novel algorithms based on vertex selection and query refinement.

In clinical trials, there are a large amount of datasets acquired from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or X-ray computed tomography (CT) that requires automatic labeling of individual tissues. Since most segmentation algorithms are not suited for different modalities, we present an automatic and robust framework for the quantitative assessment of muscle and fat tissues on 3D MR or CT data. In our framework, a variational Bayesian Gaussian mixture model is used to cluster regions of interest in images into adipose tissues (fat and marrow), muscle, bone and background. The identification of each cluster is based on marrow detection. Furthermore, we use a combination of parametric and geodesic active contour models to distinguish different adipose tissues in 3D images.

To date, the impact of urban patterns on forest carbon density remains to be systematically evaluated. A major challenge is the lack of accurate and spatially explicit estimates of forest carbon storage over the entire urbanized area. In this study, we first developed an integrated approach that synergizes remote sensing LiDAR (light detection and ranging) and aerial photography to efficiently model landscape-level forest carbon storage in an urban environment at a fine resolution of 20. m. Using a case study in the Charlotte Metropolitan Region, USA, we were able to determine the total amount of carbon stored in the local forests to be 3.8 million tonnes ($298 million value), with an average carbon density of 53.6. t/ha. We further applied statistical analysis to investigate the relationship between urban developed patterns (i.e., landscape metrics) and forest carbon density in four types of residential neighborhoods (categorized by percent built-up ranging from low, medium-low, medium-high to high density). Results indicate a decrease of forest carbon density with an increase of carbon variance in neighborhoods where the intensity of development became higher. Residential neighborhoods with a higher built-up density were more likely to be affected by a larger number of landscape metrics. This indicates that a proper design of the neighborhood level urban spatial patterns (especially in high density neighborhoods) is essential to maximizing forest carbon storage at the landscape level.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2015.0
2-s2.0-84919935887,Conference Paper,"Head pose estimation from images is a challenging task with extensive applications. It has been attracting research attentions over decades and numerous approaches have been proposed. Among them, manifold embedding based methods, which assume that the pose variations lie on a low-dimensional manifold embedded in the high-dimensional feature space, have achieved great success. However, previous manifold embedding based methods have two drawbacks: first, they lack the capability to simultaneously deal with multiple pose-unrelated factors in a uniform way, second, they suffer from limited representation ability for out-of-sample testing inputs. In this paper we propose a novel head pose estimation method to address these problems. By learning the mapping from a uniform geometry representation to individual instance manifolds, this approach allows us to parameterize various pose-unrelated factors under a uniform framework. Our approach is a generative model which guarantees the reasonable and effective representation of new testing input. Besides, by employing eigen instance bases instead of full instance bases arisen from the training data, we can effectively compact the size of the trained model and significantly simplify the computational complexity of the testing process.

However, most existing methods are concentrated on preserving spatial domain properties like density and anisotropy, while ignoring feature preserving. In order to solve the problem, we present a new distance metric called mixture distance for blue noise sampling, which is a combination of geodesic and feature distances. Based on mixture distance, the blue noise property and features can be preserved by controlling the ratio of the geodesic distance to the feature distance. With the intention of meeting different requirements from various applications, an adaptive adjustment for parameters is also proposed to achieve a balance between the preservation of features and spatial properties. Finally, implementation on a graphic processing unit is introduced to improve the efficiency of computation. The efficacy of the method is demonstrated by the results of image stippling, surface sampling, and remeshing.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2014.0
2-s2.0-84920736070,Conference Paper,"The impact of individual copy number variants (CNVs) on human traits is becoming increasingly clear through technological advances in genetic studies. However, interactions between CNVs exerting joint effects on phenotypes has not been well characterized since the sheer number of CNVs in the human genome, presents a computational challenge for evaluating interactions among multiple CNVs. To address this unmet need and characterize CNVs that cooperate with each other to modulate phenotype, we developed a novel systematic approach, CNVnet, which combines sparse learning and biological networks to identify interacting CNVs with joint phenotypic effect. We applied CNVnet to analyze the CNV catalog of human genomes from the 1000 Genomes Project and identified CNVs that collectively contribute to population differentiation, affect gene expression patterns, and potentially have downstream biomedical implications. Our approach establishes a framework to analyze the manner by which multiple genetic variants act in concert to affect a given phenotype.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2014.0

2-s2.0-84920871303,Article,"Background: Associations between genotype and phenotype provide insight into the evolution of pathogenesis, drug resistance, and the spread of pathogens between hosts. However, common ancestry can lead to apparent associations between biologically unrelated features. The novel method Cladograms with Path to Event (ClaPTE) detects associations between character-pairs (either a pair of mutations or a mutation paired with a phenotype) while adjusting for common ancestry, using phylogenetic trees. Methods: ClaPTE tests for character-pairs changing close together on the phylogenetic tree, consistent with an associated character-pair. ClaPTE is compared to three existing methods (independent contrasts, mixed model, and likelihood ratio) to detect character-pair associations adjusted for common ancestry. Comparisons utilize simulations on gene trees for: HIV Env, HIV promoter, and bacterial DnaJ and GuaB; and case studies for Oseltamavir resistance in Influenza, and for DnaJ and GuaB. Simulated data include both true-positive/associated character-pairs, and true-negative/not-associated character-pairs, used to assess type I (frequency of p-values in true-negatives) and type II (sensitivity to true-positives) error control. Results and conclusions: ClaPTE has competitive sensitivity and better type I error control than existing methods. In the Influenza/Oseltamavir case study, ClaPTE reports no new permissive mutations but detects associations between adjacent (in primary sequence) amino acid positions which other methods miss. In the DnaJ and GuaB case study, ClaPTE reports more frequent associations between positions both from the same protein family than between positions from different families, in contrast to other methods. In both case studies, the results from ClaPTE are biologically plausible.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2015.0

Twenty-five participants with self-reported CAI and 27 healthy control participants volunteered for this study. Participants walked on a motor-driven treadmill for 3. min at their selected speed. Lower extremity kinematics in the sagittal and frontal planes were recorded using a passive retroreflective marker motion capture system. The temporal structure of walking variability was analyzed with sample entropy (SampEn). The CAI group produced lower SampEn values in frontal-plane ankle kinematics compared to the control group (P=04). No significant group differences were observed for SampEn values of other kinematics (P > 05). Participants with CAI demonstrated less stride-to-stride variability of the frontal plane ankle kinematics compared to healthy controls. Decreased variability of walking patterns demonstrated by participants with CAI indicates that the presence of CAI may be associated with a less adaptable sensorimotor system to environmental changes. The altered sensorimotor function associated with CAI may be targets for clinical interventions, and it is critical to explore how interventions protocols affect sensorimotor system function.",CHHS,Kinesiology,2015.0

Total health care costs were lower for ADPKD patients than for control patients on dialysis. Patients with ADPKD were generally younger, had a lower Charlson Comorbidity Index, and had lower rates of comorbid conditions, which may have contributed to the lower overall costs seen for patients with ADPKD.Conclusion: Health care resource utilization and costs for patients with ADPKD in ESRD requiring dialysis were high, and therapeutic interventions that can prevent or delay the progression to ESRD may increase dialysis-free life for patients with ADPKD.Background: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the leading inheritable cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and one of the leading causes of ESRD overall. ADPKD patients differ from the overall dialysis population; however, there is little published data regarding health care costs for ADPKD patients on dialysis.Methods: This retrospective observational cohort study was designed to quantify health care utilization and costs for ADPKD patients with ESRD who received initial services at a single large dialysis organization between January 1, 2 007 and December 3 1, 2 009. Parallel results and baseline patient characteristics for control patients with ESRD etiologies other than ADPKD were performed for reference.

2-s2.0-84921033184,Article,"Surficial processes acting on post-glacial alpine and sub-alpine landscapes vary at small temporal and spatial scales and are thus often difficult to conceptualize in the context of large-scale landscape evolution models. Soils developing in this setting can thus provide valuable information about landform genesis, sedimentology and age. Relatively few post-glacial chronosequences have been examined in these settings however, particularly for the variety of landforms and parent materials that exist within alpine and sub-alpine environments. Here, we examine a chronosequence of relatively young, post-glacial landforms with varying parent materials and climate histories. We dug and described 39 soil pits in the upper Conejos River Valley of Colorado on a variety of deposits and landforms, including alluvial fans, terraces, colluvium, glacial till, and terminal moraines, and compared soil properties with radiocarbon ages from the area. Our results suggest that some typical chronosequence soil properties (e.g., pH, structure, color) do not correlate with time over short time scales. However, extractable iron ratios (Feo/Fed) show a relatively strong correlation with age across late-Pleistocene and Holocene time scales and maximum profile clay content shows a weak but statistically significant relationship with age. Both of these trends are stronger when examined across a single parent material. Differences in initial parent material texture and dust inputs seem to be the most significant complicating factors over post-glacial time scales. Soil property development through time is most inconsistent in cumulic alluvial fan soils. This observation may indicate that alluvial fans are more responsive to sub-basin scale processes as opposed to fluvial terraces that are more likely respond to processes active across the entire basin. These differences would explain why stratigraphically similar alluvial fans are mantled by soils with varying development. Nonetheless, horizonation, clay content, and extractable iron ratios provide a useful tool for correlating young deposits, assigning ages, and interpreting the geomorphic history of complex post-glacial environments.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2015.0

Despite escalating health expenditure, the United States continues to have higher rates of diabetes than many other developed countries. There is a need for health care reform in the United States not only in reducing health care costs but also in improving the quality of preventative care. This study presents the testing of a multilevel model investigating variables on the individual and state levels to develop a better understanding of the most important contextual pathways that can lead to providing older adults (50+) with type 2 diabetes with the recommended preventative quality care they require. The model was tested using a three-level repeated cross-sectional design with data from various existing data sources, using a national sample of 181,870 individuals aged 50 years and older. Results showed that differences in state health care systems contributed to inequitable access. Specifically, in a state where there was a higher percentage of adults 65 and older coupled with a shortage of health care professionals, the likelihood of receiving the recommended preventative quality care decreased. Also, older adults living in states with a higher percentage of people with diagnosed diabetes but with a lower-than-average annual per capita health care expenditure fared worse in receiving quality preventative care. Last, older adults in wealthy states with higher percentages of uninsured people had the lowest odds of receiving quality preventative care.

The method of protocol analysis was employed to study the cognitive behaviors that occurred while these designers were working in the PDE. By analyzing the way in which the designers shifted between ""problem"" and ""solution"" spaces in the PDE, characteristics of the coevolutionary design process are identified and discussed. Results of this research include two potentially significant observations. First, the coevolution process occurs frequently within the design knowledge level (i.e., when using Rhino) and within the rule algorithm level (i.e., when using Grasshopper) of the parametric design process. Second, the designers' coevolution process was focused on the design knowledge level at the beginning of the design session, while they focused more on the rule algorithm level toward the end of the design session.

This relationship between employer size and standard hours is stronger in more marketized regions. These findings support the authors' argument that standard work hours are deinstitutionalized as employers strive for low cost and flexibility in China's increasingly marketized but poorly regulated economy.

Many approaches tackle this problem through content-based image retrieval techniques. However, most of them fall short of scalability in the retrieval stage, and their diagnostic accuracy is, therefore, restricted. To overcome this drawback, we propose a scalable method for retrieval and diagnosis of mammographic masses. Specifically, for a query mammographic region of interest (ROI), scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) features are extracted and searched in a vocabulary tree, which stores all the quantized features of previously diagnosed mammographic ROIs. In addition, to fully exert the discriminative power of SIFT features, contextual information in the vocabulary tree is employed to refine the weights of tree nodes. The retrieved ROIs are then used to determine whether the query ROI contains a mass. The presented method has excellent scalability due to the low spatial-temporal cost of vocabulary tree. Extensive experiments are conducted on a large dataset of 11 553 ROIs extracted from the digital database for screening mammography, which demonstrate the accuracy and scalability of our approach.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2014.0
2-s2.0-84921532176,Conference Paper,"Legacy energy infrastructures are being replaced by modern smart grids. Smart grids provide bi-directional communications for the purpose of efficient energy and load management. In addition, energy generation is adjusted based on the load feedback. However, due to the dependency on the cyber infrastructure for load monitoring and reporting, generation control is inherently vulnerable to attacks. Recent studies have shown that the possibility of data integrity attacks on the generation control can significantly disrupt the energy system. In this work, we present simple yet effective data-driven two-tier intrusion detection system for automatic generation control (AGC). The first tier is a short-term adaptive predictor for system variables, such as load and area control error (ACE). The first tier provides a real-time measurement predictor that adapts to the underlying changing behavior of these system variables, and flags out the abnormal behavior in these variables independently. The second tier provides deep state inspection to investigate the presence of anomalies by incorporating the overall system variable correlation using Markov models. Moreover, we expand our second tier inspection to include multi-AGC environment where a behavior of one AGC is validated against the behavior of the interconnected AGC. The combination of tier-1 light-weight prediction and tier-2 offline deep state inspection offers a great advantage to balance accuracy and real-time requirements of intrusion detection for AGC environment.

The transitions and sequences of neighborhoods through these groups are compared, revealing marked differences in the dynamics of neighborhoods according by city. Findings show that while Struggling neighborhoods, characterized largely by high poverty and unemployment levels, were very unlikely to transition out of this group over the course of 50 years in the cities of Buffalo, Charlotte, and Chicago, nearly half Portland's struggling neighborhoods transitioned to a neighborhood of higher socioeconomic status during that time period.

2-s2.0-84921654595,Article,"The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) is an ideal model organism to study the cell fate specification mechanisms during embryogenesis. It is generally believed that cell fate specification in C. elegans is mainly mediated by lineage-based mechanisms, where the specification paths are driven forward by a succession of asymmetric cell divisions. However, little is known about how each binary decision is made by gene regulatory programs. In this study, we endeavor to obtain a global understanding of cell lineage/fate divergence processes during the early embryogenesis of C. elegans. We reanalyzed the EPIC data set, which traced the expression level of reporter genes at single-cell resolution on a nearly continuous time scale up to the 350-cell stage in C. elegans embryos. We examined the expression patterns for a total of 131 genes from 287 embryos with high quality image recordings, among which 86 genes have replicate embryos. Our results reveal that during early embryogenesis, divergence between sister lineages could be largely explained by a few genes. We predicted genes driving lineage divergence and explored their expression patterns in sister lineages. Moreover, we found that divisions leading to fate divergence are associated with a large number of genes being differentially expressed between sister lineages. Interestingly, we found that the developmental paths of lineages could be differentiated by a small set of genes. Therefore, our results support the notion that the cell fate patterns in C. elegans are achieved through stepwise binary decisions punctuated by cell divisions. Our predicted genes driving lineage divergence provide good starting points for future detailed characterization of their roles in the embryogenesis in this important model organism.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2014.0

In this paper, inspired by popular invariant feature descriptors such as histograms of oriented gradients (HOG) and the scale invariant feature transform (SIFT), we propose a new invariant descriptor of fingerprint ridge texture called histograms of invariant gradients (HIG). The proposed descriptor is designed to preserve robustness to variations in gradient positions.

2-s2.0-84921820206,Article,"Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) of mammographic masses is important yet challenging, since masses have large variation in shape and size and are often indistinguishable from surrounding tissue. As an alternative solution, content-based image retrieval (CBIR) techniques can facilitate the diagnosis by finding visually similar cases. However, they still need radiologists to identify suspicious regions in the query case. To overcome the drawbacks of both kinds of methods, we propose a CAD approach that integrates image retrieval with learning-based mass detection. Specifically, a query mammogram is first matched with a database of exemplar masses, getting a series of similarity maps. Then these maps are subtracted by discriminatively learned thresholds to eliminate noise. At last, individual similarity maps are aggregated, and local maxima in the final map are selected as masses. By utilizing a large database, our approach can effectively detect masses despite their variation. Moreover, it bypasses the identification of suspicious regions by radiologists. Experiments are conducted on 500 mammograms randomly selected from the digital database for screening mammography (DDSM) using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.

Action rules present users with a set of actionable tasks to follow to achieve a desired result. An action rule can be seen as two patterns of feature values (classification rules) occurring together and having the same features. Action rules are evaluated using their supporting patterns occurrence in a measure called support. They are also evaluated using their confidence defined as the product of the two patterns confidences. Those two measures are important to evaluate action rules; nonetheless, they fail to measure the feature values transition correlation and applicability. This is due to the core of the action rules extraction process that extracts independent patterns and constructs an action rule. In this chapter, we present the benefits of meta-actions in evaluating action rules in terms of two measures, namely likelihood and execution confidence. In fact, in meta-actions, we extract real feature values transition patterns, rather than composing two feature values patterns. We also present an evaluation model of the application of meta-actions based on cost and satisfaction.

We argue that there are at least two fundamentally different views, or motivational perspectives, that people can have about caregiving. Caregiving in the egosystem is viewed as a means for people to satisfy their own needs and desires; although their behavior may appear selfless or selfsacrificing, they provide care because of what they will obtain, or what it means about them. In contrast, caregiving in the ecosystem results from genuine concern for the wellbeing of others; although such caregiving often has benefits for the self, those benefits are not the primary reasons why people provide care. These two motivational perspectives on caregiving have paradoxical effects; we describe evidence that caregiving in the egosystem, which aims to obtain benefits for the self, actually undermines the support the caregiver receives from others, undermines relationship quality, decreases the caregiver's self-esteem and mental health, and even decreases the regard the care recipient has for the caregiver. Because caregivers often are unaware of these paradoxical effects, when they feel that their needs are not being met, they can persist with giving care in the egosystem, creating just the opposite of what they really want.

2-s2.0-84921893070,Article,"We investigate factors influencing the international retailing of cultural products by concentrating on two cultural elements: (1) consumer-perceived cultural content embedded in the product and (2) the general cultural environment of the foreign market. To test cross-culture predictability in international retailing, we develop a novel text mining procedure to elicit the specific cultural content of the product using consumers' online product reviews. In addition, to measure the general cultural environment of the market, we apply Hofstede's cultural distance measure. To explain foreign markets' acceptance of culturally specific elements, we theorize that the relationship between inter-country cultural distance and product sales is U shaped because of both cultural discount and cultural premium. In our empirical analysis using American movies in international retailing, we find that the two specified types of cultural factors determine a movie's success, along with the movie's characteristics and the market's economic environment. From a managerial perspective, international retailers that understand the delicate implications of the match/mismatch of their general national culture and the imported product's specific cultural content can better predict the international success of imported cultural products.",Business,Marketing,2015.0
2-s2.0-84921921951,Article,"Participants in previous studies of brief mindfulness meditation (MM) are often tested immediately following a meditation session, making it difficult to separate several days of training from one-session effects. The current study examined the effects of a single session of 25 min of MM compared with a sham meditation (sham M) and a book-listening control. One session of both MM and sham M had a significant effect on state mindfulness compared with the control. Several mood subscales as well as total distress score on the Profile of Mood States (POMS) were also significantly different from control. However, neither meditation condition had significant effects on any of the attention and working memory tasks. These results indicate that one session of meditation was not sufficient to affect the cognitive tasks used in this study. Both MM and sham M positively affected mood states and heightened state mindfulness.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Psychology,2013.0
2-s2.0-84921953103,Article,"One of the consistent research findings is the relationship between age and inmate misconduct. Previous research indicates that as inmates age, they are generally involved in less-deviant behavior and less-violent behavior, thus showing an inverse relationship between age and inmate deviant behavior. However, most of the previous studies examining age focused attention on comparing young offenders with middle-age offenders. The unique challenges faced by older inmates may complicate adjustment as these offenders struggle to fit into facilities that were not designed to house older offenders. Using data from the Survey of Inmates in State Correctional Facilities, we examine the types of violations committed by older versus younger inmates. The findings suggest that there are important differences in the factors associated with misconduct for older inmates as compared to younger prisoners and point to the need to further explore how to best manage the aging prisoner population.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Criminal Justice and Criminology,2015.0

One way in which this research is unique is that it focuses exclusively on a sample of older offenders and makes more precise distinctions by separately examining three categories of elderly offenders-the young-old, the middle-old, and the oldest-old. Consistent with prior research, our findings indicate an age leniency effect where younger defendants (the young-old) had the highest odds and older defendants (the oldest-old) had the lowest odds of incarceration. However, contrary to expectations, this finding does not hold for the sentence length decision. Legal factors (criminal history, number of counts, going to trial) also played a large role in increasing the likelihood and length of their sentence outcomes. In addition, variations were found across different types of offense categories. The findings in this study point to the importance of making clearer distinctions between the elderly offender populations and suggest that findings may be masked if differences between the young-old and the old-old are not considered. Our results indicate the need for continued exploration of issues dealing specifically with the aging prison population, as well as the examination of policies and practices that impact offenders of all ages.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Criminal Justice and Criminology,2015.0

Blood was collected using a syringe with a cannula inserted into a super.- cial arm vein with samples collected at rest, after each 7 min stage and 5 and 15 min into recovery. With training, all groups observed shifted plasma Peptide F responses to graded exercise, where signi.cant increases were observed at lower exercise intensities.

2-s2.0-84922246571,Conference Paper,"The Everona fault is a Cenozoic, possibly Pliocene, tectonic structure that is superimposed on an older orogen-parallel shear zone called the Mountain Run fault zone in the Blue Ridge foothills of central Virginia (USA). The Everona fault was originally defi ned from an excavation in Orange County, Virginia, that uncovered an unconformity between highly weathered mylonitic rocks in the older Mountain Run fault zone, and an overlying colluvial and fl uvial sequence of pebble gravel and massive, ferruginous loamy sand reminiscent of higher terrace deposits in the greater Rapidan River basin. This unconformity is faulted and the channel morphology of the sedimentary deposits is warped into an antiform above several reverse faults. Some of these faults we examined that defi ne the Everona fault have undergone reverse dipslip movement with up-to-the-southeast displacement, based on striae on polished red and gray clay-rich fault gouge. Although the Everona fault is not known to be historically seismic (>M1.5), and is outside the normal extent of the Central Virginia seismic zone, the excavation site is only 44 km from the epicenter of the 23 August 2011 Mineral, Virginia, earthquake. From structural analysis of exposures at the original Everona excavation, it has been determined that there is a system of related reverse motion, near-surface tectonic faults with nearly pure dip-slip motion and nearly horizontal northwest-southeast trending P (pressure) axes. Observed throws on these faults approximate a couple of meters. The coincidence of faulted sedimentary deposits with a ridge-and stream terrace-forming soil (the Hiwassee series) derived from these deposits suggests that the deformation is geologically young. Potentially correlative dated stream terraces elsewhere in the western Piedmont of Virginia further suggest that motion on the Everona fault could be younger than Pliocene.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2014.0
2-s2.0-84922284045,Article,"Forest ecosystems are subject to a variety of disturbances with increasing intensities and frequencies, which may permanently change the trajectories of forest recovery and disrupt the ecosystem services provided by trees. Fire and invasive species, especially exotic disease-causing pathogens and insects, are examples of disturbances that together could pose major threats to forest health. This study examines the impacts of fire and exotic disease (sudden oak death) on forests, with an emphasis on the assessment of post-fire burn severity in a forest where trees have experienced three stages of disease progression pre-fire: early-stage (trees retaining dried foliage and fine twigs), middle-stage (trees losing fine crown fuels), and late-stage (trees falling down). The research was conducted by applying Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) to MASTER airborne images that were acquired immediately following the fire for rapid assessment and contained both high-spatial (4m) and high-spectral (50 bands) resolutions. Although GEOBIA has gradually become a standard tool for analyzing high-spatial resolution imagery, high-spectral resolution data (dozens to hundreds of bands) can dramatically reduce computation efficiency in the process of segmentation and object-based variable extraction, leading to complicated variable selection for succeeding modeling. Hence, we also assessed two widely used band reduction algorithms, PCA (principal component analysis) and MNF (minimum noise fraction), for the delineation of image objects and the subsequent performance of burn severity models using either PCA or MNF derived variables. To increase computation efficiency, only the top 5 PCA and MNF and top 10 PCA and MNF components were evaluated, which accounted for 10% and 20% of the total number of the original 50 spectral bands, respectively. Results show that if no band reduction was applied the models developed for the three stages of disease progression had relatively similar performance, where both spectral responses and texture contributed to burn assessments. However, the application of PCA and MNF introduced much greater variation among models across the three stages. For the early-stage disease progression, neither band reduction algorithms improved or retained the accuracy of burn severity modeling (except for the use of 10 MNF components). Compared to the no-band-reduction scenario, band reduction led to a greater level of overestimation of low-degree burns and underestimation of medium-degree burns, suggesting that the spectral variation removed by PCA and MNF was vital for distinguishing between the spectral reflectance from disease-induced dried crowns (still retaining high structural complexity) and fire ash. For the middle-stage, both algorithms improved the model R2 values by 2-37%, while the late-stage models had comparable or better performance to those using the original 50 spectral bands. This could be explained by the loss of tree crowns enabling better signal penetration, thus leading to reduced spectral variation from canopies. Hence, spectral bands containing a high degree of random noise were correctly removed by the band reduction algorithms. Compared to the middle-stage, the late-stage forest stands were covered by large piles of fallen trees and branches, resulting in higher variability of MASTER imagery. The ability of band reduction to improve the model performance for these late-stage forest stands was reduced, because the valuable spectral variation representing the actual late-stage forest status was partially removed by both algorithms as noise. Our results indicate that PCA and MNF are promising for balancing computation efficiency and the performance of burn severity models in forest stands subject to the middle and late stages of sudden oak death disease progression. Compared to PCA, MNF dramatically reduced image spectral variation, generating larger image objects with less complexity of object shapes. Whereas, PCA-based models delivered superior performance in most evaluated cases suggesting that some key spectral variability contributing to the accuracy of burn severity models in diseased forests may have been removed together with true spectral noise through MNF transformations.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2015.0
2-s2.0-84922344423,Article,"Automatic analysis of histopathological images has been widely utilized leveraging computational image-processing methods and modern machine learning techniques. Both computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) and content-based image-retrieval (CBIR) systems have been successfully developed for diagnosis, disease detection, and decision support in this area. Recently, with the ever-increasing amount of annotated medical data, large-scale and data-driven methods have emerged to offer a promise of bridging the semantic gap between images and diagnostic information. In this paper, we focus on developing scalable image-retrieval techniques to cope intelligently with massive histopathological images. Specifically, we present a supervised kernel hashing technique which leverages a small amount of supervised information in learning to compress a 10 000-dimensional image feature vector into only tens of binary bits with the informative signatures preserved. These binary codes are then indexed into a hash table that enables real-time retrieval of images in a large database. Critically, the supervised information is employed to bridge the semantic gap between low-level image features and high-level diagnostic information. We build a scalable image-retrieval framework based on the supervised hashing technique and validate its performance on several thousand histopathological images acquired from breast microscopic tissues. Extensive evaluations are carried out in terms of image classification (i.e., benign versus actionable categorization) and retrieval tests. Our framework achieves about 88.1% classification accuracy as well as promising time efficiency. For example, the framework can execute around 800 queries in only 0.01 s, comparing favorably with other commonly used dimensionality reduction and feature selection methods.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2015.0

A series of four studies was conducted to develop a new expanded measure of FCV. An eight-factor model of FCV was supported and confirmed. In aggregate, results from the four studies indicate that the measure is content valid, and has internally consistent scales that also demonstrated acceptable temporal stability and convergent validity. In addition, the eight scales of the measures were independent of social desirability, met criteria for measurement invariance across income groups, and predicted dietary intake.

If this results in fewer RNs or LPNs, quality degradation may occur. We evaluated the effect of regulations allowing for medication aides on subsequent medication aide use and the effect of changes in medication aide use on other nurse staffing, deficiencies, and Nursing Home Quality Initiative (NHQI) health outcome measures. Design and Methods: Staffing levels and inspection deficiencies from the Online Survey and Certification and Reporting System and NHQI data from 2004 to 2010 for facilities from eight southeastern U.S. states are used in instrumental variables models with facility fixed effects. Results: Facilities in states allowing for medication aide use increased medication aide use with no statistically significant reduction in RN or LPN use. Medication aide use decreased the probability that a facility received a deficiency citation for unnecessary drug use or having a medication error rate greater than or equal to 5% and had no effect on deficiencies for significant or harmful medication errors. Increased medication aide use was associated with fewer pharmacy and total deficiency citations and decreased use of physical restraints; in contrast, more use of medication aides was associated with an increase in the percentage of residents needing help with activities of daily living and losing continence.

2-s2.0-84922521500,Article,"Prediction of achievable dose distribution in spine stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) can help in designing high-quality treatment plans to maximally protect spinal cords and to effectively control tumours. Dose distributions at spinal cords are primarily affected by the shapes of adjacent planning target volume (PTV) contours. In this work, we estimate such contour effects and predict dose distributions by exploring active optical flow model (AOFM) and active shape model (ASM). We first collect a sequence of dose sub-images and PTV contours near spinal cords from fifteen SBRT plans in the training dataset. The data collection is then classified into five groups according to the PTV locations in relation to spinal cords. In each group, we randomly choose a dose sub-image as the reference and register all other sub-images to the reference using an optical flow method. AOFM is then constructed by importing optical flow vectors and dose values into the principal component analysis (PCA). Similarly, we build ASM by using PCA on PTV contour points. The correlation between ASM and AOFM is estimated via a stepwise multiple regression model. When predicting dose distribution of a new case, the group is first determined based on the PTV contour. The prediction model of the selected group is used to estimate dose distributions by mapping the PTV contours from the ASM space to the AOFM space. This method was validated on fifteen SBRT plans in the testing dataset. Analysis of dose-volume histograms revealed that the important D2%, D5%, D10% and D0.1cc dosimetric parameters of spinal cords between the prediction and the clinical plans were 11.7 ± 1.7 Gy versus 11.8 ± 1.7 Gy (p = 0.95), 10.9 ± 1.7 Gy versus 11.1 ± 1.9 Gy (p = 0.8295), 10.2 ± 1.6 Gy versus 10.1 ± 1.7 (p = 0.9036) and 11.2 ± 2.0 Gy versus 11.1 ± 2.2 Gy (p = 0.5208), respectively. Here, the 'cord' is the spinal cord proper (not the thecal sac) extended 5 mm inferior and superior to the involved vertebral bodies, and the 'PTV' is the involved segment of the vertebral body expanded uniformly by 2 mm but excluding the spinal cord volume expanded by 2 mm (Ref. RTOG 0631). These results suggested that the AOFM-based approach is a promising tool for predicting accurate spinal cord dose in clinical practice.

We investigate the feasibility of establishing a small set of standardized beam bouquets for planning. The set of beam bouquets were determined by learning the beam configuration features from 60 clinical lung IMRT plans designed by experienced planners. A k-medoids cluster analysis method was used to classify the beam configurations in the dataset. The appropriate number of clusters was determined by maximizing the value of average silhouette width of the classification. Once the number of clusters had been determined, the beam arrangements in each medoid of the clusters were designated as the standardized beam bouquet for the cluster. This standardized bouquet set was used to re-plan 20 cases randomly selected from the clinical database. The dosimetric quality of the plans using the beam bouquets was evaluated against the corresponding clinical plans by a paired t-test. The classification with six clusters has the largest average silhouette width value and hence would best represent the beam bouquet patterns in the dataset.

Therefore, our objective was to assess the relationship of serum sclerostin levels with coronary and aortic artery calcification (CAC and AAC, respectively) in Afro-Caribbean men on the island of Tobago. Methods: Serum sclerostin levels and computed tomography of CAC and AAC were measured in 191 men (age mean(SD): 62.9(8.0)years) recruited without regard to health status. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess the cross-sectional association of sclerostin with prevalent arterial calcification. Results: Mean(SD) sclerostin was 45.2pmol/L (15.6pmol/L).

Methods: Our study utilized data from the 2008 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) to conduct a retrospective study and secondary data analysis. To account for the multistage survey design of BRFSS, SAS/SUDAAN was used to calculate adjusted and unadjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses were performed to examine the association between race, socioeconomic status, and rurality and its effects on type 2 diabetes education among adults in North Carolina. Main Findings: The majority of the participants (63%) did not have good diabetes education. Non-Whites had higher odds than Whites of good diabetes education (OR51.56, 95%CI: 1.19, 2.03). Individuals who lived in rural North Carolina had lower odds of having good diabetes education than their urban counterparts, but the results remained insignificant (OR5 .88, CI: .67, 1.15). Individuals who were of low socioeconomic status (SES) had poorer diabetes education than individuals who were identified as being high SES, but the results were insignificant (OR5.81, CI: .60, 1.09).

For various reasons however, including user confusion and lack of proper documentation, developers may overcompensate for the necessary permission. By this we mean developers often incorporate more permissions than are necessary for an app to function, thus undermining the access control mechanism and increasing the potential risk from a vulnerability exploit where sensitive user information is compromised. Even when developers intentionally include extra permissions, we believe it still the duty of a developer to at least be aware of what is at stake when it comes to collecting user information. In this paper we present PERMITME, a tool developed as a plugin for the Eclipse IDE, to interactively guide developers on the set of required permissions when creating Android applications. We conducted a between-groups user study in order to evaluate the effectiveness, efficiency, and usability of the PERMITME tool in enhancing the developer's experience when deciding to include Android permissions in their mobile applications.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2014.0
2-s2.0-84922835662,Article,"Translating image tags at the image level to regions (i.e., tag-to-region assignment), which could play an important role in leveraging loosely-labeled training images for object classifier training, has become a popular research topic in the multimedia research community. In this paper, a novel two-stage multiple instance learning algorithm is presented for automatic tag-to-region assignment. The regions are generated by performing multiple-scale image segmentation and the instances with unique semantics are selected out from those regions by a random walk process. The affinity propagation (AP) clustering technique and Hausdorff distance are performed on the instances to identify the most positive instance and utilize it to initialize the maximum searching of Diverse Density likelihood in the first stage. In the second stage, the most contributive instance, which is chosen from each bag, is treated as the key instance for simplifying the computing procedure of Diverse Density likelihood. At last, an automatic method is proposed to discriminate the boundary between positive instances and negative instances. Our experiments on three well-known image sets have provided positive results.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2013.0

It enables radiation oncologists and planners to design treatment plans that maximally protect spinal cord while effectively controlling surrounding tumors. Spinal cord dose distribution is primarily affected by the shapes of tumor boundaries near the organ. In this work, we estimate such boundary effects and predict dose distribution by exploring an active optical flow model (AOFM). To establish AOFM, we collect a sequence of dose sub-images and tumor contours near spinal cords from a database of clinically accepted spine SBRT plans. The data are classified into five groups according to the tumor location in relation to the spinal cords. In each group, we randomly choose a dose sub-image as the reference and register all other dose images to the reference using an optical flow method. AOFM is then constructed by importing optical flow vectors and dose values into the principal component analysis. To develop the predictive model for a group, we also build active shape model (ASM) of tumor contours near the spinal cords. The correlation between ASM and AOFM is estimated via the multiple regression model. When predicting dose distribution of a new case, the group was first determined based on the case's tumor contour. Then the corresponding model for the group is used to map from the ASM space to the AOFM space. Finally, the parameters in the AOFM space are used to estimate dose distribution. This method was validated on 30 SBRT plans. Analysis of dose-volume histograms revealed that at the important 2 % volume mark, the dose difference between prediction and clinical plan is less than 4 %. These results suggest that the AOFM-based approach is a promising tool for predicting accurate spinal cord dose in clinical practice.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2015.0

We analyze longitudinal data from students who spent their academic careers in North Carolina public secondary schools and attended North Carolina public universities. Our results suggest that although the proportion of female math and science teachers at a school has no impact on male students, it has a powerful effect on female students' likelihood of declaring and graduating with a STEM degree, and effects are largest for female students with the highest math skills.

In this work, we present SilentSense, a framework to authenticate users silently and transparently by exploiting dynamics mined from the user touch behavior biometrics and the micro-movement of the device caused by user's screen-touch actions. We build a 'touch-based biometrics' model of the owner by extracting some principle features, and then verify whether the current user is the owner or guest/attacker. When using the smartphone, some unique operating dynamics of the user is detected and learnt by collecting the sensor data and touch events silently. When users are mobile, the micro-movement of mobile devices caused by touch is suppressed by that due to the large scale user-movement which will render the touch-based biometrics ineffective. To address this, we integrate a movement-based biometrics for each user with previous touch-based biometrics. We conduct extensive evaluations of our approaches on the Android smartphone, we show that the user identification accuracy is over 99%.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2015.0

Efficient message delivery in VANETs is still a very challenging research issue. In this paper, a Q-learning based routing protocol (i.e., QGrid) is introduced to help to improve the message delivery from mobile vehicles to a specific location. QGrid considers both macroscopic and microscopic aspects when making the routing decision, while the traditional routing methods focus on computing meeting information between different vehicles. QGrid divides the region into different grids. The macroscopic aspect determines the optimal next-hop grid and the microscopic aspect determines the specific vehicle in the optimal next-hop grid to be selected as next-hop vehicle. QGrid computes the Q-values of different movements between neighboring grids for a given destination via Q-learning. Each vehicle stores Q-value table learned offline, then selects optimal next-hop grid by querying Q-value table. Inside the selected next-hop grid, we either greedily select the nearest neighboring vehicle to the destination or select the neighboring vehicle with highest probability of moving to the optimal next-hop grid predicted by the two-order Markov chain. The performance of QGrid is evaluated by using real life trajectory GPS data of Shanghai taxies. Simulation comparison among QGrid and other existing position-based routing protocols confirms the advantages of proposed QGrid routing protocol for VANETs.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2015.0

Human detection accuracy is poor, often with no better than chance performance. In this investigation, we consider whether automated methods can produce better results and if emphasizing the possible disruption in interactional synchrony can signal whether an interactant is truthful or deceptive. We propose a data-driven and unobtrusive framework using visual cues that consists of face tracking, head movement detection, facial expression recognition, and interactional synchrony estimation. Analysis were conducted on 242 video samples from an experiment in which deceivers and truth-tellers interacted with professional interviewers either face-to-face or through computer mediation. Results revealed that the framework is able to automatically track head movements and expressions of both interlocutors to extract normalized meaningful synchrony features and to learn classification models for deception recognition.

A robust and precise segmentation would enable accurate, objective and consistent measurement of hepatic fat-fraction for disease quantification, therapy monitoring and drug development. However, segmenting the liver in clinical trials is a challenging task due to the variability of liver anatomy as well as the diverse sources the images were acquired from. In this paper, we propose an automated and robust framework for liver segmentation and assessment. It uses single statistical atlas registration to initialize a robust deformable model to obtain fine segmentation. Fat-fraction map is computed by using chemical shift based method in the delineated region of liver. This proposed method is validated on 14 abdominal magnetic resonance (MR) volumetric scans. The qualitative and quantitative comparisons show that our proposed method can achieve better segmentation accuracy with less variance comparing with two other atlas-based methods.

Can religious identification and participation create normative standards of behavior that either aid or hinder the development of human capital and either encourage or discourage its use to achieve financial success? These have been pressing questions since Max Weber first wrote The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism. Yet the contemporary transformation of class structure in postindustrial societies and the declining strength of traditional denominational differences (particularly Protestant–Catholic) raise these issues anew. The new occupational structure of service economies, the increasing importance of dual earners in households to achieve middle class housing and status, the crucial role of postsecondary education (both the type of institution and major) for occupational success, and the critical role of marriage and family postponement in achieving stable lucrative employment all point to new avenues through which religion might influence class location. Establishing a theory of causality, however, requires evidence that religious participation directly influences behavioral choices, rather than simply attracting people who have made similar life choices for disparate (nonreligious) reasons together in congregations. In this chapter, we review the existence of class-based differences in religious preferences and participation, and we theorize that these differences are not just the epiphenomenon of class-based religious “tastes” but are mechanisms through which class is constructed and reconstructed across generations.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Sociology,2012.0

This person × situation framework has stimulated a great deal of research and had considerable heuristic value for social and personality psychologists who study the self and identity. However, because it views both the person and the situation as static rather than the result of dynamic processes, it fails to account for how people and situations mutually create each other in a process that unfolds over time. Through dynamic processes of reciprocal influence between persons and situations, self and identity can change surprisingly rapidly-change sustained by the situations people create for themselves over time.

Findings - The theoretical model suggests that the credence good nature of un-monitored environmental claims prohibits consumer validation; firms have an incentive to advertise green but no incentive to adopt best environmental practice. Third-party monitoring transforms the game, making eco-friendly outcomes possible.

Although we understand that after a sprain, scar tissue forms within the ligament, little is known about the morphologic changes in a ligament after injury. Objective: To examine whether morphologic differences exist in the thickness of the ATFL in healthy, coper, and unstable-ankle groups. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Laboratory. Patients or Other Participants: A total of 80 National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I collegiate athletes (43 women, 37 men, age14/18.2 6 1.1 years, height1/4175.8 6 11.1 cm, body mass1/475.0 6 16.9 kg) participated in this study. They were categorized into the healthy, coper, or unstable group by history of ankle sprains and score on the Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool. Main Outcome Measure(s): A musculoskeletal sonographic image of the ATFL was obtained from each ankle. Thickness of the ATFL was measured at the midpoint of the ligament between the attachments on the lateral malleolus and talus. Results: A group-by-limb interaction was evident (P.038). The ATFLs of the injured limb for the coper group (2.20 6 0.47 mm) and the injured limb for the unstable group (2.28 6 0.53 mm) were thicker than the ATFL of the ""injured"" limb of the healthy group (1.95 6 0.29 mm) at P 1/4 .015 and P 1/4 .015, respectively. No differences were seen in the uninjured limbs among groups. Conclusions: Because ATFL thicknesses of the healthy group's uninjured ankles were similar, we contend that lasting morphologic changes occurred in those with a previous injury to the ankle. Similar differences were seen between the injured limbs of the coper and unstable groups, so there must be another explanation for the sensations of instability and the reinjuries in the unstable group.",CHHS,Kinesiology,2015.0

Power users are those individuals that are able to exert substantial influence over the recommendations made to other users, and RS operators encourage the existence of power user communities and leverage them to help fellow users make informed purchase decisions, especially on new items. Attacks on RSs occur when malicious users attempt to bias recommendations by introducing fake reviews or ratings; these attacks remain a key problem area for system operators. Thus, the influence wielded by power users can be used for both positive (addressing the ""new item"" problem) or negative (attack) purposes. Our research is investigating the impact on RS predictions and top-N recommendation lists when attackers emulate power users to provide biased ratings for new items. Previously we showed that power user attacks are effective against user-based CF RSs and that item-based CF RSs are robust to this type of attack.

A number of software and computational methods have been developed for detecting AS. Most of the methods, however, are designed and tested on animal data, such as human and mouse. Plants genes differ from those of animals in many ways, e.g., the average intron size and preferred AS types. These differences may require different computational approaches and raise questions about their effectiveness on plant data. The goal of this paper is to benchmark existing computational differential splicing (or transcription) detection methods so that biologists can choose the most suitable tools to accomplish their goals. Results: This study compares the eight popular public available software packages for differential splicing analysis using both simulated and real Arabidopsis thaliana RNA-seq data. All software are freely available. The study examines the effect of varying AS ratio, read depth, dispersion pattern, AS types, sample sizes and the influence of annotation. Using a real data, the study looks at the consistences between the packages and verifies a subset of the detected AS events using PCR studies. Conclusions: No single method performs the best in all situations. The accuracy of annotation has a major impact on which method should be chosen for AS analysis. DEXSeq performs well in the simulated data when the AS signal is relative strong and annotation is accurate. Cufflinks achieve a better tradeoff between precision and recall and turns out to be the best one when incomplete annotation is provided. Some methods perform inconsistently for different AS types.

Results: Posttraumatic stress and depression were negatively related to QoL. PTG was not significantly related to QoL in a bivariate analysis. However, considerable interaction effects were found. Six years after the tsunami, high levels of posttraumatic stress were related to lower QoL in those participants with low levels of PTG, whereas lower levels of depression were related to higher QoL in those participants with high levels of PTG.

DAT1, a polymorphic dopamine transporter gene, is one such factor that may be responsible for differential susceptibility to cumulative life pressures. Data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health were utilized to determine whether adolescents with the 10-repeat allele are more likely to respond to life stresses by engaging in alcohol use than those without the allele. Respondents’ self-reports of key stressors were used to create a composite life stress scale. The interaction of this measure with the number of 10-repeat DAT1 alleles was evaluated in series of logistic regression models. A significant interaction emerged between stressful life experiences and DAT1 for alcohol use among females, but this pattern was not seen in males. Females with the 10-repeat allele appear to be more sensitive to life stress as compared to those without the allele. It appears that variation in the DAT1 gene may help explain why some women are more likely to consume alcohol when confronted with stress.

Although the knowledge of CREs and CRMs in a genome is crucial to elucidate gene regulatory networks and understand many important biological phenomena, little is known about the CREs and CRMs in most eukaryotic genomes due to the difficulty to characterize them by either computational or traditional experimental methods. However, the exponentially increasing number of TF binding location data produced by the recent wide adaptation of chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with microarray hybridization (ChIP-chip) or high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) technologies has provided an unprecedented opportunity to identify CRMs and CREs in genomes. Nonetheless, how to effectively mine these large volumes of ChIP data to identify CREs and CRMs at nucleotide resolution is a highly challenging task. Results: We have developed a novel graph-theoretic based algorithm DePCRM for genome-wide de novo predictions of CREs and CRMs using a large number of ChIP datasets. DePCRM predicts CREs and CRMs by identifying overrepresented combinatorial CRE motif patterns in multiple ChIP datasets in an effective way. When applied to 168 ChIP datasets of 56 TFs from D. melanogaster, DePCRM identified 184 and 746 overrepresented CRE motifs and their combinatorial patterns, respectively, and predicted a total of 115,932 CRMs in the genome. The predictions recover 77.9% of known CRMs in the datasets and 89.3% of known CRMs containing at least one predicted CRE. We found that the putative CRMs as well as CREs as a whole in a CRM are more conserved than randomly selected sequences. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the CRMs predicted by DePCRM are highly likely to be functional. Our algorithm is the first of its kind for de novo genome-wide prediction of CREs and CRMs using larger number of transcription factor ChIP datasets. The algorithm and predictions will hopefully facilitate the elucidation of gene regulatory networks in eukaryotes.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2014.0

2-s2.0-84924598451,Article,"Recently two lines of image retrieval algorithms demonstrate excellent scalability: 1) local features indexed by a vocabulary tree, and 2) holistic features indexed by compact hashing codes. Although both of them are able to search visually similar imageseffectively, their retrieval precision may vary dramatically among queries. Therefore, combining these two types of methods is expected to further enhance the retrieval precision. However, the feature characteristics and the algorithmic procedures of these methods are dramatically different, which is very challenging for the feature-level fusion. This motivates us to investigate how to fuse the ordered retrieval sets, i.e., the ranks of images, given by multiple retrieval methods, to boost the retrieval precision without sacrificing theirscalability. In this paper, we model retrieval ranks as graphs of candidate images and propose a graph-based query specific fusion approach, where multiple graphs are merged and reranked by conducting a link analysis on a fused graph. The retrieval quality of an individual method is measured on-the-fly by assessing the consistency of the top candidates' nearest neighborhoods. Hence, it iscapable of adaptively integrating the strengths of the retrieval methods using local or holistic features for different query images. This proposed method does not need any supervision, has few parameters, and is easy to implement. Extensive and thorough experiments have been conducted on four public datasets, i.e., the UKbench, Corel-5K, Holidays and the large-scale San Francisco Landmarks datasets. Our proposed method has achieved very competitive performance, including state-of-the-art results on several data sets, e.g., the N-S score 3.83 for UKbench.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2015.0

We therefore compared the effects of moderate- and low-intensity IET programmes on resting blood pressure. Forty normotensive participants (22.3 ± 3.4 years; 69.5 ± 15.5 kg; 170.2 ± 8.7 cm) were randomly assigned to groups of differing training intensities [20%EMGpeak (~23%MVC, maximum voluntary contraction, or 30%EMGpeak (~34%MVC)] or control group; 3 weeks of IET at 30%EMGpeak resulted in significant reductions in resting mean arterial pressure (e.g. −3.9 ± 1.0 mmHg, P &lt; 0.001), whereas 20%EMGpeak did not (−2.3 ± 2.9 mmHg; P &gt; 0.05). Moreover, after pooling all female versus male participants, IET induced a 6.9-mmHg reduction in systolic blood pressure in female participants, but only a 1.5-mmHg reduction in systolic blood pressure in male participants, although the difference was not significant. An IET intensity between 20%EMGpeak and 30%EMGpeak is sufficient to elicit significant resting blood pressure reductions in a short-term training period (3 weeks). In addition, sexual dimorphism may exist in the magnitude of reductions, but further work is required to confirm this possibility, which could be important in understanding the mechanisms responsible.",CHHS,Kinesiology,2015.0

Few studies have examined the effect of postoperative delirium on outcomes after cardiac surgery. Objectives: To assess the relationship between delirium after cardiac surgery and the following outcomes: length of stay after surgery, prevalence of falls, discharge to a nursing facility, discharge to home with home health services, and use of inpatient physical therapy. Methods: Electronic medical records of 656 cardiac surgery patients were reviewed retrospectively. Results: Postoperative delirium occurred in 161 patients (24.5%). Patients with postoperative delirium had significantly longer stays (P< .001) and greater prevalence of falls (P< .001) than did patients without delirium. Patients with delirium also had a significantly greater likelihood for discharge to a nursing facility (P< .001) and need for home health services if discharged to home (P< .001) and a significantly higher need for inpatient physical therapy (P< .001). Compared with patients without postoperative delirium, patients who had this complication were more likely to have received zolpidem and benzodiazepines postoperatively and to have a history of arrhythmias, renal disease, and congestive heart failure. Conclusions: Patients who have delirium after cardiac surgery have poorer outcomes than do similar patients without this complication.

A geospatial method is proposed to extract FCNLs from people's moving trajectories based on the street network. Two groups of quantitative indices are introduced to measure the evolution of the spatial extent and temporal variation patterns of different criticality levels of FCNLs.

2-s2.0-84925240699,Article,"Background/Context: Schools are integral to augmenting and diversifying the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce. This is because K-12 schools can inspire and reinforce students' interest in STEM, in addition to academically preparing them to pursue a STEM career. Previous literature emphasizes the importance of highquality STEM academic preparation in high school and the role of informal and formal exposure to STEM as important influences on students' chances of following a STEM career. Interestingly, although many students decide to major in STEM fields while they are in high school, the majority of the extant literature about why students choose STEM majors primarily focuses on students' experiences during the college years. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: Through our research, we seek to investigate how learning experiences of inspiration/reinforcement/preparation toward STEM that students have during high school can help explain the stark differences in STEM involvement by gender and ethnicity. We first investigate the importance of high school inspirational/ reinforcing/ preparatory experiences for students' intent to major in STEM while in high school. We then see how they relate to students' actual choice of a STEM major. We do this focusing on gender and racial/ethnic differences in outcomes. Specifically, we analyze the impact of the timing of high school STEM courses (algebra, biology, and physics), the quantity of STEM-related classes, and the quality of these courses on students' decision to pursue a college STEM major. Research Design: This is an analysis of quantitative data gathered about members of North Carolina's 2004 high school graduating class who also matriculated to one of the 16 campuses of the University of North Carolina system. Our research developed in two different stages. In the first stage, we utilize multilevel binomial models to examine students' intent to declare a STEM major in their senior year of high school. In the second stage, we employ multilevel multinomial models to analyze chances of declaring a STEM major during the years 2005-2011, when students are in college. Findings/Results: Findings suggest that STEM experiences of inspiration/reinforcement/ preparation during high school interact with demographic variables to moderate students' interest in STEM. Taking physics and intending to major in STEM during high school are the variables most closely associated with students' choice of STEM as a major. In addition, taking physics is especially important for young women's odds of declaration of STEM. Conclusions/Recommendations: Findings suggest several policy recommendations: Provide a variety of high school learning STEM experiences that will link and augment students' interest in STEM; change the way physics is presented to female students; utilizing curricula and pedagogy that focus on ways that physics is personally relevant may increase the number of young women who take the course in high school; increase the quality of the STEM-related academic preparation of students; particular attention should be given to underrepresented subgroups of students; increase the offering of math and science-focused program at schools; and increase the availability of more STEM-related co- and extracurricular experiences available to youth.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Sociology,2015.0

2-s2.0-84925327886,Article,"Introduction: Chronic heavy alcohol use is an independent risk factor for developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Sirtuin-1 (Sirt1) is a NAD+-dependent deacetylase implicated in alcohol-induced liver injury and overexpressed in human HCC. The aims of this study were to investigate Sirt1 expression in mouse models of HCC and chronic EtOH-feeding, and in human HCC cells expressing alcohol metabolizing enzymes. Methods: C57BL/6 and B6C3 mice were injected with DEN and randomized to receive drinking water (DW) or EtOH-DW for 8 weeks at 36 weeks. Livers were analyzed for HCC incidence, size, and Sirt1 expression. In parallel, human HepG2 cells or HepG2 cells transfected to express ADH and CYP2E1 (VL-17a cells) were treated with alcohol (0-50 mM) and/or CAY10591 (Sirt1 activator) or EX-527 (Sirt1 inhibitor). Results: B6C3 mice exhibited significantly elevated Sirt-1 expression vs. C57BL/6 mice and Sirt-1 expression was elevated in HCC vs. non-tumor liver. However, EtOH-feeding did not further affect Sirt1 expression in mice of either background despite EtOH increasing HCC size and incidence in B6C3 mice. In vitro, EtOH treatment significantly decreased Sirt1 expression in VL-17a-cells and stimulated cell growth, an effect not observed in HepG2 cells. The effects of ethanol on VL-17a cells were abrogated by pretreatment with CAY10591. Conclusions: Sirt1 expression correlates with susceptibility to form HCC, but is not further affected by alcohol feeding. Conversely Sirt1 expression and function is impacted by alcohol metabolism capacity in human HCC cells in vitro. These discrepancies in Sirt1-expression-function may reflect differences in enzyme expression compared to activity, or more complex changes in genes targeted for deacetylation during tumor progression in the setting of chronic alcohol ingestion.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2015.0

For two decades, isometric exercise training (IET) has become established as effective at reducing in resting BP (RBP) in a short period (4-10 weeks). The most common IET modes have comprised isometric handgrip (IHG) or isometric bilateral leg (IBL) training and 4×2-min contractions at ∼20-50% maximal voluntary contraction with 1-5-min rest between. Although this type of exercise training could have important implications, for hypertensive patients and in preventing hypertension development, little is known about the mechanisms responsible for IET-induced RBP reductions. This uncertainty derives from a lack of understanding concerning the most effective IET programs for specific populations. Possible influential factors and mechanisms include age, sex, pre-existing disease and medication, and IET-induced adaptations in the exercising muscle and nervous system, which are discussed in this review. Designing effective IET programs may involve manipulation of exercise intensity, frequency, duration and mode, as well as consideration of yet discovered mechanisms for RBP reductions.

However, due to the frequency of occlusions (due to interactions) and similarity in appearance and motion features, tracking could easily drift to the incorrect object as the affinity model is unable to discern between similar objects. Recently, a method to filter incorrect associations based on areas of occlusion was proposed. This method only filtered based on entrance and exit within a specific occlusion. In this paper, we propose to improve the tracking of multiple insects involving frequent occlusion by modeling the paths of possible movement within the occlusion tunnel which we call occlusion sub-tunnels. Using two datasets consisting of ants and termites, we demonstrate that the method filters 8% more incorrect associations on average resulting in a reduction of ID switches by 19% over all datasets.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2015.0

Highly adaptable, this newcomer’s success causes conflicts with residents, necessitating research to understand the distribution of coyotes in urban landscapes. Citizen science can be a powerful approach toward this aim. However, to date, the few studies that have used publicly reported coyote sighting data have lacked an in-depth consideration of human socioeconomic variables, which we suggest are an important source of overlooked variation in data that describe the simultaneous occurrence of coyotes and humans. We explored the relative importance of socioeconomic variables compared to those describing coyote habitat in predicting human–coyote encounters in highly-urbanized Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, USA using 707 public reports of coyote sightings, high-resolution land cover, US Census data, and an autologistic multi-model inference approach. Three of the four socioeconomic variables which we hypothesized would have an important influence on encounter probability, namely building density, household income, and occupation, had effects at least as large as or larger than coyote habitat variables. Our results indicate that the consideration of readily available socioeconomic variables in the analysis of citizen science data improves the prediction of species distributions by providing insight into the effects of important factors for which data are often lacking, such as resource availability for coyotes on private property and observer experience.

Understanding how to prevent CAI is difficult because of the costs and logistics associated with clinical trials aimed at preventing the heterogeneous symptoms associated with CAI. Thus, a need exists to develop an animal model that presents similar long-term consequences as CAI to assess preclinical data. Thus, the purpose was to determine whether surgically transecting the lateral ligaments of a mouse hind limb results in the development of CAI-like symptoms 12 months after injury. Methods: Thirty male mice (CBA/J) were randomly placed into a SHAM (control), CFL (calcaneofibular ligament; mild ankle sprain), or ATFL/CFL (anterior talofibular ligament/ CFL; severe) ankle sprain group and housed individually. Three days after surgically transecting the respective lateral ligaments, mice were given a solid surface running wheel and daily running wheel measurements were recorded. Outcome measures of balance and gait were obtained before and at 4, 48, 54, and 60 wk after injury. Results: The ATFL/CFL group had significantly more hind foot slips than the CFL and SHAM groups (P G 0.05). The CFL also had more hind foot slips relative to the SHAM group (P G 0.05).

We suggest that Martian directional cracking occurs due to the preferential propagation of microfractures favourably oriented with respect to repeating geometries of diurnal peaks in sun-induced thermal stresses. A numerical model modified here with Mars parameters supports this hypothesis both with respect to the overall magnitude of stresses as well as to the times of day at which the stresses peak.

The purpose of this exploratory study is to examine dual HIV risk by 3 different mental health problems (depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD]) among drug-using women in rural jails. Method: This study involved random selection, screening, and face-to-face interviews with 136 women in 1 Appalachian state. Analyses focused on the relationship between mental health and HIV risk. Results: Nearly 80% of women self-reported symptoms of depression, and more than 60% endorsed symptoms consistent with anxiety and PTSD symptoms. Mental health significantly correlated with severity of certain types of drug use, as well as risky sexual activity. In addition, for women experiencing anxiety and PTSD, injection drug use moderated the relationship between mental health and risky sexual activity. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: Based on these rates of drug use, mental health problems, and the emergence of injection drug use in rural Appalachia, the need to explore the relationships between these issues among vulnerable and understudied populations, such as rural women, is critical.

2-s2.0-84925784711,Article,"Despite evidence that men are typically perceived as more appropriate and effective than women in leadership positions, a recent debate has emerged in the popular press and academic literature over the potential existence of a female leadership advantage. This meta-analysis addresses this debate by quantitatively summarizing gender differences in perceptions of leadership effectiveness across 99 independent samples from 95 studies. Results show that when all leadership contexts are considered, men and women do not differ in perceived leadership effectiveness. Yet, when other-ratings only are examined, women are rated as significantly more effective than men. In contrast, when self-ratings only are examined, men rate themselves as significantly more effective than women rate themselves. Additionally, this synthesis examines the influence of contextual moderators developed from role congruity theory (Eagly & Karau, 2002). Our findings help to extend role congruity theory by demonstrating how it can be supplemented based on other theories in the literature, as well as how the theory can be applied to both female and male leaders.",Business,Management,2014.0

A project needs to be developed in minimum time by optimally choosing the proportion of effort allocated towards design activities. We first consider a local case, where the benefits of design activities are restricted within the project. Here the optimal policy follows a bang-bang structure: invest fully in design followed by investing fully in implementation. Next we consider two sequentially linked projects where design capital built in the first project can be reused by the downstream project. For the two project case, the design investment in the upstream project first increases and then decreases with the ability to utilize design capital accumulated in the first project for the second project. We also propose a coordination scheme that rewards the upstream project team so that design investment in this project is chosen in a globally optimal manner.",Business,BISOM,2015.0
2-s2.0-84925857243,Article,"Asian Americans suffer from childhood obesity yet are a particularly understudied population. Objective was to examine the impact of ethnicity on child feeding practices believed to be associated with childhood obesity in a community sample of mothers and their children. Prior research with White samples indicates a positive relationship between parental overcontrol of child feeding and child adiposity. Participants were 425 mothers (66 Asian/Asian American, 218 Hispanic/Latino, 26 Black/African American, 115 White/Caucasian) with children between the ages of 2 and 11. Participants provided demographic and height and weight information, and completed the Child Feeding Questionnaire (CFQ). Analyses focused on associations between ethnicity, parental feeding attitudes (factors of the CFQ) and child Body Mass Index (BMI). Results indicated significant ethnicity by CFQ factor interactions for 2 of the 6 CFQ factors examined (pressure to eat and restriction). Post hoc tests demonstrated that for these 2 CFQ factors, there was a significant association between child BMI and the CFQ factor score only within the Asian group; among Asians, for each of these 2 CFQ factors, children from families with above-median factor scores had significantly lower BMI (p < .05). As predicted, for Asian Americans there was an inverse relationship between mothers' control of feeding and child BMI. These findings suggest that lower levels of parental control over feeding may contribute to childhood obesity in Asian populations. The relationship between parental control over eating and child BMI found in middle-class White families does not generalize to populations with diverse ethnic or socioeconomic backgrounds.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Psychology,2014.0
2-s2.0-84925881240,Article,"In this position paper, we submit a synthesis of theoretical models based on physiology, non-equilibrium thermodynamics, and non-linear time-series analysis. Based on an understanding of the human organism as a system of interconnected complex adaptive systems, we seek to examine the relationship between health, complexity, variability, and entropy production, as it might be useful to help understand aging, and improve care for patients. We observe the trajectory of life is characterized by the growth, plateauing and subsequent loss of adaptive function of organ systems, associated with loss of functioning and coordination of systems. Understanding development and aging requires the examination of interdependence among these organ systems. Increasing evidence suggests network interconnectedness and complexity can be captured/measured/associated with the degree and complexity of healthy biologic rhythm variability (e.g., heart and respiratory rate variability). We review physiological mechanisms linking the omics, arousal/stress systems, immune function, and mitochondrial bioenergetics; highlighting their interdependence in normal physiological function and aging. We argue that aging, known to be characterized by a loss of variability, is manifested at multiple scales, within functional units at the small scale, and reflected by diagnostic features at the larger scale. While still controversial and under investigation, it appears conceivable that the integrity of whole body complexity may be, at least partially, reflected in the degree and variability of intrinsic biologic rhythms, which we believe are related to overall system complexity that may be a defining feature of health and it's loss through aging. Harnessing this information for the development of therapeutic and preventative strategies may hold an opportunity to significantly improve the health of our patients across the trajectory of life.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Psychology,2015.0

Illustrating one aspect of a secondary education teacher preparation program, authors consider how clinical partnerships can be designed in light of these standards to have a positive impact on P-12 student learning. Focusing on the program evaluation framework, authors describe a spectrum of diverse formative and summative growth measures that document the scope of impact for all stakeholders, including students. In light of the Feuer, Floden, Chudowsky, and Ahn (2013) questioning framework, authors assess program outcomes. In closing, the authors (a) conclude that comprehensive evaluation models are needed to document complex outcomes, which will make program impact more visible and measureable; (b) recommend using the Feuer et al. decision-making framework to initiate and guide programmatic design and evaluation model development; and (c) affirm CAEP's expectations—clinical partnerships go beyond positive relationships, coselection of mentor teachers and candidates, and commitment to diverse settings to ensuring P-12 student achievement—as attainable goals for educator preparation accreditation.",Education,"Middle, Secondary, and K-12 Education",2014.0
2-s2.0-84925946622,Article,"Aim: To examine the effect of lifelong physical activity on the development of knee osteoarthritis (OA). Methods: Fifteen C57Bl/6J mice (8 male and 7 female) were individually caged with a running wheel, magnetic sensor and digital odometer, and 15 mice (7 male and 8 female) were individually housed without a running wheel. Each mouse was provided with standard chow and water ad libitum. Running wheel distance, duration and speed were recorded daily. A diagnostic ultrasound (SONOS 5500 Ultrasound and 15-6L ultrasound probe) was used to measure medial and lateral knee joint space in both hind limbs every month until the end of the mice's lifespans. Results: Right medial (P = 0.002), right lateral (P < 0.0001), left medial (P = 0.01), and left lateral (P = 0.007) knee joint spaces were significantly larger from months 3 to 12 in the physically active C57Bl/6J mice. However, there was no significant difference between all knee joint spaces of the running and sedentary C57Bl/6J mice throughout the remainder of the lifespan. All hindlimb knee joint spaces significantly declined with aging (P < 0.0001). Conclusions: During the first 12 months of the lifespan, physical activity seemed to protect the joint from degeneration; however; after that there was no protective benefit. This may be due to the fact that C57Bl/6J mice are genetically known to develop OA at 9 months of age. Physical activity may have no impact on this genetic predisposition. Further study in mice not genetically predisposed to develop OA is needed.",CHHS,Kinesiology,2015.0

How surgery and post-operative rehabilitation influence muscle activation during walking early after surgery is unclear. Purpose: Examine muscle strength and activation during walking before and one and 6-months post-TKA. Methods: Ten patients (n=6 female age: 64.7±7.9years; body mass index[BMI]:29.2±2.5kg/m2) and 10 healthy adults (n=6 female age: 60.6±7.4years; BMI: 25.5±4.0kg/m2) participated. The patients underwent bilateral quadriceps and hamstrings strength testing and assessment of quadriceps/hamstrings co-activation and on/off timing using surface electromyography during a six-minute walk test (6MW). Groups, limbs, and changes with TKA surgery were compared. Results: Patients reported greater 6MW knee pain pre- versus post-TKA and compared to controls (P< 0.05). Patients had weaker surgical limb hamstrings (P< 0.05) and bilateral quadriceps (P< 0.05) strength than controls pre- and post-TKA. Before and 1-month post-TKA, patients had side-to-side differences in quadriceps and hamstrings strength (P< 0.05). Controls walked farther than patients (P< 0.01). Patients demonstrated greater surgical limb co-activation pre-operatively than controls (P< 0.05). Co-activation was higher bilaterally one-month post-TKA compared to controls (P< 0.05). Patients turned off their quadriceps later during stance than controls before and 1-month post-TKA (P< 0.05). Conclusions: Muscle strength, co-activation, and timing differed between patients and controls before and early after surgery.

This framework includes three modules: (1) a data distribution module, (2) a data transformation module, and (3) a high performance I/O module. Specifically, we first design a two-step consistent hashing algorithm, which takes into account load balancing, data locality, and scalability, for a data distribution module. In the data transformation module, we present a parallel strategy of a linear referencing algorithm with reduced subtask coupling, easy-implemented parallelization, and low communication cost. Moreover, we propose a compression-aware I/O module to improve the processing efficiency. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation on a synthetic dataset (1.114.

2-s2.0-84926453498,Conference Paper,"Rationale: Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are widely used in the management of asthma. Prior research suggests that access to ICS among patients with asthma may vary by ethnicity. Objectives: Study objectives were to determine if there is a difference in the proportion of Hispanic and non-Hispanic white patients with asthma in the receipt of an ICS prescription and to determine independent predictors for the receipt of an ICS prescription for asthma. Methods: The 2009 U.S. Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data were used to compare the receipt of ICS prescription among patients with asthma with the following inclusion criteria: Hispanic and non-Hispanic white ethnicity, age over 4 years, and diagnostic codes for asthma. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine the influence of race/ethnicity and other significant factors on the receipt of an ICS prescription. Measurements and Main Results: There were 1,469 patients with asthma, corresponding to a weighted sample of 14,401,069 U.S. patients with asthma who met the inclusion criteria, represented by 16.1% Hispanic, 59.5% female, and mean age of 39.9 years. Among non-Hispanic white patients with asthma, 39.7% (35% children and 41% adults) had a receipt of an ICS prescription compared with 22.2% of Hispanic patients (23.9% children and 21.2% adults); P<0.001. In the multiple regression model, Hispanic patients aged 18 years or older had 43% lower odds (odds ratio, 0.6; 95% confidence interval, 0.3-0.9) of having a receipt of an ICS prescription compared with non-Hispanic white patients, independent of other factors. There was no significant difference in receipt of an ICS prescription between Hispanic and non-Hispanic white children with asthma (aged 4-17 yr). Conclusions: The disparity in the receipt of ICS prescription between Hispanic and non-Hispanic white adult patients with asthma could result in suboptimal asthma management, a higher rate of exacerbations, and higher health care costs in this growing minority population. The differences and potential disparities in the receipt of an ICS prescription between Hispanic and non-Hispanic white patients with asthma warrant further investigation to better understand the reasons for such disparities, along with their impact on the U.S. health care burden and interventions that can be undertaken to reduce these disparities.",CHHS,Public Health,2015.0
2-s2.0-84926466977,Article,"Purpose – This paper aims to progress the dialogue on language rights in the urban classroom. Research has evidenced how language can serve as a powerful tool in mainstream ideologies; more specifically, the preferred and dominant use of Standard Written English in the American classroom has demonstrated how language serves as a gatekeeper for student success. This paper calls for a more democratic notion of language usage that denies the “gatekeeper” of English into specific educational tracks. Design/methodology/approach – By framing the issue of linguistic diversity through a theoretical analysis of cultural reproduction theory, this paper demonstrates how language serves as a bridge in building and negotiating cultural identities for students. In addition, an examination of how language serves as a stratification tool in educational contexts provides credence for reform initiatives. Findings – In the field of linguistics, the shift in verbal and language repertoires has provided a new paradigm for rethinking what constitutes as an acceptable and innovative language use. However, structures such as schools have remained static in their vision of linguistic success in the classroom, assessing students’ language abilities in the specifics of standard written English.

It leads to a less-conservative condition for robust stability and a new robust controller for the general uncertain stochastic systems via linear matrix inequality (LMI) forms. The system states are able to reach the SMC switching surface as guaranteed in probability 1.

2-s2.0-84926651372,Article,"A network perspective has increasingly become an organizational paradigm for understanding regional spatial structures. Based on a critical overview of existing empirical models for estimating intercity networks based on firm linkages, this study extends the recently proposed regional corporate city model algorithm by proposing a new method for approximating urban networks based on the locational strategies of firms. The new method considers both regional and hierarchical network features and avoids the information loss associated with the conversion from two-mode firm-city networks to one-mode city-city networks. In addition, networks estimated by using the method proposed herein are suitable when employing social network analysis. Finally, this method is empirically validated by examining intercity firm networks formed by advanced producer services firms in China’s two largest metropolitan areas, namely the Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta. The presented empirical analysis suggests two main findings. First, in contrast to conventional methods (e.g., the interlocking city network model), our new method produces regional and hierarchical urban networks that more closely resemble reality. Second, the new method allows us to use social network analysis to assess betweenness and closeness centralities. However, regardless of the model applied, the validity of any method that measures urban networks depends on the soundness of its underlying assumptions about how network actors (firms, in our case) interact.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2015.0

Both experiments used a repetition priming paradigm, but Experiment 1 studied priming effects with a task that required a superordinate categorization response (man-made or natural), while Experiment 2 used a lower level category response (musical instruments or animal): one that was more closely associated with the basic level of the semantic network. Results from Experiment 1 showed a strong effect of target modality and two distinct patterns of conceptual priming effects with picture and environmental sound targets. However, no priming advantage was found when congruent and incongruent primes were compared. Results from Experiment 2, found congruency effects that were specific to environmental sound targets when preceded by picture primes. The findings provide support for the intermodal event file and multisensory framework, and suggest that auditory and visual features about a single item in a conceptual category may be more tightly connected than two different items from the same category.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Psychology,2015.0

A key question is what the family firm is worth without the family as part of the business. We provide a buyers' perspective on the valuation of the family firm and argue that prior family involvement provides the PE buyer with a distinct landscape of real options that require consideration. While the buyer gains real options for external (economic) value creation as a result of family departure, family exit after the sale triggers a loss of family dependent real options, which may subsequently reduce economic value for the new owner. Consequently, these two opposing effects need to be considered when accounting for the central role of the family and whether these effects result in an increased or decreased valuation of family firms.",Business,Management,2014.0

The work will facilitate genetic and evolutionary studies inBrassicaceae. Abstract: A broccoli population, VI-158 × BNC, consisting of 150 F2:3 families was used to create a saturated Brassica oleracea (diploid: CC) linkage map using a recently developed rapeseed (Brassica napus) (tetraploid: AACC) Illumina Infinium single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array. The map consisted of 547 non-redundant SNP markers spanning 948.1 cM across nine chromosomes with an average interval size of 1.7 cM. As the SNPs are anchored to the genomic reference sequence of the rapid cycling B. oleracea TO1000, we were able to estimate that the map provides 96 % coverage of the diploid genome. Carotenoid analysis of 2 years data identified 3 QTLs on two chromosomes that are associated with up to half of the phenotypic variation associated with the accumulation of total or individual compounds. By searching the genome sequences of the two related diploid species (B. oleracea and B. rapa), we further identified putative carotenoid candidate genes in the region of these QTLs. This is the first description of the use of a B. napus SNP array to rapidly construct high-density genetic linkage maps of one of the constituent diploid species. The unambiguous nature of these markers with regard to genomic sequences provides evidence to the nature of genes underlying the QTL, and demonstrates the value and impact this resource will have on Brassica research.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2014.0

The majority of CIT research is based on perceived benefits of this approach. Most of the goals of CIT programs are readily amenable to empirical study, yet there are few outcome evaluations of the programs. The purpose of this paper is to examine why empirical studies examining the effectiveness of CIT programs are nominal. Design/methodology/approach – Structural and practical impediments to the collection of empirical data for CIT programs were identified through including examinations of the types of data routinely collected, interviews with CIT participants, and the researchers’ own observations of hindrances to the data collection processes. By triangulating these methods, the authors were able to observe a number of impediments to the collection of empirical data on this topic. Findings – The multi-jurisdictional CIT program under review had several data problems. First, there was a lack of official data concerning CIT calls. Second, it was virtually impossible to follow a person with mental illness throughout the system from first contact to final disposition. Third, data sharing was hindered by a lack of memorandums of understanding. Fourth, important information was not being properly recorded.

It enables radiation oncologists and planners to design treatment plans that maximally protect spinal cord while effectively controlling surrounding tumors. Spinal cord dose distribution is primarily affected by the shapes of tumor boundaries near the organ. In this work, we estimate such boundary effects and predict dose distribution by exploring an active optical flow model (AOFM). To establish AOFM, we collect a sequence of dose sub-images and tumor contours near spinal cords from a database of clinically accepted spine SBRT plans. The data are classified into five groups according to the tumor location in relation to the spinal cords. In each group, we randomly choose a dose sub-image as the reference and register all other dose images to the reference using an optical flowmethod. AOFM is then constructed by importing optical flow vectors and dose values into the principal component analysis. To develop the predictivemodel for a group, we also build active shape model (ASM) of tumor contours near the spinal cords. The correlation between ASM and AOFM is estimated via the multiple regression model. When predicting dose distribution of a new case, the group was first determined based on the case’stumor contour. Then the corresponding model for the group is used to map from the ASM space to the AOFM space. Finally, the parameters in the AOFM space are used to estimate dose distribution. This method was validated on 30 SBRT plans. Analysis of dose-volume histograms revealed that at the important 2%volume mark, the dose difference between prediction and clinical plan is less than 4%. These results suggest that theAOFM-based approach is a promising tool for predicting accurate spinal cord dose in clinical practice.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2015.0

Meetings are a workplace activity that deserves increased attention from researchers and practitioners. Previous researchers attempted to develop typologies of meeting purpose with limited success. Through a comparison of classification methodologies, the authors consider a taxonomy as the appropriate classification scheme for meeting purpose. The authors then utilize the developed taxonomy to investigate the frequency with which a representative sample of working adults engaged in meetings of these varying purposes. Their proposed taxonomy provides relevant classifications for future research on meetings as well and serves as a useful tool for managers seeking to use and evaluate the effectiveness of meetings within their organizations. Design/methodology/approach – This study employs an inductive methodology using discourse analysis of qualitative meeting descriptions to develop a taxonomy of meeting purpose. The authors discourse analysis utilizes open-ended survey responses from a sample of working adults (n = 491). Findings – The authors categorical analysis of open-ended questions resulted in a 16-category taxonomy of meeting purpose. The two most prevalent meeting purpose categories in this sample were “to discuss ongoing projects” at 11.6 per cent and “to routinely discuss the state of the business” at 10.8 per cent. The two least common meeting purpose categories in this sample were “to brainstorm for ideas or solutions” at 3.3 per cent and “to discuss productivity and efficiencies” at 3.7 per cent. The taxonomy was analyzed across organizational type and employee job level to identify differences between those important organizational and employee characteristics. Research limitations/implications – The data suggested that meetings were institutionalized in organizations, making them useful at identifying differences between organizations as well as differences in employees in terms of scope of responsibility. Researchers and managers should consider the purposes for which they call meetings and how that manifests their overarching organizational focus, structure and goals Originality/value – This is the first study to overtly attempt to categorize the various purposes for which meetings are held.

To address the limitations of online instruction, while still incorporating its associated strengths, the development and implementation of hybridized methodology coursework have been proposed. Following this recommendation, the researchers developed and implemented hybridized L2 methodology courses that mirrored their pre-existing online and F2F equivalents. Using a mixed methodology, the researchers then conducted a three-way comparison of instructional delivery modes (online, F2F, hybrid) to investigate their impact on L2 teacher candidate self-efficacy. Although the results demonstrated that all three modes of instruction can be equally effective at increasing candidate confidence, they also highlighted the potential of hybridized instruction to address the limitations of online and F2F instruction, while still including their strengths. The findings also emphasized that simply viewing or participating in live demonstrations of teaching strategies in post-secondary methodology courses is not sufficient. To feel confident in their teaching abilities, teacher candidates need opportunities in their coursework to apply what they have learned in K-12 classrooms. Offering numerous research-based suggestions to improve the design of hybridized methodology courses, the study also serves to inform the development of future hybridized methodology coursework.",Education,Educational Leadership,2014.0
2-s2.0-84927799493,Article,"Background: The prevalence of musculoskeletal injuries among nursing staff has been high due to patient handling and movement. Internationally, healthcare organizations are integrating technological equipment into patient handling and movement to improve safety. Although evidence shows that safe patient handling programs reduce work-related musculoskeletal injuries in nursing staff, it is not clear how safe these new programs are for patients. Objectives: The objective of this study was to explore adverse patient events associated with safe patient handling programs and preventive approaches in US Veterans Affairs medical centers. Methods: The study surveyed a convenience sample of safe patient handling program managers from 51 US Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers to collect data on skin-related and fall-related adverse patient events. Results: Both skin- and fall-related adverse patient events associated with safe patient handling occurred at VA Medical centers. Skin-related events included abrasions, contusions, pressure ulcers and lacerations. Fall-related events included sprains and strains, fractures, concussions and bleeding. Program managers described contextual factors in these adverse events and ways of preventing the events. Conclusions: The use of safe patient handling equipment can pose risks for patients. This study found that organizational factors, human factors and technology factors were associated with patient adverse events. The findings have implications for how nursing professionals can implement safe patient handling programs in ways that are safe for both staff and patients.",CHHS,Nursing,2014.0

2-s2.0-84927921637,Conference Paper,"Computer-aided diagnosis of masses in mammograms is important to the prevention of breast cancer. Many approaches tackle this problem through content-based image retrieval (CBIR) techniques. However, most of them fall short of scalability in the retrieval stage, and their diagnostic accuracy is therefore restricted. To overcome this drawback, we propose a scalable method for retrieval and diagnosis of mam-mographic masses. Specifically, for a query mammographic region of interest (ROI), SIFT descriptors are extracted and searched in a vocabulary tree, which stores all the quantized descriptors of previously diagnosed mammographic ROIs. In addition, to fully exert the discriminative power of SIFT descriptors, contextual information in the vocabulary tree is employed to refine the weights of tree nodes. The retrieved ROIs are then used to determine whether the query ROI contains a mass. This method has excellent scalability due to the low spatial-temporal cost of vocabulary tree. Retrieval precision and diagnostic accuracy are evaluated on 5005 ROIs extracted from the digital database for screening mammography (DDSM), which demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2014.0

In this paper, we focus on a scalable image retrieval method with high-dimensional features for the analysis of histopathology images. Specifically, we present a kernelized and supervised hashing method. With a small amount of supervised information, our method can compress a 10, 000-dimensional image feature vector into only tens of binary bits with informative signatures preserved, and these binary codes are then indexed into a hash table that enables real-time retrieval. We validate the hashing-based image retrieval framework on several thousands of images of breast microscopic tissues for both image classification (i.e., benign vs. actionable categorization) and retrieval.

2-s2.0-84927923980,Conference Paper,"In image-guided neurosurgery, preoperatively acquired diagnostic images (e.g., brain MRI) should be accurately registered to the physical space that is specific to the patient's intraoperative neuroanatomy. A popular framework of registration requires manual defining corresponding positions of fiducial markers on the patient head and the preoperative brain MRI. The procedure is time-consuming and subjective to intra-and inter-observer variations. Therefore, markerless-based registration becomes increasingly popular. In this paper, we propose an automated markerless registration framework. Instead of using physical markers, we automatically detect feature points in face depth maps. The preoperative facial depth map is extracted from MRI, while the intraoperative map is reconstructed with structured light projection, using phase shifting interferometry. Then, we automatically detect and match the feature points on these two depth maps, using a robust method based on the extended SIFT algorithm. The transform matrix between the two coordinate systems can be computed accordingly. Our experiments on real data result in reasonable registration efficiency, while synthetic testing reveals promising accuracy.

It is effective to represent complex shape variations, with its ability to capture gross errors and preserve local details. However, SSC has low efficiency when dealing with large-scale training data, which adversely affects its more widespread clinical use. In this paper, we investigate efficient and scalable convex optimization methods and propose a nearly real-time SSC for large dataset. The new method solves the convex optimization problem in SSC by continuously transforming it into a series of simplified problems whose solution is fast to compute, without sacrificing the accuracy. It significantly speeds up the shape modeling process. When the repository's capacity is 10000, with 2000 vertices on each shape, the optimization can be solved by the new method in less than 10 seconds, nearly 2000 times faster than traditional method in SSC.

The automatic delineation is however challenging due to the heterogeneous intensity distribution of the myocardium. In this paper, we propose a fully automatic method, which combines the complementary information from the two sequences using the newly proposed Multi-Component Bivariate Gaussian (MCBG) mixture model. The expectation maximization (EM) framework is adopted to estimate the segmentation and model parameters, where a probabilistic atlas is also used. This method performs the segmentation on the two MRI sequences simultaneously, and hence improves the robustness and accuracy. The results on six clinical cases showed that the proposed method significantly improved the performance compared to the atlas-based methods: myocardium Dice scores 0.643±0.084 versus 0.576±0.103 (P=0.002) on DE MRI, and 0.623±0.129 versus 0.484±0.106 (P=0.002) on T2 MRI.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2014.0

We model and analyze the interaction between a fingerprinter and a target as a signaling game. We derive the Nash equilibrium strategy profiles based on the information gain analysis. Based on our game results, we design DeceiveGame, a mechanism to prevent or to significantly slow down fingerprinting attacks.

However, active life expectancy studies have provided limited information about strokes in the United States, those occurring throughout older life, or those affecting African Americans. Objective: To measure associations between strokes throughout older life and active life expectancy for African American and White women and men. Methods: Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, 1999-2009 (n = 1862, 13,603 person-years), we estimated monthly probabilities of death and disability in activities of daily living with multinomial logistic Markov models adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, stroke in the past two years, earlier stroke, and education. A random effect accounted for the panel data repeated measures. Microsimulation created large populations with stroke incidence throughout older life, identifying life expectancy and the proportions of remaining life with and without disability. We matched individuals with strokes with randomly selected persons without strokes by age at first stroke, sex, ethnicity, and previous disability. Results: Average age at first stroke was higher for women, lower for African Americans. African American and White women were disabled for about two-thirds of life after stroke; results for men were 61.8% for African Americans and 37.2% for Whites. Compared to matched participants, those with strokes lived 33% fewer remaining years (95% confidence interval, CI 30.9%-34.7%) with a 31.6% greater proportion of remaining life with disability (CI 14.4%-55.6%).

2-s2.0-84928152140,Article,"Purpose - The aim of this research is to theorize and demonstrate that analyzing consumers’ text product reviews using text mining can enhance the explanatory power of a product sales model, particularly for hedonic products, which tend to generate emotional and subjective product evaluations. Previous research in this area has been more focused on utilitarian products. Design/methodology/approach - Our text clustering-based procedure segments text reviews into multiple clusters in association with consumers’ numeric ratings to address consumer heterogeneity in taste preferences and quality valuations and the J-distribution of numeric product ratings. This approach is novel in terms of combining text clustering with numeric product ratings to address consumers’ subjective product evaluations. Findings - Using the movie industry as our empirical application, we find that our approach of making use of product text reviews can improve the explanatory power and predictive validity of the box-office sales model. Research limitations/implications - Marketing scholars have actively investigated the impact of consumers’ online product reviews on product sales, primarily focusing on consumers’ numeric product ratings. Recently, studies have also examined user-generated content. Similarly, this study looks into users’ textual product reviews to explain product sales. It remains to be seen how generalizable our empirical results are beyond our movie application. Practical implications - Whereas numeric ratings can indicate how much viewers liked products, consumers’ reviews can convey why viewers liked or disliked them. Therefore, our review analysis can help marketers understand what factors make new products succeed or fail. Originality/value - Primarily our approach is suitable to products subjectively evaluated, mostly, hedonic products. In doing so, we consider consumer heterogeneity contained in reviews through our review clusters based on their divergent impacts on sales.",Business,Marketing,2014.0
2-s2.0-84928235244,Article,"Background: The body-bar Pebble Game (PG) algorithm is commonly used to calculate network rigidity properties in proteins and polymeric materials. To account for fluctuating interactions such as hydrogen bonds, an ensemble of constraint topologies are sampled, and average network properties are obtained by averaging PG characterizations. At a simpler level of sophistication, Maxwell constraint counting (MCC) provides a rigorous lower bound for the number of internal degrees of freedom (DOF) within a body-bar network, and it is commonly employed to test if a molecular structure is globally under-constrained or over-constrained. MCC is a mean field approximation (MFA) that ignores spatial fluctuations of distance constraints by replacing the actual molecular structure by an effective medium that has distance constraints globally distributed with perfect uniform density. Results: The Virtual Pebble Game (VPG) algorithm is a MFA that retains spatial inhomogeneity in the density of constraints on all length scales. Network fluctuations due to distance constraints that may be present or absent based on binary random dynamic variables are suppressed by replacing all possible constraint topology realizations with the probabilities that distance constraints are present. The VPG algorithm is isomorphic to the PG algorithm, where integers for counting ""pebbles"" placed on vertices or edges in the PG map to real numbers representing the probability to find a pebble. In the VPG, edges are assigned pebble capacities, and pebble movements become a continuous flow of probability within the network. Comparisons between the VPG and average PG results over a test set of proteins and disordered lattices demonstrate the VPG quantitatively estimates the ensemble average PG results well. Conclusions: The VPG performs about 20% faster than one PG, and it provides a pragmatic alternative to averaging PG rigidity characteristics over an ensemble of constraint topologies. The utility of the VPG falls in between the most accurate but slowest method of ensemble averaging over hundreds to thousands of independent PG runs, and the fastest but least accurate MCC.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2015.0

In [1], we introduced a collision-free perceiver (CFP) that can detect guaranteed collision-free trajectory segments in the unknown configuration-time (CT) space of a robot without assuming known obstacle geometry or motion. However, such a guarantee by the CFP is at the expense of a finite period for perception and processing of each collision-free CT point. In this paper, we address how to incorporate the CFP, taking into account its finite processing time, into real-time motion planning to enable a robot of high degree of freedom to plan and move at the same time in an unknown and unpredictable environment while minimizing unsafe stops when the robot may collide with an obstacle.

The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of nano-scale roughness and chemistry of bioactive silica-calcium phosphate nanocomposite (SCPC50) coated Ti-6Al-4V on modulating early bone cell responses. Cell attachment was higher on SCPC50-coated substrates compared to the uncoated controls; however, cells on the uncoated substrate exhibited greater spreading and superior quality of F-actin filaments than cells on the SCPC50-coated substrates. The poor F-actin filament organization on SCPC50-coated substrates is thought to be due to the enhanced calcium uptake by the ceramic surface. Dissolution analyses showed that an increase in surface roughness was accompanied by increased calcium uptake, and increased phosphorous and silicon release, all of which appear to interfere with F-actin assembly and osteoblast morphology. Moreover, cell attachment onto the SCPC50-coated substrates correlated with the known adsorption of fibronectin, and was independent of surface roughness. High-throughput genome sequencing showed enhanced expression of extracellular matrix and cell differentiation related genes. These results demonstrate a synergistic relationship between bioactive ceramic coating roughness and material chemistry resulting in a phenotype that leads to early osteoblast differentiation.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2015.0

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) accounts for the majority of PKD cases and is the predominant monogenic cause of ESRD. Limited information on patient characteristics and healthcare resource utilization is available in this population. This study assessed hospital-based inpatient utilization of patients with ADPKD in the US to help further understand the disease, which may lead to treatments that delay progression and reduce healthcare resource utilization. Methods: A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using MedAssets Health System Data to investigate inpatient resource utilization for a total of 1876 patients hospitalized with ADPKD or chronic kidney disease (CKD). Patient characteristics and inpatient resource utilization were compared between hospitalized patients with ADPKD and CKD, including demographic and clinical characteristics, overall health, rates of complications and surgical interventions, and average length of hospital and intensive care unit stay. Results: Compared with patients with CKD, patients with ADPKD were more likely to have commercial insurance as their primary payer (36.1 vs 17.8%) and were significantly younger (mean age 57.9 vs 69.5 years) and generally healthier (Charlson Comorbidity Score of 2.0 vs 3.3). Patients with ADPKD also had a substantially shorter average length of hospital stay (6.3 vs 10.3 days). However, patients with ADPKD experienced more kidney-related complications and a higher surgical procedure rate (mainly for transplant and complete nephrectomy).

This study estimates long-term (beyond 90-day) costs and outcomes associated with qPTP. The authors hypothesized that qPTP reduces lifetime costs and improves outcomes in low-risk patients with symptoms suggestive of ACS and PE. Methods: This was a cost-effectiveness analysis of a multicenter, randomized controlled trial of adult emergency patients with dyspnea and chest pain, in which a clinician encountering a low-risk patient with symptoms suggestive of ACS or PE conducted either the intervention (qPTP for ACS and PE with advice) or the sham (no qPTP and no advice). Effect of the intervention over a patient's lifetime was assessed using a Markov microsimulation model. Short-term costs and outcomes were from the trial; long-term outcomes and costs were from the literature. Outcomes included lifetime transition to PE, ACS, and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH); mortality from cancer, ICH, PE, ACS, renal failure, and ischemic stroke; quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs); and total medical costs compared between simulated intervention and sham groups. Results: Markov microsimulation for a 40-year-old patient receiving qPTP found lifetime cost savings of $497 for women and $528 for men, associated with small gains in QALYs (2 and 6 days, respectively) and lower rates of cancer mortality in both sexes, but a reduction in ICH only in males. Sensitivity analysis for patients aged 60 years predicted that qPTP would continue to save costs and also reduce mortality from both ICH and cancer. Use of qPTP significantly reduced the lifetime probability of PE diagnosis, with lower probability of death from PE in both sexes aged 40 to 60 years. However, use of qPTP reduced the rate of ACS diagnosis and death from ACS at age 40, but increased the death rate from ACS at age 60 for both sexes.

2-s2.0-84929161185,Article,"Delay tolerant networks (DTNs) recently have drawn much attention from researchers due to their wide applications in various challenging environments. Previous DTN research mainly concentrates on information propagation and packet delivery. However, with possible participation of a large number of mobile devices, how to maintain efficient and dynamic topology becomes crucial. In this paper, we study the topology design problem in a predictable DTN where the time-evolving topology is known a priori or can be predicted. We model such a time-evolving network as a weighted directed space-time graph which includes both spacial and temporal information. Links inside the space-time graph are unreliable due to either the dynamic nature of wireless communications or the rough prediction of underlying human/device mobility. The purpose of our reliable topology design problem is to build a sparse structure from the original space-time graph such that (1) for any pair of devices, there is a space-time path connecting them with a reliability higher than the required threshold; (2) the total cost of the structure is minimized. Such an optimization problem is NP-hard, thus we propose several heuristics which can significantly reduce the total cost of the topology while maintain the 'reliable' connectivity over time.

In the efficient ideal secret sharing schemes that we will construct, only XOR-operations on binary strings are required (which is the best we could achieve). These schemes will have many applications both in practice and in theory. For example, they could be used to design very efficient verifiable secret sharing schemes which will have broad applications in secure multi-party computation and could be used to design efficient privacy preserving data storage in cloud systems.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2014.0
2-s2.0-84929326090,Article,"Large-scale sensor networks are deployed in numerous application domains, and the data they collect are used in decision-making for critical infrastructures. Data are streamed from multiple sources through intermediate processing nodes that aggregate information. A malicious adversary may introduce additional nodes in the network or compromise existing ones. Therefore, assuring high data trustworthiness is crucial for correct decision-making. Data provenance represents a key factor in evaluating the trustworthiness of sensor data. Provenance management for sensor networks introduces several challenging requirements, such as low energy and bandwidth consumption, efficient storage and secure transmission. In this paper, we propose a novel lightweight scheme to securely transmit provenance for sensor data. The proposed technique relies on in-packet Bloom filters to encode provenance. We introduce efficient mechanisms for provenance verification and reconstruction at the base station. In addition, we extend the secure provenance scheme with functionality to detect packet drop attacks staged by malicious data forwarding nodes. We evaluate the proposed technique both analytically and empirically, and the results prove the effectiveness and efficiency of the lightweight secure provenance scheme in detecting packet forgery and loss attacks.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2015.0
2-s2.0-84929327799,Article,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine how patient assessment of primary care physician (PCP) communication is related to patient satisfaction with the PCP, patient perception of PCP professional competence, patient assessment of the relationship with the doctor and patient demographic characteristics using a segmentation approach. Design/methodology/approach – The authors surveyed 514 adult patients waiting for appointments with their PCPs in two US primary care clinics. A latent class analysis was used to identify mutually exclusive unobserved homogeneous classes of patients. Findings – The authors identified three distinct classes/groups with regard to patient assessment of physician communication and the physician-patient relationship. The largest group (53 percent of the sample) assessed their PCP communication and other doctor-patient relationship aspects as excellent. However, 37 percent provided mostly negative assessments, expressed high general dissatisfaction with the physician and disagreed with the statement that their PCP was well qualified to manage their health problems. These patients were on average more educated and affluent and the group included more males. About 10 percent of patients expressed generally lower satisfaction with the PCP, though their dissatisfaction was not as extreme as in the highly dissatisfied group. Research limitations/implications – Further studies are needed to help physicians develop skills to communicate with different patients. Originality/value – Patient segmentation can be an important tool for healthcare quality improvement particularly for emerging approaches to primary care such as patient-centered care.",CHHS,Public Health,2015.0
2-s2.0-84929330249,Article,"Research on procedural justice and legitimacy has expanded greatly across the social sciences in recent years. The process-based model of regulation, which links people's assessments of procedural justice and legitimacy to their compliance with the law and legal authorities, has become particularly influential in criminology and sociolegal studies. A review of the previous research on perceived legitimacy highlights two important features. First, legitimacy has been conceptualized and measured in many different ways. Second, most of the research on legitimacy has focused on only a handful of developed nations. Using survey data from Trinidad and Tobago, this article examines the conceptualization and measurement of the perceived legitimacy of the law and legal authorities. The findings indicate that some of the prominent conceptual and measurement models used in previous research are not empirically valid in the Trinidadian context. The implications of the results for conceptualization, theory, and future research are discussed.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Criminal Justice and Criminology,2014.0
2-s2.0-84929332324,Article,"Background: Alcohol abuse among freshmen university students is a major public health issue with associated costs to individuals and the society of substantial morbidity, high-risk negative behaviors (e.g., blackouts, rape, suicide, and violence), and mortality. This longitudinal study compared the effectiveness of a brief motivational intervention (MI) in decreasing alcohol consumption and related consequences among mandated students and voluntary students. Readiness to change drinking behaviors was compared between the groups. Methods: Eligible participants (710 voluntary and 190 mandated, N = 900) received MI at baseline and again at 2weeks with boosters at 3, 6, and 12months. Repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to compare the two groups. Results: Alcohol use and related consequences in both groups decreased significantly between baseline and 12months. At baseline, a significantly larger percent of students from the mandated group than the voluntary group were in the action stage of change (52.1% vs. 27.5%), and a significantly smaller percentage of mandated students were in the precontemplation stage (. p<.0001). Discussion: MI effects were sustained over 12months. Alcohol consumption and related consequences decreased significantly among the freshmen who were mandated to attend the program as well as among students who volunteered to participate in the study. The findings support the importance of advanced practice nurses conducting MI as an intervention with college students.",CHHS,Nursing,2015.0
2-s2.0-84929349395,Article,"LDPC codes, LT codes, and digital fountain techniques have received significant attention from both academics and industry in the past few years. By employing the underlying ideas of efficient Belief Propagation (BP) decoding process in LDPC and LT codes, this paper designs the BP-XOR codes and use them to design three classes of secret sharing schemes called BP-XOR secret sharing schemes, pseudo-BP-XOR secret sharing schemes, and LDPC secret sharing schemes. By establishing the equivalence between the edge-colored graph model and degree-two BP-XOR secret sharing schemes, we are able to design novel perfect and ideal 2-out-of-n BP-XOR secret sharing schemes. By employing techniques from array code design, we are also able to design other (n; k) threshold LDPC secret sharing schemes. In the efficient (pseudo) BP-XOR/LDPC secret sharing schemes that we will construct, only linear number of XOR (exclusive-or) operations on binary strings are required for both secret distribution phase and secret reconstruction phase. For a comparison, we should note that Shamir secret sharing schemes require O(n log n) field operations for the secret distribution phase and O(n2) field operations for the secret reconstruction phase. Furthermore, our schemes achieve the optimal update complexity for secret sharing schemes. By update complexity for a secret sharing scheme, we mean the average number of bits in the participant's shares that needs to be revised when certain bit of the master secret is changed. The extremely efficient secret sharing schemes discussed in this paper could be used for massive data storage in cloud environments achieving privacy and reliability without employing encryption techniques.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2015.0

Mobile technology allows providers to reach people who may be isolated and desire increased social support. Watching video-recorded patient stories on DVD has improved blood pressure for new patients with hypertension1. Multiple websites offer digital storytelling to persons with diabetes2,3. Telephone support groups and multimedia interventions are well-regarded4,5. A national ADEAR/NLM trial on a Psychosocial Telephone Intervention for Dementia Caregivers offers caregivers 16 phone calls over 6 months from a researcher who offers support6. Combining new technologies with culturally-sensitive social support is powerful, since smart phone ownership is higher among African-Americans and Latinos than among Caucasians7. Method: Story-Call is our newly-developed mobile phone application that records, archives, and presents 30/60-second videos by caregivers (CG) who share success stories about how they handle common dementia home-care situations such as, 'She wants to go home!' Phase 1, a proof-of-concept pilot, tested how well 5 consented female working CGs recruited from adult day care centers could use the App prototype with minimal instructions to successfully record stories; pre- and post-intervention testing with the Zarit Burden Scale and Kaye's Gain Through Group Involvement scale examined perceived burden and willingness to seek social support. Results & Discussion: The minimal directions enabled 4 working Anglo female caregivers to easily access the mobile App, to record CG success stories, and to view others' stories. One CG accessed it easily but, nervous about being photographed, withdrew. Pre-/post-tests identified high satisfaction with the App and ease of use, and suggest that measuring outcomes for caregiver burden across a larger group will be feasible. Barriers to recruiting and diversity were identified; Phase 2 will work to recruit diverse men and women CG from a larger geographic region and seek both isolated rural and minority CG, particularly working CG.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2014.0
2-s2.0-84929417456,"General Publications (Press, Editorials, Letters)","Coalbed methane (CBM) makes up a significant portion of the world's natural gas resources. The discovery that approximately 20% of natural gas is microbial in origin has led to interest in microbially enhanced CBM (MECoM), which involves stimulating microorganisms to produce additional CBM from existing production wells. This paper reviews current laboratory and field research on understanding processes and reservoir conditions which are essential for microbial CBM generation, the progress of efforts to stimulate microbial methane generation in coal beds, and key remaining knowledge gaps. Research has been primarily focused on identifying microbial communities present in areas of CBM generation and attempting to determine their function, in-situ reservoir conditions that are most favorable for microbial CBM generation, and geochemical indicators of metabolic pathways of methanogenesis (i.e., acetoclastic or hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis). Meanwhile, researchers at universities, government agencies, and companies have focused on four primary MECoM strategies: 1) microbial stimulation (i.e., addition of nutrients to stimulate native microbes); 2) microbial augmentation (i.e., addition of microbes not native to or abundant in the reservoir of interest); 3) physically increasing microbial access to coal and distribution of amendments; and 4) chemically increasing the bioavailability of coal organics. Most companies interested in MECoM have pursued microbial stimulation: Luca Technologies, Inc., successfully completed a pilot scale field test of their stimulation strategy, while two others, Ciris Energy and Next Fuel, Inc., have undertaken smaller scale field tests. Several key knowledge gaps remain that need to be addressed before MECoM strategies can be implemented commercially. Little is known about the bacterial community responsible for coal biodegradation and how these microorganisms may be stimulated to enhance microbial methanogenesis. In addition, research is needed to understand what fraction of coal is available for biodegradation, and methods need to be developed to determine the extent of in-situ coal biodegradation by MECoM processes for monitoring changes to coal quality. Questions also remain about how well field-scale pilot tests will scale to commercial production, how often amendments will need to be added to maintain new methane generation, and how well MECoM strategies transfer between coal basins with different formation water geochemistries and coal ranks. Addressing these knowledge gaps will be key in determining the feasibility and commercial viability of MECoM technology.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2015.0
2-s2.0-84929455079,Article,"Education research has shown that there is often a disconnect between what instructors teach and what students actually comprehend. Much of this disconnect stems from students' previous conceptions of the subject that often remain steadfast despite instruction. The field of meteorology is particularly susceptible to misconceptions as a result of the years of personal experience students have with weather before instruction. Consequently, it is often challenging for students to accurately integrate course material with their observations and personal explanations. A longitudinal assessment exam of the meteorology program at the U.S. Air Force Academy revealed that misconceptions of fundamental, introductory content can propagate through years of instruction, potentially impeding deeper understanding of advanced topics and hindering attainment of professional certifications. Thus, it is clear that such misconceptions must be identified and corrected early. This manuscript describes the development of the Fundamentals in Meteorology Inventory (FMI), a multiple-choice assessment exam designed to identify the common misconceptions of fundamental topics covered in introductory meteorology courses. In developing the FMI, care was taken to avoid complex vocabulary and to include plausible distractors identified by meteorology faculty members. Question topics include clouds and precipitation, wind, fronts and air masses, temperature, stability, severe weather, and climate. Applications of the exam for the meteorology community are discussed, including identifying common meteorology misconceptions, assessing student understanding, measuring teaching effectiveness, and diagnosing areas for improvement in introductory meteorology courses. Future work to be completed to ensure the efficacy of the FMI will also be acknowledged.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2015.0
2-s2.0-84929500827,Article,"Invention has been commonly conceptualized as a search over a space of combinatorial possibilities. Despite the existence of a rich literature, spanning a variety of disciplines, elaborating on the recombinant nature of invention, we lack a formal and quantitative characterization of the combinatorial process underpinning inventive activity. Here, we use US patent records dating from 1790 to 2010 to formally characterize invention as a combinatorial process. To do this, we treat patented inventions as carriers of technologies and avail ourselves of the elaborate system of technology codes used by the United States Patent and Trademark Office to classify the technologies responsible for an invention's novelty. We find that the combinatorial inventive process exhibits an invariant rate of 'exploitation' (refinements of existing combinations of technologies) and 'exploration' (the development of new technological combinations). This combinatorial dynamic contrasts sharply with the creation of new technological capabilities - the building blocks to be combined - that has significantly slowed down.We also find that, notwithstanding the very reduced rate at which new technologies are introduced, the generation of novel technological combinations engenders a practically infinite space of technological configurations.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2015.0

Mentors themselves were also supported by a Mentor Coordinator. As part of a quasi-experimental study of implementation fidelity effects, the intensity of mentoring intervention was measured by the Intensity of Intervention Scale and the intervention group was divided into high and moderate intensity levels. Evidence is presented for the effects of high intensity levels of the ILI Mentoring programme, relative to moderate intensity and control conditions, on the children in the Protégé teachers’ classrooms. These results lead to practice and policy implications regarding the implementation of mentoring programmes such as the ILI which are designed for early childhood educators and built upon adult self-directed learning experiences and collaborative support.",Education,Educational Leadership,2015.0

Because gifted education practices in the USA may provide models for the development of these practices in other countries, it seems important to evaluate the presence and content of programming in creativity and leadership in the USA to develop an understanding of what strengths and barriers these aspects of giftedness may face in other settings. In this pilot study, I examined gifted policies to identify US states that would be highly supportive of programming in leadership or creative giftedness. I then searched systematically for evidence of such programming on the gifted education pages of district Web sites within two of these states. Findings reveal that a widely varied level of detail is provided online at the district level; while there was at least one strong description evident in both the creativity and leadership areas, these were the exception rather than the rule.

New clinical tools for early detection of ovarian malignancies will significantly help reduce mortality and improve current long-term survival rates. The objective of this work was to identify ovarian tumor-specific single-stranded DNA aptamers that bind to malignant ovarian tumor cells and internalize with high affinity and specificity. Aptamers can identify unique tumor biomarkers, can aid in early detection and diagnosis of neoplastic disorders, and can be functionalized by conjugation to small molecules. To identify aptamers from random single-stranded DNA pools (60 bases long), we used whole Cell-SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) to enrich and isolate tumor-specific aptamers that bind to tumor-specific receptors in their native state on the cell surface. Next-Generation sequencing identified seven novel aptamers and detailed analyses of three are described. Aptamers bound to, and were internalized by, target Caov-3 cell populations, but not nontarget nonmalignant ovarian epithelial HOSE 6-3 cells or multiple other epithelial tumor cell lines.

However, their smoking habits may limit their ability to intervene with their patients who smoke. Aims: To determine prevalence rates of current smoking and examine sociodemographic and work-related factors associated with current smoking among HCPs. Methods: A statewide survey was conducted in a representative sample of 4 groups of HCPs, physicians, nurses, respiratory therapists, and occupational therapists, with active licenses in Texas in 2003. Weighted prevalence estimates of current smoking rates were computed. Survey logistic regression analysis was used to investigate associations between individual characteristics and current smoking. Results: There were 3600 HCPs included in the analysis. The overall prevalence of current smoking was 9% with the highest prevalence (16%) recorded among respiratory therapists and the lowest prevalence (3%) recorded among physicians. In the multivariable logistic regression analysis non-Hispanic white HCPs were almost 4 times as likely to be current smokers (adjusted odds ratio= 3.95, 95% confidence interval = 1.24-12.59) and those working for 50 hours or more per week were twice as likely to be current smokers (adjusted odds ratio = 2.07, 95% CI = 1.20-3.57).

Supporting pervasive communications among mobile devices in such a large-scale mobile social network becomes a key challenge for this new mobile sensing system. One possible solution is allowing packet delivery among mobile devices via opportunistic communications during intermittent contacts. However, the lack of rich contact opportunities still causes poor delivery ratio and long delay, especially for large-scale networks. Deployment of additional stationary throwboxes can create a greater number of contact opportunities, thus improve the performance of routing. However, the locations of deployed throwboxes are critical to such improvement. In this paper, we investigate where to deploy throwboxes in a large-scale throwbox-assisted mobile social DTN. By leveraging the social properties discovered from real-life tracing data, we propose a set of social-based throwbox placement algorithms which smartly pick the location of each throwbox.

Decisional regret was associated with androgen-deprivation therapy (odds ratio [OR], 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-4.0), recent urinary bother (OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.6-7.3), satisfaction with understanding potential treatment side effects (very unsatisfied: OR, 13.3; 95% CI, 5.5-32.2; somewhat unsatisfied: OR, 5.0; 95% CI, 2.3-11.2; neutral: OR, 3.8; 95% CI, 1.9-7.6), and CaP treatment effect on the spousal relationship (very affected: OR, 3.9; 95% CI, 2.0-7.6; somewhat affected: OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.4-7.3; neutral: OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.9-7.6). Younger African Americans were more likely to experience regret than older African Americans (OR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.1-8.1), and older African Americans were less likely to experience regret than older Caucasian Americans (OR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.1-0.7). CONCLUSIONS Treatment decisional regret remains an important issue in CaP survivors beyond initial treatment. Potential interventions should involve younger African Americans and patient spouses. Increased regret may reflect the unexpected influence of treatment side effects on the patient's everyday life; helping the patient relate potential side effects to his individual situation could improve patient satisfaction.

2-s2.0-84930384896,Article,"The contention of this paper is that many social science research problems are too “wicked” to be suitably studied using conventional statistical and regression-based methods of data analysis. This paper argues that an integrated geospatial approach based on methods of machine learning is well suited to this purpose. Recognizing the intrinsic wickedness of traffic safety issues, such approach is used to unravel the complexity of traffic crash severity on highway corridors as an example of such problems. The support vector machine (SVM) and coactive neuro-fuzzy inference system (CANFIS) algorithms are tested as inferential engines to predict crash severity and uncover spatial and non-spatial factors that systematically relate to crash severity, while a sensitivity analysis is conducted to determine the relative influence of crash severity factors. Different specifications of the two methods are implemented, trained, and evaluated against crash events recorded over a 4-year period on a regional highway corridor in Northern Iran. Overall, the SVM model outperforms CANFIS by a notable margin. The combined use of spatial analysis and artificial intelligence is effective at identifying leading factors of crash severity, while explicitly accounting for spatial dependence and spatial heterogeneity effects. Thanks to the demonstrated effectiveness of a sensitivity analysis, this approach produces comprehensive results that are consistent with existing traffic safety theories and supports the prioritization of effective safety measures that are geographically targeted and behaviorally sound on regional highway corridors.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2015.0

2-s2.0-84930661912,Article,"Background: Oxidative stress caused by ground level ozone is a contributor to yield loss in a number of important crop plants. Soybean (Glycine max) is considered to be ozone sensitive, and current research into its response to oxidative stress is limited. To better understand the genetic response in soybean to oxidative stress, an RNA-seq analysis of two soybean cultivars was performed comparing an ozone intolerant cultivar (Mandarin-Ottawa) and an ozone resistant cultivar (Fiskeby III) following exposure to ozone. Results: Analysis of the transcriptome data revealed cultivar-specific expression level differences of genes previously implicated in oxidative stress responses, indicating unique cultivar-specific responses. Both Fiskeby III and Mandarin (Ottawa) exhibit an increased expression of oxidative response genes as well as glutathiones, phenylpropanoids, and phenylalanine ammonia-lyases. Mandarin (Ottawa) exhibited more general stress response genes whereas Fiskeby III had heightened expression of metabolic process genes. An examination of the timing of gene responses over the course of ozone exposure identified significantly more differentially expressed genes across all time points in Mandarin (Ottawa) than in Fiskeby III. The timing of expression was also considered to identify genes that may be indicative of a delayed response to ozone stress in Fiskeby III, We found that Mandarin (Ottawa) exhibits an higher level of expression in early time points for oxidative and general stress response genes while Fiskeby III seems to maintain expression of defense and stress response genes. Of particular interest was the expression of wax and cutin biosynthetic genes that we found to be expressed in Mandarin (Ottawa) in all sampled time points, whereas the expression of this pathway is only in the first time point for Fiskeby III. Conclusions: We were able to identify differentially expressed genes that correspond to each of the known or expected categories of genes previously implicated in other species for ozone stress. Our study shows evidence that at least part of the observed ozone tolerance of Fiskeby III may be due to its thicker, denser leaves providing passive resistance thereby limiting the degree of ozone exposure. The observed diminished genetic response is then likely a consequence of this reduced exposure.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2015.0

The book discusses the early formations of the Transatlantic Slave Trade, the enslavement of native populations, and the subsequent development of the Underground Railroad and Maroon societies in the Caribbean and Americas as systems of liberation. It investigates the development and maintenance of racial, gendered and class stratification, and provides a personal path to freedom as a context for a broader discussion on using education as a mechanism for dismantling the effects of colonization, miseducation, and social-psychological domination in schools and society. As a contemporary issue, it presents an in depth analysis of the Tucson Unified School District in Arizona, and the controversy surrounding its ethnic studies program as an example of one of the contested sites of curriculum development and student liberation. Additionally, it discusses high performing charter schools as an alternative model of education, which may help to provide a systematic way of unshackling institutional barriers and oppression. Ultimately, this book acknowledges that today the road to freedom is still one we must all travel as: miseducation, school failure, school dropout, unemployment/underemployment, poverty, neighborhood violence, incarceration, and a growing prison industrial complex are all reminders of the work that still must be accomplished. Like those who historically sacrificed their lives to gain freedom and an education, today, with the lingering effects of institutionalized systems of domination, education must continue to be an instrument of social mobility and liberation, if indeed, we are to make schools and society more humane and inclusive towards those who are still waiting to be unshackled.

Abstract: Quantitative trait loci analysis of glucosinolate (GSL) variability was conducted with a B. oleracea (broccoli) mapping population, saturated with single nucleotide polymorphism markers from a high-density array designed for rapeseed (Brassica napus). In 4 years of analysis, 14 QTLs were associated with the accumulation of aliphatic, indolic, or aromatic GSLs in floret tissue. The accumulation of 3-carbon aliphatic GSLs (2-propenyl and 3-methylsulfinylpropyl) was primarily associated with a single QTL on C05, but common regulation of 4-carbon aliphatic GSLs was not observed. A single locus on C09, associated with up to 40 % of the phenotypic variability of 2-hydroxy-3-butenyl GSL over multiple years, was not associated with the variability of precursor compounds. Similarly, QTLs on C02, C04, and C09 were associated with 4-methylsulfinylbutyl GSL concentration over multiple years but were not significantly associated with downstream compounds. Genome-specific SNP markers were used to identify candidate genes that co-localized to marker intervals and previously sequenced Brassica oleracea BAC clones containing known GSL genes (GSL-ALK, GSL-PRO, and GSL-ELONG) were aligned to the genomic sequence, providing support that at least three of our 14 QTLs likely correspond to previously identified GSL loci. The results demonstrate that previously identified loci do not fully explain GSL variation in broccoli. The identification of additional genetic factors influencing the accumulation of GSL in broccoli florets provides novel insight into the regulation of GSL levels in Brassicaceae and will accelerate development of vegetables with modified or enhanced GSL profiles.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2015.0

2-s2.0-84930937466,Article,"Abstract NIST SP800-22 (2010) proposed the state of the art statistical testing techniques for testing the quality of (pseudo) random generators. However, it is easy to construct natural functions that are considered as GOOD pseudorandom generators by the NIST SP800-22 test suite though the output of these functions is easily distinguishable from the uniform distribution. This paper proposes solutions to address this challenge by using statistical distance based testing techniques. We carried out both NIST tests and LIL based tests on commonly deployed pseudorandom generators such as the standard C linear congruential generator, Mersenne Twister pseudorandom generator, and Debian Linux (CVE-2008-0166) pseudorandom generator with OpenSSL 0.9.8c-1. Based on experimental results, we illustrate the advantages of our LIL based testing over NIST testing. It is known that Debian Linux (CVE-2008-0166) pseudorandom generator based on OpenSSL 0.9.8c-1 is flawed and the output sequences are predictable. Our LIL tests on these sequences discovered the flaws in Debian Linux implementation. However, NIST SP800-22 test suite is not able to detect this flaw using the NIST recommended parameters. It is concluded that NIST SP800-22 test suite is not sufficient and distance based LIL test techniques be included in statistical testing practice.

They are considered as one of the prime drug targets since mutations and aberrant TF-DNA interactions are implicated in many diseases. Identification of TF-binding sites on a genomic scale represents a critical step in delineating transcription regulatory networks and remains a major goal in genomic annotations. Recent development of experimental high-throughput technologies has provided valuable information about TF-binding sites at genome scale under various physiological and developmental conditions. Computational approaches can provide a cost-effective alternative and complement the experimental methods by using the vast quantities of available sequence or structural information. In this review we focus on structure-based prediction of transcription factor binding sites.

Objective: This longitudinal study examined whether students' mandated/voluntary status in a program to reduce college drinking was associated with overall health, ethnicity, gender, and personality traits. Both mandated and voluntary groups participated in the Motivational Intervention (MI) program to prevent high risk drinking. Methods: Freshmen (710 voluntary, 190 mandated, n = 900) between the ages of 18 and 21, received the MI at baseline and again at 2. weeks, with boosters at 3, 6 and 12. months. Participants completed three measures: the Daily Drinking Questionnaire (DDQ); the Substance Use Risk Profile Scale (SURPS), and the Health Promoting Lifestyle Profile II (HPLPII). Mandated and voluntary participants were compared at baseline and following the intervention using two sample t-tests for continuous variables (overall health, personality traits, drinking measures), and chi-square for categorical variables (gender, ethnicity). Linear mixed models were used to identify associations between HPLP II scores and mandated/voluntary status, time, ethnicity gender and SURPS scale scores. Results: In both groups, alcohol consumption dropped significantly by 12. months. Overall health-promoting behaviors, physical activity, stress management, and interpersonal relations improved in both groups between baseline and 12. months. Associations were found between alcohol consumption, personality traits, gender, and lifestyle health-promoting behaviors.

The purpose of this study was to determine both the reliability and predictors of resistive load detection in children with persistent asthma who completed multiple testing sessions. Methods: Both University of North Carolina (UNC) Charlotte and Ohio University institutional review boards approved the research protocol. The detection of inspiratory resistive loads was evaluated in 75 children with asthma between 8 and 15 years of age. Each child participated in four experimental sessions that occurred approximately once every 2 weeks. Multivariate analyses were used to delineate predictors of task performance. Results: Reliability of resistive load detection was determined for each child, and predictors of load detection outcomes were investigated in two groups of children: those who performed reliably in all four sessions (n=31) and those who performed reliably in three or fewer sessions (n=44). Three factors (development, symptoms, and compliance) accounted for 66.3% of the variance among variables that predicted 38.7% of the variance in load detection outcomes (Multiple R=0.62, p=0.004) and correctly classified performance as reliable or less reliable in 80.6% of the children, χ2(12)=28.88, p=0.004.

These mega-structures, however, directly and indirectly interfere with natural ecosystem dynamics, and can cause noticeable tree loss. To improve our understanding of how hydroelectric dams affect the surrounding spatiotemporal patterns of forest disturbances, this case study integrated remote sensing spectral mixture analysis, GIS proximity analysis and statistical hypothesis testing to extract and evaluate spatially-explicit patterns of deforestation (clearing of entire forest patch) and forest degradation (reduced tree density) in the 80,000km2 neighborhoods of the Brazil's Tucuruí Dam, the first large-scale hydroelectric project in the Amazon region, over a period of 25 years from 1988 to 2013. Results show that the average rates of deforestation were consistent during the first three time periods 1988-1995 (620km2 per year), 1995-2001 (591km2 per year), and 2001-2008 (660km2 per year). However, such rate dramatically fell to half of historical levels after 2008, possibly reflecting the 2008 global economic crisis and enforcement of the Brazilian Law of Environmental Crimes. The rate of forest degradation was relatively stable from 1988 to 2013 and, on average, was 17.8% of the rate of deforestation. Deforestation and forest degradation were found to follow similar spatial patterns across the dam neighborhoods, upstream reaches or downstream reaches at the distances of 5km-80km, suggesting that small and large-scale forest disturbances may have been influencing each other in the vicinity of the dam. We further found that the neighborhoods of the Tucuruí Dam and the upstream region experienced similar degrees of canopy loss. Such loss was mainly attributed to the fast expansion of the Tucuruí town, and the intensive logging activities alongside major roads in the upstream reservoir region. In contrast, a significantly lower level of forest disturbance was discovered in the downstream region.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2015.0

Tuberculosis requires a long and intensive course of treatment. Thus, various approaches, including patient empowerment, education and counselling sessions, and involvement of family members and community workers, have been suggested for improving treatment adherence and outcome. The current randomized controlled trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness over usual care of an innovative multicomponent people-centered tuberculosis-care strategy in Armenia. Methods/design: Innovative Approach to Tuberculosis care in Armenia is an open-label, stratified cluster randomized controlled trial with two parallel arms. Tuberculosis outpatient centers are the clusters assigned to intervention and control arms. Drug-sensitive tuberculosis patients in the continuation phase of treatment in the intervention arm and their family members participate in a short educational and counselling session to raise their knowledge, decrease tuberculosis-related stigma, and enhance treatment adherence. Patients receive the required medications for one week during the weekly visits to the tuberculosis outpatient centers. Additionally, patients receive daily Short Message Service (SMS) reminders to take their medications and daily phone calls to assure adherence and monitoring of treatment potential side effects. Control-arm patients follow the World Health Organization - recommended directly observed treatment strategy, including daily visits to tuberculosis outpatient centers for drug-intake. The primary outcome is physician-reported treatment outcome. Patients' knowledge, depression, quality of life, within-family tuberculosis-related stigma, family social support, and self-reported adherence to tuberculosis treatment are secondary outcomes. Discussion: Improved adherence and tuberculosis treatment outcomes can strengthen tuberculosis control and thereby forestall tuberculosis and multidrug resistant tuberculosis epidemics. Positive findings on effectiveness of this innovative tuberculosis treatment people-centered approach will support its adoption in countries with similar healthcare and economic profiles.

The manufacturer may or may not have the inventory carryover option. We formulate the resulting problems as two-period Stackelberg games and obtain their feedback equilibrium solutions explicitly. We then examine the impact of mean learning rate and learning rate variability on the pricing strategies of the channel members, on the manufacturer's production decisions, and on the retailer's procurement decisions. We show that as the mean learning rate or the learning rate variability increases, the traditional double marginalization problem becomes more severe, leading to greater efficiency loss in the channel. We obtain revenue sharing contracts that can coordinate the dynamic supply chain. In particular, when the manufacturer may hold inventory, we identify two major drivers for inventory carryover: market growth and learning rate variability. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of our results by examining a model in which cost learning takes place continuously.",Business,BISOM,2015.0

Owning families of public firms, still having substantial influence on the compensation process, need to balance the family's genuine interest against PR pay and non-family stakeholders' contrasting preferences in setting the right mix. At first, family and non-family firms show no difference regarding the adoption of PR pay. However, among PR pay adopters, we find family firms to devote greater shares to this pay component, thus sacrificing part of their socioemotional wealth in order to meet stakeholders' demand. A differentiation between different types of family firms reveals that especially true family firms, i.e. firms managed or owned by at least two family members, account for this particular behavior.",Business,Management,2015.0

Tuberculosis requires a long and intensive course of treatment. Thus, various approaches, including patient empowerment, education and counselling sessions, and involvement of family members and community workers, have been suggested for improving treatment adherence and outcome. The current randomized controlled trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness over usual care of an innovative multicomponent people-centered tuberculosis-care strategy in Armenia. Methods/design: Innovative Approach to Tuberculosis care in Armenia is an open-label, stratified cluster randomized controlled trial with two parallel arms. Tuberculosis outpatient centers are the clusters assigned to intervention and control arms. Drug-sensitive tuberculosis patients in the continuation phase of treatment in the intervention arm and their family members participate in a short educational and counselling session to raise their knowledge, decrease tuberculosis-related stigma, and enhance treatment adherence. Patients receive the required medications for one week during the weekly visits to the tuberculosis outpatient centers. Additionally, patients receive daily Short Message Service (SMS) reminders to take their medications and daily phone calls to assure adherence and monitoring of treatment potential side effects. Control-arm patients follow the World Health Organization - recommended directly observed treatment strategy, including daily visits to tuberculosis outpatient centers for drug-intake. The primary outcome is physician-reported treatment outcome. Patients' knowledge, depression, quality of life, within-family tuberculosis-related stigma, family social support, and self-reported adherence to tuberculosis treatment are secondary outcomes. Discussion: Improved adherence and tuberculosis treatment outcomes can strengthen tuberculosis control and thereby forestall tuberculosis and multidrug resistant tuberculosis epidemics. Positive findings on effectiveness of this innovative tuberculosis treatment people-centered approach will support its adoption in countries with similar healthcare and economic profiles.",CHHS,Public Health,2015.0
2-s2.0-84932625830,Conference Paper,"An anomaly detection problem is investigated, in which there are totally n sequences, with s anomalous sequences to be detected. Each normal sequence contains m independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples drawn from a distribution p, whereas each anomalous sequence contains m i.i.d. samples drawn from a distribution q that is distinct from p. The distributions p and q are assumed to be unknown a priori. The scenario with a reference sequence generated by p is studied. Distribution-free tests are constructed using maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) as the metric, which is based on mean embeddings of distributions into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). It is shown that as the number n of sequences goes to infinity, if the value of s is known, then the number m of samples in each sequence should be of order O(log n) or larger in order for the developed tests to consistently detect s anomalous sequences. If the value of s is unknown, then m should be of order strictly larger than O(log n). The computational complexity of all developed tests is shown to be polynomial. Numerical results demonstrate that these new tests outperform (or perform as well as) tests based on other competitive traditional statistical approaches and kernel-based approaches under various cases.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2014.0

The objective of this study was to determine if activity limitation and healthcare access are associated with frequent mental distress (FMD) in adults 65 years and older. Methods: Of the 123 427 study participants aged 65 years or older, 120 445 participants responded to the Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey question on number of mentally unhealthy days. Participants who reported having 14 or more mentally unhealthy days during the past 30 days were considered as having FMD. Activity limitation, avoidance of medical care due to cost, and availability of personal doctor were examined for their association with FMD in multivariable logistic regression analysis. Age, sex, race/ethnicity, marital and employment status, emotional support, and life satisfaction were included as potential confounders. Results: The prevalence of FMD in this study population was 6.5% (95% CI = 6.3-6.8) with estimates significantly greater among women (7.2%, 95% CI = 6.9-7.6) as compared to men (5.5%, 95% CI = 5.1-6.0). The odds of FMD were more than 2-fold elevated for those who reported activity limitations due to physical, mental, or emotional problems (adjusted OR = 2.59, 95% CI = 2.33-2.87), and among those who reported health care cost as a barrier to see a doctor (adjusted OR = 2.14, 95% CI = 1.75-2.61).

While the importance of popularity information is well recognized in the literature, the use of the popularity information for mobile App services is still fragmented and under-explored. To this end, in this paper, we propose a sequential approach based on hidden Markov model (HMM) for modeling the popularity information of mobile Apps toward mobile App services. Specifically, we first propose a popularity based HMM (PHMM) to model the sequences of the heterogeneous popularity observations of mobile Apps. Then, we introduce a bipartite based method to precluster the popularity observations. This can help to learn the parameters and initial values of the PHMM efficiently. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the PHMM is a general model and can be applicable for various mobile App services, such as trend based App recommendation, rating and review spam detection, and ranking fraud detection. Finally, we validate our approach on two real-world data sets collected from the Apple Appstore. Experimental results clearly validate both the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed popularity modeling approach.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2015.0

In this paper, we turn this unpalatable phenomenon into a favorable one. We present Magicol, an indoor localization and tracking system that embraces the local disturbances of the geomagnetic field. We tackle the low discernibility of the magnetic field by vectorizing consecutive magnetic signals on a per-step basis, and use vectors to shape the particle distribution in the estimation process. Magicol can also incorporate WiFi signals to achieve much improved positioning accuracy for indoor environments with WiFi infrastructure. We perform an in-depth study on the fusion of magnetic and WiFi signals. We design a two-pass bidirectional particle filtering process for maximum accuracy, and propose an on-demand WiFi scan strategy for energy savings. We further propose a compliant-walking method for location database construction that drastically simplifies the site survey effort. We conduct extensive experiments at representative indoor environments, including an office building, an underground parking garage, and a supermarket in which Magicol achieved a 90 percentile localization accuracy of 5 m, 1 m, and 8 m, respectively, using the magnetic field alone.

As the applause faded for the El Charro de Oro's [The Golden Mariachi's] performance, an outburst of racialized twittering hit the cloud. Although we watched the series of events that surrounded Sebastian de la Cruz's performances from thousands of miles away and despite the geographic distance between San Antonio and our communities, we recognized the hit-and-run commentary as all too familiar. In Georgia and the Carolinas, increasingly corrosive rhetoric surrounds Latino immigration—creating great obstacles to academic achievement including the navigation of a postcolonial nativist American landscape of K-12 education that continues to fail minoritized youth. Or, as Flores and Loss (2010) surmised, “Immigration policies and practices have been, and continue to be, riddled with contradictions. Close to the center of this sometimes bloody and always controversial issue is a fundamental, indeed enduring, question: Who is an American and what sorts of education should all Americans enjoy?” (p. 403). With these questions in mind, we argue that given an ongoing Latino nativity shift marked by 2010 Census analyses, the continued framing of post-first generation Latinos as perpetual foreigners whose academic achievement depends simply on the remediation of their English language proficiency is symptomatic a “national myopia” (P. R. Portes & Salas, 2014). We conclude with the overarching proposition that educational policy paradigms for Latino achievement in and beyond the shifting demographics of the U.S. South need to be grounded in additive models of cultural identity development that advance inter-culturally distributed cognitions, attitudes, and affective-behavioral patterns that result in achieving broader, richer identities across a variety of social contexts.",Education,"Middle, Secondary, and K-12 Education",2015.0

2-s2.0-84934436146,Article,"The Distance Constraint Model (DCM) is an ensemble-based biophysical model that integrates thermodynamic and mechanical viewpoints of protein structure. The DCM outputs a large number of structural characterizations that collectively allow for Quantified Stability-Flexibility Relationships (QSFR) to be identified and compared across protein families. Using five metallo-β- lactamases (MBLs) as a representative set, we demonstrate how QSFR properties are both conserved and varied across protein families. Similar to our characterizations on other protein families, the backbone flexibility of the five MBLs are overall visually conserved, yet there are interesting specific quantitative differences. For example, the plasmid-encoded NDM-1 enzyme, which leads to a fast spreading drug-resistant version of Klebsiella pneumoniae, has several regions of significantly increased rigidity relative to the other four. In addition, the set of intramolecular couplings within NDM-1 are also atypical. While long-range couplings frequently vary significantly across protein families, NDM-1 is distinct because it has limited correlated flexibility, which is isolated within the active site S3/S4 and S11/H6 loops. These loops are flexibly correlated in the other members, suggesting it is important to function, but the others also have significant amounts of correlated flexibility throughout the rest of their structures.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2014.0

Based on 2964 announcements from 1985 to 2011, we find that joint ventures and strategic alliances create significant value for bondholders. The average two-month abnormal bond return is 0.64% for joint ventures and 0.70% for strategic alliances. We find no evidence of a wealth transfer between the bondholders and stockholders. We further explore the determinants of bond value creation through hypotheses on the synergy effect, the alleviation of financial constraints, and real options. The results of our study show that financial synergy is a main driver of bondholder wealth effects in joint ventures, while operating synergy is a dominant factor in strategic alliances. We also find evidence to support the real option hypothesis for both events.

'Time is brain' is a widely accepted concept in acute cerebrovascular disease treatment. Efficient and accurate computational framework for hemodynamic parameters estimation can save critical time for thrombolytic therapy. Meanwhile the high level of accumulated radiation dosage due to continuous image acquisition in CT perfusion (CTP) raised concerns on patient safety and public health. However, low-radiation leads to increased noise and artifacts which require more sophisticated and time-consuming algorithms for robust estimation.

Specifically, we present a tensor total-variation (TTV) technique which fuses the spatial correlation of the vascular structure and the temporal continuation of the blood signal flow. An efficient algorithm is proposed to find the solution with fast convergence and reduced computational complexity. Extensive evaluations are carried out in terms of sensitivity to noise levels, estimation accuracy, contrast preservation, and performed on digital perfusion phantom estimation, as well as in vivo clinical subjects. Our framework reduces the necessary radiation dose to only 8% of the original level and outperforms the state-of-art algorithms with peak signal-to-noise ratio improved by 32%.

This study explored the relationship of first-generation segregation (elementary and middle school racial composition) and second-generation segregation (racially correlated academic tracks) to reading and mathematics test scores of Grade 8 students who attended the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools (CMS) in 1997. At the time the data were collected, the district had been operating under a mandatory desegregation plan since the early 1970s, which it continued to do for another five years. While the majority of students attended desegregated schools for most of their CMS education, a portion of youth also experienced school- and classroom-level segregation. Survey data collected from 1,812 students in randomly selected language arts classes stratified by track from the district’s 24 middle schools were analyzed with multilevel modeling to examine the influence of school and classroom racial composition on standardized scores, controlling for student and family factors associated with school performance. Results indicate that school- and classroom-level racial segregation was negatively related to achievement. Beginning in elementary school, sequential experiences of first- and second-generation segregation likely triggered a cycle of cumulative disadvantage for respondents’ middle school educational outcomes.

Compared with traditional user feedbacks such as comments and ratings, these specific emotion annotations are more accurate for expressing users' personal emotions. In this paper, we propose to exploit these users' emotion annotations for online news in order to track the evolution of emotions, which plays an important role in various online services. A critical challenge is how to model emotions with respect to time spans. To this end, we propose a time-aware topic modeling perspective for solving this problem. Specifically, we first develop a model named emotion-Topic over Time (eToT), in which we represent the topics of news as a Beta distribution over time and a multinomial distribution over emotions. Whilee ToT can uncover the latent relationship among news, emotion and time directly, it cannot capture the dynamics of topics. Therefore, we further develop another model named emotion based Dynamic Topic Model (eDTM), where we explore the state space model for tracking the dynamics of topics. In addition, we demonstrate that both eToT and eDTM could enable several potential applications, such as emotion prediction, emotion-based news recommendations and emotion anomaly detections.

This problem has been traditionally addressed through the textual query. In other words, information retrieval techniques will be exploited based on the textual similarity between queries and textual representation of software artifacts, which is generated by collecting words from comments, identifiers, and descriptions of programs. However, in addition to these semantic information, there are rich information embedded in source codes themselves. These source codes, if analyzed properly, can be a rich source for enhancing the efforts of software artifact retrieval. To this end, in this paper, we develop a feature extraction method on source codes. Specifically, this method can capture both the inherent information in the source codes and the semantic information hidden in the comments, descriptions, and identifiers of the source codes. Moreover, we design a heterogeneous metric learning approach, which allows to integrate code features and text features into the same latent semantic space. This, in turn, can help to measure the artifact similarity by exploiting the joint power of both code and text features.

While a variety of features could be extracted from these data, these features are Interco related and redundant. Thus, selecting good features and integrating the feature selection into the fitting of a ranking model are essential. To this end, in this paper, we first strategically mine the fine-grained discrminative features from user reviews and moving behaviors, and then propose a probabilistic sparse pair wise ranking method for estates. Specifically, we first extract the explicit features from online user reviews which express users' opinions about point of interests (POIs) near an estate. We also mine the implicit features from offline moving behaviors from multiple perspectives (e.g., Direction, volume, velocity, heterogeneity, topic, popularity, etc.). Then we learn an estate ranking predictor by combining a pair wise ranking objective and a sparsity regularization in a unified probabilistic framework. And we develop an effective solution for the optimization problem. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation with real world estate related data, and the experimental results demonstrate the competitive performance of both features and the proposed model.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2015.0

In this paper, we provide a new view-angle to understand technology prospecting by studying the evolving distributions of technologies in the companies. Specifically, we first exploit topic models to learn technological context in the form of probabilistic distributions of assignees and locations from large-scale patent documents. Then, we develop a matching solution to measure the relationships between patent topics and the description documents of technology terms. In this way, we can obtain the distribution of technologies for each company. In addition, we are able to assess the technology prospecting of a company by a designed indicator, which allows to compare the levels of discrepancies between the emerging technology distributions available as Garner Hype Cycles and the distribution of technologies of the company. Finally, experimental results on real-world patent data show the effectiveness of our approach for technology prospecting.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2015.0
2-s2.0-84936946471,Conference Paper,"The management of large-scale distributed information systems relies on the effective use and modeling of monitoring data collected at various points in the distributed information systems. A promising approach is to discover invariant relationships among the monitoring data and generate invariant networks, where a node is a monitoring data source (metric) and a link indicates an invariant relationship between two monitoring data. Such an invariant network representation can help system experts to localize and diagnose the system faults by examining those broken invariant relationships and their related metrics, because system faults usually propagate among the monitoring data and eventually lead to some broken invariant relationships. However, at one time, there are usually a lot of broken links (invariant relationships) within an invariant network. Without proper guidance, it is difficult for system experts to manually inspect this large number of broken links. Thus, a critical challenge is how to effectively and efficiently rank metrics (nodes) of invariant networks according to the anomaly levels of metrics. The ranked list of metrics will provide system experts with useful guidance for them to localize and diagnose the system faults. To this end, we propose to model the nodes and the broken links as a Markov Random Field (MRF), and develop an iteration algorithm to infer the anomaly of each node based on belief propagation (BP). Finally, we validate the proposed algorithm on both real-world and synthetic data sets to illustrate its effectiveness.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2015.0

We show why the line orthogonality pattern does not hold in the spectral space for these two types of networks.

A central question on these platforms is how to align the right products with the right investors, thus helping investors to make better decisions. Along this line, tremendous efforts have been devoted to modeling the credits of products and borrowers from an economic perspective. However, these global models are only exploratory in nature and are not practical. In this paper, we focus on the personalized investment recommendation by reconstructing the two steps for investment decision making: what to buy and how much money to pay. Specifically, we first generate a candidate investment recommendation list for each investor that tackles 'what to buy' problem. In this process, we consider various unique properties of investment recommendation. Furthermore, according to the portfolio theory, we optimize the shares of each recommended candidate by incorporating the investments an investor currently holds, thus solving the 'how much money to pay' problem. Finally, extensive experimental results on a large-scale real world dataset show the effectiveness of our model under various evaluation metrics.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2015.0

We sequenced two mitochondrial and four nuclear markers from 146 specimens from Pacific islands, Australia, and Malesia. We also added 211 specimens representing a larger worldwide sample and performed a series of phylogenetic analyses and ancestral area reconstructions. Results indicate that the Pacific members of this group comprise several robust clades that have distinctly different biogeographical histories, and they suggest an important role for Australia as a source of Pacific colonizations. Malesian areas were recovered mostly in derived positions, and one lineage appears to be Neotropical. Phylogenetic hypotheses indicate that the orange, pan-Pacific form commonly identified as C.chloroticus Emery 1897 actually consists of two distantly related lineages. Also, the lineage on Hawai'i, which has been called C.variegatus (Smith, 1858), appears to be closely related to C.tortuganus Emery, 1895 in Florida and other lineages in the New World.

However, the operation of a domestic discount in regard to death penalty sentencing has been rarely examined. The current research uses a near-population of jury decisions in capital murder trials conducted in North Carolina from 1991 to 2009 (n = 800), and a series of logistic regression analyses to determine whether there is (a) a direct effect between offender'victim relationship (e.g., domestic, friend/acquaintance, and stranger) and jury decision making, and/or (b) whether domestic offender-victim relationship (as well as other offender'victim relationships) moderates the effect of legal and extralegal case characteristics on jury assessment of the death penalty. Our findings revealed no empirical support for a domestic discount whereby juries are less likely to impose death sentences in cases involving domestic homicides. However, substantial differences in predictors of death sentencing were found across offender'victim dyads; most notably, domestic homicide cases demonstrated the most legalistic model of jury decisions to impose death sentences.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Criminal Justice and Criminology,2015.0
2-s2.0-84937137083,Conference Paper,"State estimation plays a critically important role in ensuring the secure and reliable operation of the power grid. However, recent works have shown that the widely used weighted least squares (WLS) estimator, which uses several system wide measurements, is vulnerable to cyber attacks wherein an adversary can alter certain measurements to corrupt the estimator's solution, but evade the estimator's existing bad data detection algorithms and thus remain invisible to the system operator. Realistically, such a stealthy attack in its most general form has several constraints, particularly in terms of an adversary's knowledge and resources for achieving a desired attack outcome. In this light, we present a formal framework to systematically investigate the feasibility of stealthy attacks considering constraints of the adversary. In addition, unlike prior works, our approach allows the modeling of attacks on topology mappings, where an adversary can drastically strengthen stealthy attacks by intentionally introducing topology errors. Moreover, we show that this framework allows an operator to synthesize cost-effective countermeasures based on given resource constraints and security requirements in order to resist stealthy attacks. The proposed approach is illustrated on standard IEEE test cases.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2014.0

There is abundant literature on the topic of efficient planning of EMS systems (maximizing expected coverage or minimizing response time). Other objectives have been considered but the literature available is very sparse compared to efficiency-based works. Furthermore, while real size EMS systems have been studied, the use of exact models is usually hindered by the amount of computational time required to obtain solutions. We approach the planning of large-scale EMS systems including fairness considerations using a Tabu Search-based heuristic with an embedded approximation procedure for the queuing submodel.

2-s2.0-84937411240,Conference Paper,"In contrast to hard automation, flexible assembly using a general-purpose robot holds the promise of reducing costs and increasing productivity of small batch products as well as adaptivity to product changes. However, robotic assembly remains one of the most challenging problems in robotics research. In particular, it has to overcome uncertainty in the environment and the location of parts. This paper addresses how to estimate and correct part positioning uncertainties with respect to the assembly task by using the contact trajectory data collected during active part interaction. We first devise a nominal assembly motion sequence based on an approximate knowledge of the poses of the parts, which includes exploratory compliant moves for the purpose of parameter estimation. As the robot manipulator executes the nominal motion sequence, data collected during exploratory compliant moves are used to estimate part poses more accurately, and the improved information is used to update the subsequent assembly motion sequence to correct errors in the nominal plan. We implemented the strategy using a back-drivable Barrett WAM robotic arm without a force sensor and BarrettHand BH8-262.

A critical demand along this line is to predict the popularity of online serials, which can enable a wide range of applications, such as online advertising, and serial recommendation. However, compared with traditional online media such as user-generated content (UGC), online serials have unique characteristics of sequence dependence, release date dependence as well as unsynchronized update regularity. Therefore, the popularity prediction for online serials is a nontrivial task and still under-addressed. To this end, in this paper we present a comprehensive study for predicting the popularity of online serials with autoregressive models. Specifically, we first introduce a straightforward yet effective Naive Autoregressive (NAR) model based on the correlations of serial episodes. Furthermore, we develop a sophisticated model, namely Transfer Autoregressive (TAR) model, to capture the dynamic behaviors of audiences, which can achieve better prediction performance than the NAR model. Indeed, the two models can reveal the popularity generation from different perspectives. In addition, as a derivative of the TAR model, we also design a novel metric, namely favor, for evaluating the quality of online serials. Finally, extensive experiments on two real-world data sets clearly show that both models are effective and outperform baselines in terms of the popularity prediction for online serials.

Many spam detection schemes have been proposed employing the tendency of spam to alter the normal statistical behavior of mail traffic. Threshold tuning of these detectors is still a challenging task. Since, shooting down benign emails as spam (false positive), in pursuit of higher detection rates, can be detrimental. In this paper, we introduce a novel economic metric, based on the underlying spam economic system, to assist detectors in keeping their false positives at bay by associating detection accuracy to the spammer's cost. Hence, the sensitivity of a detector does not need to be tuned all the way up to maximize detection, but enough to make spamming cost unbearable to the spammer. Since, spam is all about making money ultimately. Our evaluation shows the effectiveness of this approach in considerably reducing the false positives for the detectors.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2014.0

Researchers have reported that patients with CAI are restricted occupationally, have more functional limitations, and have a poorer health-related quality of life. We do not know if these limitations decrease physical activity levels. Objective: To assess total weekly steps taken between persons with CAI and persons with healthy ankles. Design: Case-control study. Setting: University research laboratory. Patients or Other Participants: A total of 20 participants with unilateral CAI (9 men, 11 women; age = 21.2 ± 1.9 years, height=174.3 ± 6.9 cm, mass=71.9 ± 11.7 kg) and 20 healthy participants (9 men, 11 women; age=20.4 ± 2.1 years, height= 172.1 ± 5.5 cm, mass = 73.1 ± 13.4 kg) volunteered. Main Outcome Measure(s): We provided all participants with a pedometer and instructed them to wear it every day for 7 days and to complete a daily step log. They also completed the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM), the FAAM Sport version, and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. A 2-way analysis of variance (group3sex) was used to determine if differences existed in the total number of weekly steps, ankle laxity, and answers on the International Physical Activity Questionnaire between groups and between sexes. Results: We found no group3sex interaction for step count (F range = 0.439-2.108, P =.08). A main effect for group was observed (F<inf>1,38</inf> = 10.45, P =.04). The CAI group took fewer steps than the healthy group (P =.04). The average daily step count was 6694.47 ± 1603.35 for the CAI group and 8831.01 ± 1290.01 for the healthy group. The CAI group also scored lower on the FAAM (P =.01) and the FAAM Sport version (P =.01). Conclusions: The decreased step count that the participants with CAI demonstrated is concerning.

The decision to breastfeed may be influenced by the opinions of family and friends. Objective: This study aimed to examine the relationship between maternal perception of the infant feeding preferences of the baby's father and the maternal grandmother and the woman's intention to breastfeed. Methods: This study analyzed data from the Infant Feeding Practices Survey II (2005-2007). Results: The sample included 4690 women, of whom approximately 82% were white, 67% were married, 68% were multiparous, and 66% had some college education or beyond.

Since the users utilize their own knowledge and personalized language to describe the visual content of social images, these social tags are too imprecise and ambiguous to exploit the social image tagging. In this paper, we discover the content-similar images (peers) and leverage the relationships among these images (peer cooperation) to handle the problem of content-irrelevant tags. A bi-layer clustering framework for discovering content-similar images is proposed to divide image collection into different groups, and the tags of peers in these groups are cleaned jointly based on tag statistics and relevance. The relevance of tags measured by Google Distance is used to generate the first-layer clustering and then the bi-modality similarity of images is used to perform the second-layer clustering. Based on the bi-layer clustering, we utilize peers in a group to identify their content-irrelevant tags.

Such benefits would be higher if there are richer knowledge resources in a DM subsidiary or in a DM local network. Such benefits would also increase over time because of the accumulation of new knowledge back home. Using a sample of 1,303 complete domestic acquisitions made by 713 Turkish firms over the period of 1987-2013, including 196 deals involving a springboard FDI strategy, we have found highly supportive empirical evidence.

2-s2.0-84937682663,Conference Paper,"State estimation plays a critically important role in ensuring the secure and reliable operation of the electric grid. Recent works have shown that the state estimation process is vulnerable to stealthy attacks where an adversary can alter certain measurements to corrupt the solution of the process, but evade the existing bad data detection algorithms and remain invisible to the system operator. Since the state estimation result is used to compute optimal power flow and perform contingency analysis, incorrect estimation can undermine economic and secure system operation. However, an adversary needs sufficient resources as well as necessary knowledge to achieve a desired attack outcome. The knowledge that is required to launch an attack mainly includes the measurements considered in state estimation, the connectivity among the buses, and the power line admittances. Uncertainty in information limits the potential attack space for an attacker. This advantage of uncertainty enables us to apply moving target defense (MTD) strategies for developing a proactive defense mechanism for state estimation. In this paper, we propose an MTD mechanism for securing state estimation, which has several characteristics: (i) increase the knowledge uncertainty for attackers, (ii) reduce the window of attack opportunity, and (iii) increase the attack cost. In this mechanism, we apply controlled randomization on the power grid system properties, mainly on the set of measurements that are considered in state estimation, and the topology, especially the line admittances.

2-s2.0-84937692873,Conference Paper,"The static one-to-one binding of hosts to IP addresses allows adversaries to conduct thorough reconnaissance in order to discover and enumerate network assets. Specifically, this fixed address mapping allows distributed network scanners to aggregate information gathered at multiple locations over different times in order to construct an accurate and persistent view of the network. The unvarying nature of this view enables adversaries to collaboratively share and reuse their collected reconnaissance information in various stages of attack planning and execution. This paper presents a novel moving target defense (MTD) technique which enables host-to-IP binding of each destination host to vary randomly across the network based on the source identity (spatial randomization) as well as time (temporal randomization). This spatio-temporal randomization will distort attackers' view of the network by causing the collected reconnaissance information to expire as adversaries transition from one host to another or if they stay long enough in one location. Consequently, adversaries are forced to re-scan the network frequently at each location or over different time intervals. These recurring probings significantly raises the bar for the adversaries by slowing down the attack progress, while improving its detectability. We introduce three novel metrics for quantifying the effectiveness of MTD defense techniques: deterrence, deception, and detectability. Using these metrics, we perform rigorous theoretical and experimental analysis to evaluate the efficacy of this approach. These analyses show that our approach is effective in countering a significant number of sophisticated threat models including collaborative reconnaissance, worm propagation, and advanced persistent threat (APT), in an evasion-free manner.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2014.0

Design/methodology/approach – The study uses self-congruency theory and perception of fit to explore the influence of green advertising and social activism on attitudes toward BP’s advertising, commitment to the environment, brand, and company. The survey data cover periods before, during, and after the spill. Findings – Mean ratings for the BP brand were lower during the oil spill for respondents who viewed an environmental ad as compared to those viewing an ad lacking environmental content. Comparison of attitudes toward BP’s environmental commitment, advertising, company, and brand reveal differences between activist and non-activist respondents across all four attitudinal scales during the oil spill. Practical implications – The study finds that lack of fit between corporate social responsibility communications and social responsibility performance raises the potential for a significant backlash against BP.

Although physical activity benefits cognitive function in noncancer populations, evidence linking physical activity to cognitive function in cancer survivors is limited. In our recent randomized controlled trial, breast cancer survivors who received a yoga intervention had lower fatigue and inflammation following the trial compared with a wait list control group. This secondary analysis of the parent trial addressed yoga's impact on cognitive complaints. Methods Posttreatment stage 0-IIIA breast cancer survivors (n = 200) were randomized to a 12-week, twice-weekly Hatha yoga intervention or a wait list control group. Participants reported cognitive complaints using the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial Cognitive Problems Scale at baseline, immediately postintervention, and 3-month follow-up. Results Cognitive complaints did not differ significantly between groups immediately postintervention (p = 0.250). However, at 3-month follow-up, yoga participants' Breast Cancer Prevention Trial Cognitive Problems Scale scores were an average of 23% lower than wait list participants' scores (p = 0.003). These group differences in cognitive complaints remained after controlling for psychological distress, fatigue, and sleep quality. Consistent with the primary results, those who practiced yoga more frequently reported significantly fewer cognitive problems at 3-month follow-up than those who practiced less frequently (p < 0.001).

The semi-supervised learning method based on hypergraph model can achieve multi-semantics labels, but a hypergraph model is sensitive to the radius parameter when it is constructed and the number of vertices belonging to a hyperedge is fixed. In this paper, a semi-supervised incremental learning method based on adaptive probabilistic hypergraph for video semantic detection is presented. In the probabilistic hypergraph modeling, a formula is presented as a measurement to adaptively decide whether a vertex is belonged to a hyperedge or not. The model has high robustness and can overcome the defect of fixed number of vertices belonging to the same hyperedge in the traditional probabilistic hypergraph model. In the semi-supervised incremental learning process, a threshold is defined, which is used to judge whether unlabeled sample can be added into the modeling, in order that the model learning result for unlabeled samples has high certainty.

2-s2.0-84937886705,"General Publications (Press, Editorials, Letters)","Many of today’s online news Web sites have enabled users to specify different types of emotions (e.g., angry or shocked) they have after reading news. Compared with traditional user feedbacks such as comments and ratings, these specific emotion annotations are more accurate for expressing users’ personal emotions. In this paper, we propose to exploit these users’ emotion annotations for online news in order to track the evolution of emotions, which plays an important role in various online services. A critical challenge is how to model emotions with respect to time spans. To this end, we propose a time-aware topic modeling perspective for solving this problem. Specifically, we first develop two models named emotion-Topic over Time (eToT) and mixed emotion-Topic over Time (meToT), in which the topics of news are represented as a beta distribution over time and a multinomial distribution over emotions. While they can uncover the latent relationship among news, emotion and time directly, they cannot capture the evolution of topics. Therefore, we further develop another model named emotion-based Dynamic Topic Model (eDTM), where we explore the state space model for tracking the evolution of topics. In addition, we demonstrate that all of proposed models could enable several potential applications, such as emotion prediction, emotion-based news recommendations, and emotion anomaly detections. Finally, we validate the proposed models with extensive experiments with a real-world data set.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2015.0

To improve characterizing forest canopies with TLS, we forged a methodological paradigm that combines physics and statistics to derive foliage profile, leaf area index (LAI), and leaf angle distribution (LAD): We modeled laser-vegetation interactions probabilistically and then developed a maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of vegetation parameters. Unlike classical gap-based algorithms, MLE explicitly accommodates laser scanning geometries, fully leverages raw laser ranging data, and simultaneously derives foliage profile and LAD. We evaluated MLE using both synthetic lidar data and real TLS scans at sites in Everglades National Park, USA. Estimated LAI differed between algorithms by an average of 26%. Compared to classical gap analyses, MLE derived foliage density profile and LAD more accurately. Also, MLE has a rigorous statistical foundation and generated error intervals better indicative of the true uncertainties of estimated canopy parameters-an aspect often overlooked but essential for credible use of lidar vegetation products. The theoretical justification and experimental evidence converge to suggest that classical gap methods are sub-optimal for exploiting tiny-footprint lidar data and MLE offers a paradigm-shifting alternative. We envision that MLE will further boost confident use of terrestrial lidar as a versatile tool for environmental applications, such as forest survey, ecological conservation, and ecosystem management.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2015.0
2-s2.0-84938149461,Conference Paper,"One of the most significant challenges facing engineering education in the United States is the persistent problem of inclusion and retention of underrepresented racial and ethnic groups. As part of a larger, federally funded project on student-faculty interaction in engineering, a case study was conducted to describe engineering-related interactions prior to college, perceived barriers during engineering studies, and early expectations of interactions with faculty among first year Black and Latino engineering students at a large university in the Southeastern United States. Descriptive data were gathered through focus groups and questionnaires. Findings indicated that recommendations from pre-college educators, mostly middle and high school math and science teachers, were important for deciding to study engineering in college. Students had expectations of minimal contact with engineering faculty based on early interactions, but expressed the desire to seek relationships with professors who would be able to connect them with engineering-related opportunities and resources. The most likely perceived barriers to studying engineering were financial problems and difficulties in science and engineering coursework. These findings are particularly useful to engineering education professionals involved with first year orientation experiences, and they further current understanding about pre-college and early experiences that are linked to engineering enrollment.",Education,Educational Leadership,2015.0

Incorporating a PV system onto a campus building would help offset energy costs. UNC Charlotte identified the Colvard building roof as a promising candidate for solar panels. In this paper, the feasibility of placing a PV array on the roof is investigated. Six system configurations were identified as: (i) micro-inverter and grid tie (ii) micro-inverter with grid tie and battery backup (iii) micro-inverter and battery (stand-Alone), (iv) central/string inverter with grid-Tie, (v) central/string inverter with grid tie and battery backup, (vi) central/string inverter and battery (stand-Alone). The designs were systematically eliminated based on the benefits of (a) micro-inverters, (b) battery bank, (c) AC coupling and (d) grid interconnections. Micro-inverters were ruled beneficial based on literature review and also the expansion opportunities they afforded. The battery bank was ruled unnecessary based on power reliability data obtained from Facilities Management. AC coupling was also deemed an inefficient way to couple a battery bank based on both cost and losses in efficiency. A grid tie was chosen over a stand-Alone setup due to the power reliability of on-campus power and the unjustified cost a battery bank posed. Thus, the study found that a grid-Tie system with micro-inverters is the most suitable configuration for the Colvard roof space at UNC Charlotte. The study also found that laying the PV panels flat maximized yearly power output for the roof. A novel way to mount the panels by point-loading was devised, allowing additional weight to be added without compromising the roof's structural integrity.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2015.0

Given that property data often omits information on quality differences between same-aged homes as well as changes in structural attributes over time, researchers must assume that property renovations are uncorrelated with neighborhood amenities. We formally test if this assumption is valid by incorporating detailed data on renovations in Charlotte, North Carolina. We begin by testing how the inclusion of minor and major home improvements influences hedonic and repeat sales indices. Results find limited bias in hedonic indices and that renovated properties are no more likely to be sold than nonrenovated properties. Using the introduction of Charlotte's light rail-transit system in 2000, we estimate a positive bias of between 1.6% and 19.9% on the capitalized benefits of access to light rail due to omitted information on renovations. Our results show that a number of common data cleaning techniques used to address missing information on structural improvements may worsen this bias.",Business,Economics,2015.0

We focus on immigration attitudes in Africa, which has been overlooked in existing literature and where there is wide variation on political factors. Drawing on existing case study literature that links exclusionary politics in that region to on-going processes of political liberalisation, we hypothesise that political competition heightens opposition to immigration by raising the salience of the issue and legitimising hostile attitudes. Using multilevel mixed-effect ordered logistic regression analysis with survey data from African countries, we find that opposition to immigration is significantly higher among individuals in countries that are more democratic, that have dominant party systems, and when the survey is conducted shortly before or after a national election. Our analysis also shows that opposition to immigration is more likely in African countries with higher levels of ethnic diversity and higher levels of economic development. In addition to raising important questions for future cross-regional research, our findings from Africa suggest a need to re-think broader comparative theories about immigration attitudes and to give greater attention to the role of political competition in shaping public opinion.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Political Science and Public Administration,2015.0
2-s2.0-84938554477,Article,"Abstract Networks are commonly used to model traffic patterns, social interactions, or web pages. The vertices in a network do not possess the same characteristics: some vertices are naturally more connected and some vertices can be more important. Closeness centrality (CC) is a global metric that quantifies how important is a given vertex in the network. When the network is dynamic and keeps changing, the relative importance of the vertices also changes. The best known algorithm to compute the CC scores makes it impractical to recompute them from scratch after each modification. In this paper, we propose Streamer, a distributed memory framework for incrementally maintaining the closeness centrality scores of a network upon changes. It leverages pipelined, replicated parallelism, and SpMM-based BFSs, and it takes NUMA effects into account. It makes maintaining the closeness centrality values of real-life networks with millions of interactions significantly faster and obtains almost linear speedups on a 64 nodes 8 threads/node cluster.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2015.0

The purpose of this study was to understand internal facilitation activities in implementing a national safe patient handling program from the perspective of facility coordinators who implemented the program. Methods: Using a qualitative descriptive design, data were collected in five focus groups at two international Safe Patient Handling and Mobility Conferences. Participants were 38 facility coordinators implementing a safe patient handling program in the Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers throughout the United States. Data were analyzed using direct content analysis to gather descriptions of internal facilitation. Results: The internal facilitation process involved engaging multiple disciplines and levels of leadership for implementation. Fifty-four facilitation activities were identified, including five activities not currently listed in an existing taxonomy. Key characteristics and skills of facilitators included persistence, credibility and clinical experience, and leadership and project management experience. Themes were mapped onto an existing framework and taxonomy of facilitation activities. Linking Evidence to Action: Internal facilitation is both an implementation intervention and a process involving a wide range of activities.

2-s2.0-84938603500,Article,"Background Schistosoma japonicum causes major public health problems in China and the Philippines; this parasite, which is transmitted by freshwater snails of the species Oncomelania hupensis, causes the disease intestinal schistosomiasis in humans and cattle. Researchers working on Schistosoma in Africa have described the relationship between the parasites and their snail intermediate hosts as coevolved or even as an evolutionary arms race. In the present study this hypothesis of coevolution is evaluated for S. japonicum and O. hupensis. The origins and radiation of the snails and the parasite across China, and the taxonomic validity of the sub-species of O. hupensis, are also assessed. Methodology/Principal Findings The findings provide no evidence for coevolution between S. japonicum and O. hupensis, and the phylogeographical analysis suggests a heterochronous radiation of the parasites and snails in response to different palaeogeographical and climatic triggers. The results are consistent with a hypothesis of East to West colonisation of China by Oncomelania with a re-invasion of Japan by O. hupensis from China. The Taiwan population of S. japonicum appears to be recently established in comparison with mainland Chinese populations. Conclusions/Significance The snail and parasite populations of the western mountain region of China (Yunnan and Sichuan) appear to have been isolated from Southeast Asian populations since thePleistocene; this has implications for road and rail links being constructed in the region, which will breach biogeographical barriers between China and Southeast Asia. The results also have implications for the spread of S. japonicum. In the absence of coevolution, the parasite may more readily colonise new snail populations to which it is not locally adapted, or even new intermediate host species; this can facilitate its dispersal into new areas. Additional work is required to assess further the risk of spread of S. Japonicum.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2015.0
2-s2.0-84938632824,Article,"The effects of somatic mutations that transform polyspecific germline (GL) antibodies to affinity mature (AM) antibodies with monospecificity are compared among three GL-AM Fab pairs. In particular, changes in conformational flexibility are assessed using a Distance Constraint Model (DCM). We have previously established that the DCM can be robustly applied across a series of antibody fragments (VL to Fab), and subsequently, the DCM was combined with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to similarly characterize five thermostabilizing scFv mutants. The DCM is an ensemble based statistical mechanical approach that accounts for enthalpy/entropy compensation due to network rigidity, which has been quite successful in elucidating conformational flexibility and Quantitative Stability/Flexibility Relationships (QSFR) in proteins. Applied to three disparate antibody systems changes in QSFR quantities indicate that the VH domain is typically rigidified, whereas the VL domain and CDR L2 loop become more flexible during affinity maturation. The increase in CDR H3 loop rigidity is consistent with other studies in the literature. The redistribution of conformational flexibility is largely controlled by nonspecific changes in the H-bond network, although certain Arg to Asp salt bridges create highly localized rigidity increases. Taken together, these results reveal an intricate flexibility/rigidity response that accompanies affinity maturation.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2015.0

Despite the inherent limitations, data on administrative claims may provide an opportunity to investigate adherence to these programs. Methods: We assessed adherence to liver function test (LFT) requirements included in the REMS program for bosentan through use of administrative claims. Patients observed in the Optum Research Database who were initiators of bosentan from November 20, 2001 to March 31, 2013 were included. Adherence to LFTs was calculated using pharmacy claims for bosentan dispensation and medical claims for laboratory services, and was assessed at the time of drug initiation and within specified time intervals throughout follow-up. Results: Of 742 patients, 523 (70.5%) had >1 qualifying LFT. Among patients with ≥12 dispensations, claims for LFTs at individual dispensations were 53.2-64.0%. Median proportion of dispensations with ≥1 LFT was 0.8 among patients with ≥6 (interquartile range, 0.7-1.0) or ≥12 (0.7-0.9) dispensations. Adherence was 90-100% for 33.3% of all initiators, whereas 29.3% of initiators were non-adherent (defined as <50% of on-therapy LFTs).

Methods: We identified children and adolescents (aged ≤20 years) with CCCs, cachexia, and debility in the Kids' Inpatient Database [Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, Agency for Healthcare Research & Quality]. We then compared the characteristics of patients and hospitalizations, including cost and duration of stay, for CCCs with and without cachexia and/or debility. We examined factors that predict risk of inpatient mortality in children and adolescents with CCCs using a logistic regression model. We examined factors that impact duration of stay and cost in children and adolescents with CCCs using negative binomial regression models. All costs are reported in US dollars in 2014 using Consumer Price Index inflation adjustment. Results: We estimated the incidence of hospitalization of cachexia in children and adolescents with CCCs at 1,395 discharges during the sample period, which ranged from 277 discharges in 2003 to 473 discharges in 2012. We estimated the incidence of hospitalization due to debility in children and adolescents with CCCs at 421 discharges during the sample period, which ranged from 39 discharges in 2003 to 217 discharges in 2012. Cachexia was associated with a 60% increase in the risk of inpatient mortality, whereas debility was associated with a 40% decrease in the risk of mortality. Cachexia and debility increased duration of stay in hospital (17% and 39% longer stays, respectively). Median cost of hospitalization was $15,441.59 and $23,796.16 for children and adolescents with cachexia and debility, respectively. Conclusions: Incidence of hospitalization for cachexia in children and adolescents with CCCs is less than that for adults but the frequency of cachexia diagnoses increased over time. Estimates of the incidence of hospitalization with debility in children and adolescents with CCCs have not been reported, but our study demonstrates that the frequency of these discharges is also increasing.",CHHS,Kinesiology,2015.0
2-s2.0-84938808635,Article,"Background: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a progressive genetic disorder characterized by the development of numerous kidney cysts that result in kidney failure. Little is known regarding the key patient characteristics and utilization of healthcare resources for ADPKD patients along the continuum of disease progression. This observational study was designed to describe the characteristics of ADPKD patients and compare them with those of patients with other chronic kidney diseases. Methods: This retrospective cohort study involved patients with a claim for ADPKD or PKD unspecified from 1/1/2000-2/28/2013 and ≥6 months of previous continuous enrollment (baseline) within a large database of administrative claims in the USA. A random sample of chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients served as comparators. For a subset of ADPKD patients who had only a diagnosis code of unspecified PKD, abstraction of medical records was undertaken to estimate the proportion of patients who had medical chart-confirmed ADPKD. In patients with linked electronic laboratory data, the estimated glomerular filtration rate was calculated via serum creatinine values to determine CKD stage at baseline and during follow-up. Proportions of patients transitioning to another stage and the mean age at transition were calculated. Results: ADPKD patients were, in general, younger and had fewer physician visits, but had more specific comorbidities at observation start compared with CKD patients. ADPKD patients had a longer time in the milder stages and longer duration before recorded transition to a more severe stage compared with CKD patients. Patients with ADPKD at risk of rapid progression had a shorter time-to-end-stage renal disease than patients with CKD and ADPKD patients not at risk, but stage duration was similar between ADPKD patients at risk and those not at risk. Conclusions: These results suggest that distribution of patients by age at transition to next stage may be useful for identification of ADPKD patients at risk of rapid progression. The results also suggest that medical claims with diagnosis codes for ""unspecified PKD"", in absence of a diagnosis code for autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease, may be a good proxy for ADPKD.",CHHS,Public Health,2015.0

Results indicated that all eight textbooks presented mixed views of scientific methodology in their initial descriptions. Five textbooks emphasized the stereotypical “scientific method,” while the other three placed more emphasis on the more appropriate view that scientists use a variety of methods when conducting investigations. Results also revealed that the initial descriptions, examples, and investigations were inconsistent in six of the eight textbooks.

How transcription factors achieve high binding specificity is still not well understood. In this paper, we investigated the role of protein flexibility in protein-DNA-binding specificity by comparative molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Protein flexibility has been considered as a key factor in molecular recognition, which is intrinsically a dynamic process involving fine structural fitting between binding components. In this study, we performed comparative MD simulations on wild-type and F10V mutant P22 Arc repressor in both free and complex conformations. The F10V mutant has lower DNA-binding specificity though both the bound and unbound main-chain structures between the wild-type and F10V mutant Arc are highly similar. We found that the DNA-binding motif of wild-type Arc is structurally more flexible than the F10V mutant in the unbound state, especially for the six DNA base-contacting residues in each dimer. We demonstrated that the flexible side chains of wild-type Arc lead to a higher DNA-binding specificity through forming more hydrogen bonds with DNA bases upon binding. Our simulations also showed a possible conformational selection mechanism for Arc-DNA binding.

Two user studies were conducted to show that our simultaneous 7DOF interaction technique outperforms a previous two-handed technique as well as a one-handed scene-in-hand technique for a 7DOF travel task.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2015.0
2-s2.0-84939136624,Article,"In this study, we develop a multi-layered hinterland classification of major Indian ports for containerized shipments using a novel approach that integrates geographic information system visualizations and data mining methods. Strong export-oriented business sectors and growing industrial diversity have been prompting developing economies like India to move towards the containerization of maritime transport. We recognize the dearth of systematic research on Indian ports' hinterlands and therefore seek to understand how the hinterland of container shipping markets in India has evolved in recent years, within the context of ongoing privatization and modernization efforts in this sector. Using disaggregate shipping data of exports from India to the United States, we conduct origin-destination analysis to describe the patterns of container traffic flows from major Indian ports. Furthermore, we develop a decision tree model of hinterland structure and overlap that explains the nature of inter-port competition from three dimensions: space, commodity types and shipment values. This article also attempts to assess the competition posed by private ports like Mundra and Pipavav on major Government ports, for which data have largely been unavailable. The results demonstrate the utility of this data mining method in conceptualizing the port hinterland as a dynamic spatial object and in unravelling multidimensional relationships.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2015.0

With the negative conse-quences of physical inactivity well established, understanding the effect of an ankle sprain on this outcome is critical. The objective of this study was to measure physical activity across the lifespan after a single ankle sprain in an animal model. Thir-ty male mice (CBA/J) were randomly placed into one of three groups: the transected calcaneofibular ligament (CFL) group, the transected anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL)/CFL group, and a SHAM group. Three days after surgery, all of the mice were individually housed in a cage containing a solid surface running wheel. Physical activity levels were recorded and aver-aged every week across the mouse’s lifespan. The SHAM mice ran significantly more distance each day compared to the re-maining two running groups (post hoc p = 0.011). Daily dura-tion was different between the three running groups (p = 0.048). The SHAM mice ran significantly more minutes each day com-pared to the remaining two running groups (post hoc p=0.046) while the ATFL/CFL mice ran significantly less minutes each day (post hoc p = 0.028) compared to both the SHAM and CFL only group. The SHAM mice ran at a faster daily speed versus the remaining two groups of mice (post hoc p = 0.019) and the ATFL/CFL mice ran significantly slower each day compared to the SHAM and CFL group (post hoc p = 0.005). The results of this study indicate that a single ankle sprain significantly de-creases physical activity across the lifespan in mice. This de-crease in physical activity can potentially lead to the develop-ment of numerous chronic diseases. An ankle sprain thus has the potential to lead to significant long term health risks if not treated appropriately.",CHHS,Kinesiology,2015.0

Monitoring drug efficacy in 2-year intervals is an important tool for establishing rational anti-malarial drug policies. This study addresses the therapeutic efficacy of artemether-lumefantrine (AL) for the treatment of Plasmodium falciparum in southwestern Ethiopia. Methods: A 28-day in vivo therapeutic efficacy study was conducted from September to December, 2011, in southwestern Ethiopia. Participants were selected for the study if they were older than 6 months, weighed more than 5 kg, symptomatic, and had microscopically confirmed, uncomplicated P. falciparum. All 93 eligible patients were treated with AL and followed for 28 days. For each patient, recurrence of parasitaemia, the clinical condition, and the presence of gametoytes were assessed on each visit during the follow-up period. PCR was conducted to differentiate re-infection from recrudescence. Results: Seventy-four (83.1 %) of the study subjects cleared fever by day 1, but five (5.6 %) had fever at day 2. All study subjects cleared fever by day 3. Seventy-nine (88.8 %) of the study subjects cleared the parasite by day 1, seven (7.9 %) were blood-smear positive by day 1, and three (3.4 %) were positive by day 2. In five patients (5.6 %), parasitaemia reappeared during the 28-day follow-up period. From these five, one (1.1 %) was a late clinical failure, and four (4.5 %) were a late parasitological failure. On the day of recurrent parasitaemia, the level of chloroquine/desethylchloroquine (CQ-DCQ) was above the minimum effective concentration (>100 ng/ml) in one patient. There were 84 (94.4 %) adequate clinical and parasitological responses. The 28-day, PCR-uncorrected (unadjusted by genotyping) cure rate was 84 (94.4 %), whereas the 28-day, PCR-corrected cure rate was 87 (97.8 %). Of the three re-infections, two (2.2 %) were due to P. falciparum and one (1.1 %) was due to P. vivax. From 89 study subjects, 12 (13.5 %) carried P. falciparum gametocytes at day 0, whereas the 28-day gametocyte carriage rate was 2 (2.2 %). Conclusions: Years after the introduction of AL in Ethiopia, the finding of this study is that AL has been highly effective in the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria and reducing gametocyte carriage in southwestern Ethiopia.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2015.0
2-s2.0-84939178645,Conference Paper,"Extending the position of a 3D virtual cursor that represents the location of a physical tracking input device in the virtual world often enhances efficiency and usability of 3D user interactions. Most previous studies, however, tend to focus on evaluating cursor offset techniques for specific types of interactions, mainly object selection and manipulation. Furthermore, not many studies address cursor offset techniques for multi-display virtual environments, such as a Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE), which require different directions of the cursor offset for different displays. This paper presents two formal user studies that evaluate effects of varying offset techniques on navigation tasks in a CAVE system. The first study compares four offset techniques: no offset, fixed-length offset, nonlinear offset and linear offset. The results indicate that the linear offset technique outperforms other techniques for exocentric travel tasks. The second study investigates the influence of three different offset lengths in the linear offset technique on the same task.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2015.0

Identifying genes involved in synthesis of bioactive compounds could enable the breeding of berry varieties with enhanced health benefits.Results: Toward this end, we annotated a previously sequenced draft blueberry genome assembly using RNA-Seq data from five stages of berry fruit development and ripening. Genome-guided assembly of RNA-Seq read alignments combined with output from ab initio gene finders produced around 60,000 gene models, of which more than half were similar to proteins from other species, typically the grape Vitis vinifera. Comparison of gene models to the PlantCyc database of metabolic pathway enzymes identified candidate genes involved in synthesis of bioactive compounds, including bixin, an apocarotenoid with potential disease-fighting properties, and defense-related cyanogenic glycosides, which are toxic. Cyanogenic glycoside (CG) biosynthetic enzymes were highly expressed in green fruit, and a candidate CG detoxification enzyme was up-regulated during fruit ripening. Candidate genes for ethylene, anthocyanin, and 400 other biosynthetic pathways were also identified. Homology-based annotation using Blast2GO and InterPro assigned Gene Ontology terms to around 15,000 genes. RNA-Seq expression profiling showed that blueberry growth, maturation, and ripening involve dynamic gene expression changes, including coordinated up- and down-regulation of metabolic pathway enzymes and transcriptional regulators. Analysis of RNA-seq alignments identified developmentally regulated alternative splicing, promoter use, and 3' end formation.Conclusions: We report genome sequence, gene models, functional annotations, and RNA-Seq expression data that provide an important new resource enabling high throughput studies in blueberry.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2015.0

We argue that when employees feel angry, guilty, joyous, or proud at work, those with higher levels of ability-based emotional intelligence will turn to emotion-focused coping as a means to deal with the immediate aftermath of the emotion. This form of coping requires the least amount of cognitive resources and facilitates performance by helping individuals to meet their task demands.

In recent years, the data suggest convergence stopped and it may have reversed. This study finds that the conclusion depends on the way states are grouped. Analysis of quintiles based on 1950 PCPI shows convergence until 1990 and a relatively constant dispersion thereafter. Quintiles based on 2012 PCPI show substantial divergence after 2000. This paper also analyzes the changes in state PCPI ranking over time. Between 1950 and 2012, eleven states experienced a double-digit increase in rank while ten states had a double-digit decline in rank. A regression model using both variable and fixed factors that affect PCPI indicates that state population growth had a negative and significant effect on state PCPI rank and higher rates of four-year college graduates had a positive and significant effect. Finally, location in the Southeast, Rocky Mountain, and Far West regions had a negative and significant effect on state PCPI ranking.",Business,Economics,2015.0
2-s2.0-84939496346,Article,"In this paper, a hierarchical multi-task structural learning algorithm is developed to support large-scale plant species identification, where a visual tree is constructed for organizing large numbers of plant species in a coarse-to-fine fashion and determining the inter-related learning tasks automatically. For a given parent node on the visual tree, it contains a set of sibling coarse-grained categories of plant species or sibling fine-grained plant species, and a multi-task structural learning algorithm is developed to train their inter-related classifiers jointly for enhancing their discrimination power. The inter-level relationship constraint, e.g., a plant image must first be assigned to a parent node (high-level non-leaf node) correctly if it can further be assigned to the most relevant child node (low-level non-leaf node or leaf node) on the visual tree, is formally defined and leveraged to learn more discriminative tree classifiers over the visual tree.

Nevertheless, both PBCD and OBCD have disadvantages, and classical HCD methods belong to intuitive decision-level fusion schemes of PBCD and OBCD. There is no optimum HCD method as of yet. Analyzing the complementarities of PBCD and OBCD method, we propose a new unsupervised algorithm-level fusion scheme (UAFS-HCD) in this paper to improve the accuracy of PBCD using spatial context information through: 1) getting the preliminary change mask with PBCD at first to estimate some parameters for OBCD; 2) deriving the unchanged area mask to eliminate the areas without changes, reducing error amplification phenomenon of OBCD; and 3) obtaining the final change mask by means of OBCD method. Taking flood detection with multitemporal SAR data as an example, we compared the new scheme with some classical methods, including PBCD, OBCD, and HCD method and supervised manual trial-and-error procedure (MTEP).

Despite this, there has been no study to date on Barred Owl-vehicle collisions, a species that breeds in densely-populated suburban neighborhoods with high road density. We capitalized on the availability of a large dataset of the locations of Barred Owls hit by vehicles and brought to a rehabilitation center in Charlotte, North Carolina, USA to investigate the factors underlying collision incidence. Using autologistic regressions and multi-model inference, we found that the explanatory variables with the largest effects on the likelihood of a Barred Owl-vehicle collision were speed limit, road width, and habitat suitability within 825 m of roads, in that order. Speed limit and habitat suitability had positive effects whereas road width had a negative effect. Our results are in agreement with existing studies of birds that have investigated the relative effects of road features and landscape structure in demonstrating the greater importance of the former. Future research should include systematic Barred Owl roadkill surveys that account for sampling biases in order to determine the importance of roads as a source of mortality for the species and to gain a better understanding of the effects of roadway design on the incidence of Barred Owl-vehicle collisions.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2015.0

Using propensity score matching methods, the current study analyzes data from the North Carolina Capital Sentencing Project to examine whether “sex matters” in capital sentencing. Findings demonstrated that prior to matching there was a significant difference in the likelihood of receiving the death penalty for female and male defendant cases; however, after matching cases on an array of legal and extralegal case characteristics, these differences were no longer significant. Further results revealed that male defendants’ cases included different aggravating and mitigating factors than female defendants’ cases and that female defendants had limited “paths” to capital trials. Findings suggest that any apparent sex effects that are observed in capital sentencing stem from real differences in the case characteristics found in female and male defendants’ cases rather than any direct effects of defendant sex on jury decision-making.

For example, short sleep durations and daytime sleepiness, an indicator of insufficient sleep and/or poor sleep quality, have been identified as risk factors for hypertension in the adult population. However, less evidence exists regarding whether these relationships hold within child and early adolescent samples and what factors mediate the relationship between sleep and risk for hypertension. Using data from the Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development, the present study examined body mass index (BMI) as a possible mediator for the effects of school-night sleep duration, weekend night sleep duration, and daytime sleepiness on risk for hypertension in a sample of sixth graders. The results demonstrated gender-specific patterns. Among boys, all three sleep characteristics predicted BMI and yielded significant indirect effects on risk for hypertension. Oppositely, only daytime sleepiness predicted BMI among girls and yielded a significant indirect effect on risk for hypertension. The findings provide clarification for the influence of sleep on the risk for hypertension during early adolescence and suggest a potential need for gender-specific designs in future research and application endeavors.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Psychology,2014.0

To promote this end, we examined three years of JBP author, manuscript, and reviewer data in the hopes of gleaning insights into potential drivers of manuscript quality and publication success for authorship teams. Although the great majority of research in the organizational sciences is conducted in teams (Acedo et al. 2006; Wuchty et al. 2007), an extensive literature review revealed scant empirical work investigating team factors related to manuscript quality.

When mental illness or reduced capacity is not enough to preclude death-eligibility, these factors are often discussed at the sentencing phase as mitigators. Mitigation remains an under-researched avenue in the sentencing literature, particularly when it comes to the influence of specific types of mitigation. The present study contributes to knowledge on mental health mitigation by examining five mitigators relevant to the mental health and capacity of defendants. Using data from 834 capital sentences in North Carolina, the influence of these proximate culpability mitigators on jury sentence recommendations is examined.

2-s2.0-84939898032,Article,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of adult attachment on perceptions of trustworthiness and trust in one’s supervisor. Specifically, we cast trustworthiness perceptions as the cognitive mechanisms by which attachment influences trust, which then influenced work outcomes. Design/methodology/approach: Data on attachment, trustworthiness, and trust were obtained from employees, and performance ratings were provided by the employees’ direct supervisor (n = 353, 157 supervisors). Findings: Secure and counterdependent attachment had a significant impact on trustworthiness perceptions, and secure attachment was also significantly related to trust, even in the presence of trustworthiness perceptions. Overdependent attachment had no significant influence on trustworthiness or trust perceptions. Implications: Adult attachment influences one’s regulatory processes in interpersonal relationships and will certainly influence trust in one’s supervisor. Understanding the process by which attachment influences trust in one’s supervisor via trustworthiness perceptions provides a more comprehensive picture of how trust develops. This study provides evidence that adult attachment influences trustworthiness and trust simultaneously, which may be helpful in the selection process but also in managing the interpersonal aspect of the employee–supervisor relationship. Originality/value: Though trust has been linked to attachment in the literature, no research has examined adult attachment and its influence on trustworthiness perceptions. Our paper provides an examination of attachment and its role in a comprehensive model of interpersonal trust. In addition, we examine attachments influence on trustworthiness and trust beyond the influence of propensity to trust, a commonly studied dispositional variable in the trust literature.",Business,Management,2015.0

Most species are well differentiated morphologically, and a previous morphological phylogeny recovered the genus as monophyletic. However, some of these species have overlapping geographical distributions and considerable intraspecific variation, perhaps representing a species complex. Mitochondrial (12S rRNA and COI) and nuclear (ITS2 and 28S) genes were sequenced from 132 specimens collected from 27 localities.

A phylogeographic study of the complex was conducted using mitochondrial haplotypes. This revealed remarkably poor dispersal among populations, with only one case of a shared haplotype, and very low genetic diversity. The phylogeny showed a clear break between populations on either side of a narrow region of forest, suggesting an important historical event separated these lineages in the genus.

Participants provided self-reported height and weight, which were used to calculate body mass index (BMI) and completed the Body Image-Acceptance and Action Questionnaire (BI-AAQ; Sandoz, Wilson, Merwin, & Kellum, 2013) as a measure of body image flexibility and the Body Appreciation Scale (BAS; Avalos, Tylka, & Wood-Barcalow, 2005). Body dissatisfaction was operationalized as three types of body size discrepancy scores (i.e., current minus personal ideal, current minus cultural ideal, current minus typical female ethnic peer) using Pulvers' Figure Rating Scale (Pulvers et al., 2004). In all models tested, body image flexibility partially mediated the associations between body dissatisfaction and body appreciation. Results were retained controlling for BMI.

Despite the fact that hundreds of sequences for this group are now publicly available, they constitute different sets of taxa and genetic markers. Integrating these data to construct a molecular phylogeny of the family is a significant bioinformatics challenge. We used sequences of eight markers obtained from freshly collected sand flies from Ethiopia and combined them with over 1300 publicly available sequences, performing a combined analysis after generating single terminal sequences from ancestral reconstructions for some individual markers. The resulting phylogeny had 113 terminals and recovered Phlebotominae and certain species groups as monopheletic. Although the 20 outgroups in Psychodinae were recovered as a well-resolved clade with bootstrap support for many internal clades, Phlebotominae was recovered as several lineages with unclear relationships among them. However, phlebotomines clustered by geographic region, the most notable being all the New World species except Brumptomyia (Galati), which were recovered as monophyletic. Our phylogeny suggests a Sub-Saharan African or South Asian origin for the subfamily, which subsequently expanded to the north and west, and eventually to the New World.

However, to perform a task, the motion of a continuum manipulator must not only avoid obstacles, i.e. subject to environment constraints, but also satisfy certain position and orientation constraints imposed by the task. An important open issue is how to enable a (mobile) continuum manipulator to perform a task-constrained motion while avoiding obstacles. In this paper, we introduce a general formulation of the problem and an approach to automatic planning of mobile continuum manipulation under general task and environmental constraints. The effectiveness of the approach is verified by simulation and real experiments.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2015.0

2-s2.0-84940704514,Article,"Introduction In 2003, Barbados, a developing country with universal health care, launched the Barbados Strategic Plan for Health, a national intervention to promote public health. Teachers, health educators, and clinicians worked to improve children's health, with particular focus on asthma and diabetes. We studied this intervention by using data on preventable hospitalization, an indicator that assesses both the overall effectiveness of public health and access to primary health care. The purpose of this study was to assess the Barbados Strategic Plan for Health by measuring rates of preventable hospitalization among children. Few researchers have studied these hospitalizations for children, and only 1 study has done so in a developing country. Methods We calculated annual (2003-2008) population-based rates of preventable hospitalizations from birth through age 19, both summary and disease-specific, for the 5 conditions that define the indicator for children: asthma, diabetes, gastroenteritis, urinary tract infection, and perforated appendix. Results Across the 6 years, the population rates of preventable hospitalizations increased 115.4% for boys and 67.2% for girls (both P < .001). Asthma accounted for much of the increase. Regression analysis indicated that the average annual increase in asthma hospitalization for boys was 0.45 per 1,000, an average annual increase of 20.6% of the baseline rate. These results suggest generally increasing rates of hospitalization for asthma for boys. There was no evidence of a corresponding rate trend for girls. Conclusion Results suggest an opportunity to improve public health education and access to primary health care. Public health professionals in developing countries can use the approaches of this study to evaluate initiatives to improve child health.",CHHS,Public Health,2015.0

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether maternal depression during pregnancy affected adverse birth outcomes, specifically preterm birth and small for gestational age (SGA). This study included 4123 women who participated in the 2009–2011 Utah Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System, an ongoing surveillance project that investigates maternal behaviors in women who have recently had a live birth. Women self-reported information on depression and outcome data were obtained from birth certificates. Logistic regression was used to obtain odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). Women who self-reported a diagnosis of depression during pregnancy had statistically significant increased odds of preterm birth as compared to women who had not been diagnosed with depression (OR 1.51; 95 % CI 1.07, 2.12); there was no association between depression and SGA (OR 0.92; 95 % CI 0.63, 1.34). After adjustment for prenatal care visits, the depression–preterm birth association was attenuated and no longer statistically significant (OR 1.29; 95 % CI 0.90, 1.85). After adjustment for smoking, there continued to be no strong association between depression and SGA (OR 0.80; 95 % CI 0.54, 1.20). The findings of this study do not support a maternal depression–adverse birth outcomes relationship among a predominantly healthy population of non-Hispanic White, well educated women.

As organizations, schools need teachers who are satisfied with their jobs and who work with one another to buildschool community and increase student achievement. School organizational culture shapesteacher job satisfaction in many ways, but it is still unclear which facets of organizationalculture have the greatest influence on teacher job satisfaction and whether some of these facetsmay have moderating effects on others. Purpose of Study: This study investigates the association among two aspects of organizationalculture (professional community and teacher collaboration), teacher control over schooland classroom policy, and teacher job satisfaction. We use the term Collective PedagogicalTeacher Culture to refer to those schools with strong norms of professional community andteacher collaboration. Research Design: We use a nationally representative sample of U.S. kindergarten teachersfrom the Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey in 1998-1999 and hierarchical linear modelingto examine the association between aspects of school organizational culture and teacherjob satisfaction. Findings: We find that professional community, collaboration, and teacher control are predictiveof satisfaction and they also have interactive influences. The association between teachercollaboration and job satisfaction, as well as that between control over classroom policy andjob satisfaction, is most pronounced in schools with weaker professional communities. Recommendations: Future reform efforts that foster greater professional communities, teachercollaboration, and control over classrooms can exist alongside more conventional reformssuch as raising curricular standards and instituting greater accountability.

2-s2.0-84940885533,Article,"Objectives: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), the most common hereditary kidney disorder, is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease. While there is no pharmacologic ADPKD therapy indicated, earlier supportive treatment may reduce disease burden, which may lead to the reduction or prevention of healthcare utilization and costs. To help US healthcare payers to understand this genetic disorder and the related healthcare utilization and costs, we performed a literature review on ADPKD. Study Design: This literature review includes information on ADPKD incidence and prevalence, diagnostic criteria and risk factors, and the humanistic and economic burden. The information was summarized to characterize the impact of ADPKD on patients and healthcare systems. Methods: PubMed and EMBASE databases from January 2003 to March 2013 were searched for articles containing relevant key terms, which were then screened for exclusion criteria to focus on data for ADPKD. For the selected publications, data were extracted and summarized. Results: The results indicate that prevalence studies are outdated and have generally been on small populations. Additionally, diagnostic criteria are established, and a few possible disease progression prognostic factors have been identified. Pain is a commonly recognized element of humanistic burden, and a correlation between reduced kidney function and increased healthcare costs has been demonstrated. Conclusions: ADPKD is a serious health condition. Additional studies are needed to evaluate the disease burden of ADPKD on patients, especially the effect of rapid progression on quality of life, and the actual costs associated with ADPKD.",CHHS,Public Health,2015.0

Limited research on HROs (e.g., military groups and firefighters) considers how normative demands on feeling and emotion help to explain why some events are recognised and responded to while others not. In this article, we propose a model of enactment of anomalous events (i.e., situation changing events) that considers the manner in which emotions are regulated in high reliability contexts and how this influences the extent to which early indicators of anomalous events are heeded or dismissed. In this article, we seek to provide a theoretical framework for explaining both the enabling mechanisms by which emotions may function as a signalling resource in the detection of anomalous events and the constraining mechanisms through when emotion regulation processes may inhibit reliability.

How does the use of precision weapons influence public support for the use of force? The public is averse to casualties, mission failure, and collateral damage. I argue that precision weapons increase the salience and importance of avoiding civilian harm. Individuals adopt their expectations about the outcomes of using these weapons and have lower tolerance for attacks that result in civilian deaths. This proposition is consistent with the results of two survey experiments. In the first, the possibility of civilian casualties leads to larger declines in support for the use of force than do military casualties or mission failure. In the second, respondents primed with information about an attack with precision weapons exhibited less tolerance for civilian harm than those primed with other weapons systems, despite the fact that the outcomes described to all respondents were identical.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Political Science and Public Administration,2015.0
2-s2.0-84941133892,Article,"An atlas-based IMRT planning technique for prostate cancer was developed and evaluated. A multi-dose atlas was built based on the anatomy patterns of the patients, more specifically, the percent distance to the prostate and the concaveness angle formed by the seminal vesicles relative to the anterior-posterior axis. A 70-case dataset was classified using a k-medoids clustering analysis to recognize anatomy pattern variations in the dataset. The best classification, defined by the number of classes or medoids, was determined by the largest value of the average silhouette width. Reference plans from each class formed a multi-dose atlas. The atlas-guided planning (AGP) technique started with matching the new case anatomy pattern to one of the reference cases in the atlas; then a deformable registration between the atlas and new case anatomies transferred the dose from the atlas to the new case to guide inverse planning with full automation. 20 additional clinical cases were re-planned to evaluate the AGP technique. Dosimetric properties between AGP and clinical plans were evaluated. The classification analysis determined that the 5-case atlas would best represent anatomy patterns for the patient cohort. AGP took approximately 1 min on average (corresponding to 70 iterations of optimization) for all cases. When dosimetric parameters were compared, the differences between AGP and clinical plans were less than 3.5%, albeit some statistical significances observed: homogeneity index (p > 0.05), conformity index (p < 0.01), bladder gEUD (p < 0.01), and rectum gEUD (p = 0.02).

In the current study, we examine 3 such issues related to the influence of weight-based stigmatization in retail settings. First, we highlight research on the impact of obesity in men often is minimized or altogether excluded, and we examine whether weight-based stigmatization influences men in authentic retail settings (Study 1). Across retail contexts, Study 1 reveals that heavy (vs. nonheavy) men do experience significantly more interpersonal (subtle) discrimination. Second, we examine the ""why"" of weight-based stigmatization and find that weight-related negative stereotypes compound to produce indirect but strong effects of stigmatization in retail settings (Study 2). Third and finally, we examine whether weight-based stigmatization against men and women in retail also influences ratings of associated products and the organizations for which heavy individuals work (also Study 2). Results from Study 2 show that stereotypes work similarly for men and women and that a stigma-by-association effect occurs in which evaluators rate products and organizations associated with heavy (vs. nonheavy) retail personnel more negatively. Finally, we discuss the importance of these findings in gaining a more holistic look at the influence of weight stigmatization in the workplace.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Psychology,2015.0

Methods: Women (N = 653) participating in a longitudinal observational study completed questionnaires within 8 months of breast cancer diagnosis and 6, 12, and 18 months later. Group-based modeling identified PTG trajectories. Chi-square tests and ANOVA detected group differences in demographic, medical, and psychosocial variables. Results: Six trajectory groups emerged. Three were stable at different levels of PTG, two increased modestly, and one increased substantially over time. Trajectory groups differed by age, race, receipt of chemotherapy, illness intrusiveness, depressive symptoms, active-adaptive coping, and social support.

Transnationalism refers to the delinking of the individual from his or her government and an increase in international ties as a result of the economic globalization that promotes the movement of people, goods, money, and ideas. Prevailing consensus is that the state, particularly in Latin America, is weakened by transnationalism because individuals are freer than ever from state control. This article argues that examining Latin American emigrant policies yields a different conclusion, namely that the state's response to transnational pressures has made governments more active and relevant in certain ways than in the past. Studies of transnationalism must therefore incorporate state strategies for a better understanding of its impact on Latin American governments.

Typically, researchers present three indices, r<inf>wg</inf>, ICC(1), and ICC(2), to demonstrate agreement and consistency among lower-level units when justifying aggregation. Nevertheless, researchers debate what values for these indices are sufficient. This study examines the distributional characteristics of ICCs and r<inf>wg</inf> values from three sources: the multilevel literature, a large multinational sample of student teams, and a large sample of randomly generated “pseudo teams.” Our results support existing cutoff criteria for ICCs but suggest that generally accepted values for r<inf>wg</inf> may, under certain circumstances, reflect pseudo-agreement (i.e., agreement observed among two raters not attributable to the same target). Thus, when there is minimal between-group variance (i.e., low ICCs), it is difficult to determine whether high r<inf>wg</inf> values reflect agreement or pseudo-agreement. Based on these findings, we provide recommendations to help researchers interpret aggregation indices.",Business,Management,2015.0

In contrast, very little is known about hemoglobins in echinoderms, a phylum of exclusively marine organisms closely related to vertebrates, beyond the presence of coelomic hemoglobins in sea cucumbers and brittle stars. We identified about 50 hemoglobins in sea urchin, starfish and sea cucumber genomes and transcriptomes, and used Bayesian inference to carry out a molecular phylogenetic analysis of their relationship to vertebrate sequences, specifically, to assess the hypothesis that the neuroglobin and cytoglobin lineages are also present in echinoderms. Results: The genome of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus encodes several hemoglobins, including a unique chimeric 14-domain globin, 2 androglobin isoforms and a unique single androglobin domain protein. Other strongylocentrotid genomes appear to have similar repertoires of globin genes. We carried out molecular phylogenetic analyses of 52 hemoglobins identified in sea urchin, brittle star and sea cucumber genomes and transcriptomes, using different multiple sequence alignment methods coupled with Bayesian and maximum likelihood approaches. The results demonstrate that there are two major globin lineages in echinoderms, which are related to the vertebrate neuroglobin and cytoglobin lineages. Furthermore, the brittle star and sea cucumber coelomic hemoglobins appear to have evolved independently from the cytoglobin lineage, similar to the evolution of erythroid oxygen binding globins in cyclostomes and vertebrates.

Notch and Wnt signaling are involved in various biological processes including orchestrating satellite cell activity within skeletal muscle. These pathways become dysfunctional during the aging process and may contribute to the poor skeletal muscle competency. Phytoecdysteroids are natural adapto-genic compounds with demonstrated benefit on skeletal muscle. AIM: To determine the extent to which a phy-toecdysteroid enriched extract from Ajuga turkestanica (ATE) affects Notch and Wnt signaling in aged skeletal muscle. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male C57BL/6 mice (20 months) were randomly assigned to Control (CT) or ATE treatment groups. Chow was supplemented with either vehicle (CT) or ATE (50 mg/kg/day) for 28 days. Following supplementation, the triceps brachii muscles were harvested and immunohistochemical analyses performed. Components of Notch or Wnt signaling were co-labelled with Pax7, a quiescent satellite cell marker. RESULTS: ATE supplementation significantly increased the percent of active Notch/Pax7+ nuclei (p = 0.005), Hes1/Pax7+ nuclei (p = 0.038), active B-catenin/Pax7+ nuclei (p = 0.011), and Lef1/Pax7+ nuclei (p = 0.022), compared to CT.

2-s2.0-84942308877,Article,"We compare carbonized seeds and charcoal excavated from four Bronze Age settlements in the eastern Mediterranean to infer distinctions in fuel use and the exploitation of woody vegetation amid developing anthropogenic landscapes. Charcoal evidence generally implicates combustion of fuel wood, while burned seeds commonly result from dung fuel use. Varying fuel consumption profiles reflect the availability of woody vegetation and cultivation practices that reveal temporal and geographical dynamics on Bronze Age agrarian landscapes. In the farmlands of the northern Jordan Valley, villagers at Early Bronze Tell Abu en-Nia'j and subsequently at Middle Bronze Tell el-Hayyat relied heavily on dung for their fuel needs, supplemented by burning of orchard prunings and to a lesser extent wood from nearby riparian vegetation. In this agrarian setting, limited availability of forest resources engendered exploitation of the highest diversities of cultivated crops, weedy species and woody plants. The village of Zahrat adh-Dhra'1 (contemporaneous with Tell el-Hayyat) on the arid, sparsely populated Dead Sea Plain relied less on dung fuel, and similarly harvested wood from orchards, while also utilizing the desert trees Acacia and Tamarix. Fuel use at Politiko-. Troullia, Cyprus suggests ready access to Pinus and Quercus forests, and burning of Olea wood from nearby orchards, associated with little dung fuel use and the lowest taxonomic diversity of fuel sources among these four Bronze Age communities. The range of evidence for fuel use at these settlements reflects varying exploitation strategies based on plant resources and animal management in agrarian countrysides, as well as the larger influences of urbanized or non-urbanized society during the development of Bronze Age anthropogenic landscapes.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Anthropology,2015.0

In this paper, we report on two field studies using an IDE tool in an advanced Web programming course. Our results indicate that the tool can increase students' awareness and knowledge of secure programming, but to be most effective, instructors may need to incentivize its use through in-class methods and careful timing of its introduction.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2015.0
2-s2.0-84942423204,Article,"Over the last two decades the translation profession has undergone a significant transformation that has led to increasing volume, often requiring a high level of subject matter expertise. As the demand for legal translation continues to grow, specialisation and task complexity are particularly relevant to translation professionals in the legal domain. Since many changes in the translation profession have occurred over a short span of time, the traditional curriculum needs to be adjusted so as to incorporate additional competences into the course content. This article proposes a graduate course on legal translation that is motivated by four main factors: (a) refining learning outcomes for the legal translation classroom since they differ significantly from general translation curriculum; (b) implementing a task-based methodology; (c) incorporating professional skills that are essential in the current industry; and (d) including a process and product-based approach for portfolio assessment. Furthermore, expert mentoring and a professional legal translation workshop are combined into the curriculum as key enhancements for the new course. The proposed learning outcomes for this course have been piloted with a graduate class at the University of Louisville, and the assessment of some of the learning outcomes is discussed. Preliminary data has been gathered from student portfolios and from a questionnaire completed by the students.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Languages and Culture Studies,2015.0

2-s2.0-84942474923,Conference Paper,"The basic principles of a flipped classroom teaching method are to deliver content outside of the class and to move active learning into the classroom. There are many strategies for delivering the content online, such as having instructors prepare online lectures, wrapping the course around a MOOC, and curating online videos from various sources. There are also many strategies for including active learning in the classroom that go beyond providing programming labs, and can include various forms of peer instruction. In this paper we describe our experiences flipping four different computer science classes across multiple semesters over two years. This breadth of experience with classroom flipping has enabled us to compare strategies and approaches and develop an understanding of which approaches appear to work under which circumstances. We discuss how we structured out-of-class preparatory work, how we created or sourced online videos, how we used active learning activities in-class to scaffold skills development and identify students' misconceptions, and how we structured teams for in class activities. This paper contributes a set of flexible strategies to consider for provision of curricular content out-of-class, structuring students' preparatory work, applying active learning of skills and concepts, and leveraging social interaction and peer instruction for CS education.

2-s2.0-84942475191,Article,"It is clear that IL-10 plays an essential role inmaintaining homeostasis in the gut in response to themicrobiome. However, it is unknown whether IL-10 also facilitates immune homeostasis at distal sites. To address this question, we asked whether splenic immune populations were altered in IL-10-deficient (Il10-/-) mice in which differences in animal husbandry history were associated with susceptibility to spontaneous enterocolitis that is microbiome dependent. The susceptible mice exhibited a significant increase in splenic macrophages, neutrophils, and marginal zone (MZ) B cells that was inhibited by IL-10 signaling in myeloid, but not B cells. The increase in macrophages was due to increased proliferation that correlated with a subsequent enhancement in MZ B cell differentiation. Cohousing and antibiotic treatment studies suggested that the alteration in immune homeostasis in the spleen was microbiome dependent. The 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that susceptible mice harbored a different microbiome with a significant increase in the abundance of the bacterial genus Helicobacter. The introduction of Helicobacter hepaticus to the gut of nonsusceptible mice was sufficient to drive macrophage expansion and MZ B cell development. Given that myeloid cells and MZ B cells are part of the first line of defense against blood-borne pathogens, their increase following a breach in the gut epithelial barrier would be protective. Thus, IL-10 is an essential gatekeeper that maintains immune homeostasis at distal sites that can become functionally imbalanced upon the introduction of specific pathogenic bacteria to the intestinal track.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2015.0

2-s2.0-84942603002,Article,"Background: Soybean (Glycine max) has been bred for thousands of years to produce seeds rich in protein for human and animal consumption, making them an appealing bioreactor for producing valuable recombinant proteins at high levels. However, the effects of expressing recombinant protein at high levels on bean physiology are not well understood. To address this, we investigated whether gene expression within transgenic soybean seed tissue is altered when large amounts of recombinant proteins are being produced and stored exclusively in the seeds. We used RNA-Seq to survey gene expression in three transgenic soybean lines expressing recombinant protein at levels representing up to 1.61 % of total protein in seed tissues. The three lines included: ST77, expressing human thyroglobulin protein (hTG), ST111, expressing human myelin basic protein (hMBP), and 764, expressing a mutant, nontoxic form of a staphylococcal subunit vaccine protein (mSEB). All lines selected for analysis were homozygous and contained a single copy of the transgene. Methods: Each transgenic soybean seed was screened for transgene presence and recombinant protein expression via PCR and western blotting. Whole seed mRNA was extracted and cDNA libraries constructed for Illumina sequencing. Following alignment to the soybean reference genome, differential gene expression analysis was conducted using edgeR and cufflinks. Functional analysis of differentially expressed genes was carried out using the gene ontology analysis tool AgriGO. Results: The transcriptomes of nine seeds from each transgenic line were sequenced and compared with wild type seeds. Native soybean gene expression was significantly altered in line 764 (mSEB) with more than 3000 genes being upregulated or downregulated. ST77 (hTG) and ST111 (hMBP) had significantly less differences with 52 and 307 differentially expressed genes respectively. Gene ontology enrichment analysis found that the upregulated genes in the 764 line were annotated with functions related to endopeptidase inhibitors and protein synthesis, but suppressed expression of genes annotated to the nuclear pore and to protein transport. No significant gene ontology terms were detected in ST77, and only a few genes involved in photosynthesis and thylakoid functions were downregulated in ST111. Despite these differences, transgenic plants and seeds appeared phenotypically similar to non-transgenic controls. There was no correlation between recombinant protein expression level and the quantity of differentially expressed genes detected. Conclusions: Measurable unscripted gene expression changes were detected in the seed transcriptomes of all three transgenic soybean lines analyzed, with line 764 being substantially altered. Differences detected at the transcript level may be due to T-DNA insert locations, random mutations following transformation or direct effects of the recombinant protein itself, or a combination of these. The physiological consequences of such changes remain unknown.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2015.0

This approach is salient in urban communities like Baltimore, Maryland, with one of the nation’s highest adolescent pregnancy and birth rates. Poverty, community violence, and compromised school systems further complicate the precursors and consequences of adolescent pregnancy. In this mixed methods study, we conducted interviews with key informants (n = 16) from community-based organizations, health departments, foundations, the public school system, clinics, and the faith community who worked with youth in Baltimore to gain a more comprehensive perspective on factors affecting adolescent pregnancy. Interviews were digitally recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using the constant comparative method. Geographic maps of select socio-demographic variables were created to examine the community context. Results highlighted contributing multi-level factors that emerged across the social-ecological model. Key informants described community- (e.g., environment, community norms, public policy; “Teen pregnancy is norm in many communities”), interpersonal- (e.g., peer social norms; “If you don’t perceive that you have a whole lot of options, you might just kind-of do what everybody else does”), and intrapersonal-level (e.g., specific developmental phase, self-esteem; “You need somebody to love and somebody to love you back”) influences on adolescent pregnancy and birth. GIS maps further illustrated disparities in adolescent birth rates, poverty level, and available community resources. Key informants recommended institutional and structural changes in the community, such as improving sexuality education and school-based health centers and increasing inter-organizational collaboration.

This case study prospectively examined the neuromuscular, biomechanical, and psychological consequences of a case of a medial ankle sprain. CASE DESCRIPTION: A recreationally active man with a history of a lateral ankle sprain (grade I) was participating in a university Institutional Review Board-approved research study examining the neuromuscular and mechanical characteristics associated with chronic ankle instability. Twentytwo days after the testing session, the participant sustained an eversion injury to his left ankle while playing basketball. OUTCOMES: The outcomes of this case are presented using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health model. Outcome variables were assessed at preinjury (medial ankle sprain), 3 months postinjury, and 5 months postinjury. Measurements included neural excitability of the soleus, balance assessment, joint stability, and psychological assessments. Data from this case study revealed that a medial ankle sprain reduces joint mobility and alters neural excitability of the soleus, with concurrent deficits in balance and self-reported function. These impairments forced the participant to downgrade his physical activity lifestyle up to 5 months postinjury. DISCUSSION: These data suggest the need for the development of intervention strategies to address impairments in neural excitability and joint mobility at the ankle to help patients meet the goal of maintaining long-term joint health.

However, to obtain a realistic mobility model in the dynamic urban environment is very challenging. Recently, several studies extract mobility models from large-scale real data sets (mostly taxi GPS data) without consideration of the statuses of taxi. In this paper, we discover two simple observations related to the taxi status via mining of real taxi traces: (1) the behavior of taxi will be influenced by the statuses, and (2) the macroscopic movement is related with different geographic features in corresponding status. Based on these two observations, a novel taxi mobility model (START) is proposed with respect to taxi status and geographic region.

Differences in the frequency of substance use are particularly likely to influence each friend’s perceptions of their relationship with the other. However, the impact of divergent substance use patterns within a friendship dyad on overall friendship quality remains an underexplored area. Self-reported alcohol use and perceptions of friendship quality data were collected from 2,154 students (mean age = 19.3) in 1,077 friendship dyads. Analyses of variance were conducted to determine (a) if friends who have similar alcohol use patterns perceive greater friendship quality than friends with dissimilar use patterns, and (b) how dissimilarities in drinking behaviors between friends affect individuals’ perceptions of friendship quality. Individuals in dyads comprised of friends with similar drinking patterns were found to experience higher quality relationships than those in friendships with dissimilar drinking patterns. Partners who drank less frequently in dissimilar friendships did not perceive the friendship to be of significantly lower quality than did their more frequently drinking peers. Interestingly, high-rate heavy episodic drinkers reported a significantly higher overall friendship quality when their peer was a low-rate heavy episodic drinker as opposed to a non-heavy episodic drinker. Since high-rate drinkers perceived higher friendship quality to low-frequency drinkers than non-heavy episodic drinkers, they likely place more value in the opinions of low-rate drinkers.

Two different perspectives, the supply and demand perspectives, can be adopted to examine this phenomenon. The former focuses on listing prices posted by sellers, and the latter uses transaction prices that consumers pay to obtain the product. However, no prior research has systematically compared both perspectives, and it is unclear whether different perspectives will generate different insights. Using a unique data set collected from an online market, we find that the dispersion of listing prices is three times higher than the dispersion of transaction prices. More interestingly, the drivers of price dispersion differ significantly between listing and transaction data. The dispersion of listing prices reflects sellers' perception of market environment and their pricing strategies, and it may not fully capture consumer behavior manifested through the variation of transaction prices.

We theorize that imported movies (mostly, American movies), which often have bigger budgets and superior moviemaking techniques, suffer from cultural discount in appealing to local (Korean) viewers. By contrast, homemade domestic (Korean) movies appeal to their own national market more effectively with customized cultural content (cultural categorization). Specifically, before movie release, imported movies tend to generate generally lower expectations because of local viewers’ cultural discount of those movies. Conversely, local domestic movies tend to generate generally higher but more polarized expectations arising from local viewers’ cultural categorization of the movies. These aspects lead domestic movies to perform better in theaters in the number of viewers and the movie’s life length. Imported movies, however, attain similar levels of viewer satisfaction because they have smaller and differentiated customer bases.

Mapping post-fire burn severity in a disease-affected forest often faces challenges because burned and infested trees may exhibit a high similarity in spectral reflectance. In this study, we combined (pre- and post-fire) Landsat imagery and (post-fire) high-spectral resolution airborne MASTER data [MODIS (moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer)/ASTER (advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer)] to map burn severity in a California coastal forest environment, where a non-native forest disease sudden oak death (SOD) was causing substantial tree mortality. Results showed that the use of Landsat plus MASTER bundle performed better than using the individual sensors in most of the evaluated forest strata from ground to canopy layers (i.e., substrate, shrubs, intermediate-sized trees, dominant trees and average), with the best model performance achieved at the dominant tree layer. The mid to thermal infrared spectral bands (3.0-12.5μm) from MASTER were found to augment Landsat's visible to shortwave infrared bands in burn severity assessment. We also found that infested and uninfested forests similarly experienced moderate to high degrees of burns where CBI (composite burn index) values were higher than 1. However, differences occurred in the regions with low burn severity (CBI values lower than 1), where uninfested stands revealed a much lower burn effect than that in infested stands, possibly due to their higher resilience to small fire disturbances as a result of higher leaf water content.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2015.0

To that end, North Carolina implemented a policy incorporating both local public health departments and other providers into medical homes for low income pregnant women and young children at risk of developmental delays. To understand how this transition occurred within local communities, a pre-post comparative case study was conducted. A total of 42 people in four local health departments across the state were interviewed immediately before the 2011 policy change and six months later: 32 professionals (24 twice) and 10 pregnant women receiving case management at the time of the policy implementation. We used constant comparative analysis of interview and supplemental data to identify three key consequences of the policy implementation. One, having medical homes increased the centrality of other providers relative to local health departments. Two, a shift from focusing on personal relationships toward medical efficiency diverged in some respects from both case managers' and mothers' goals. Three, health department staff re-interpreted state policies to fit their public health values. Using a political economy perspective, these changes are interpreted as reflecting shifts in public health's broader ideological environment. To a large extent, the state successfully induced more connection between health department-based case managers and external providers. However, limited provider engagement may constrain the implementation of the envisioned medical homes. The increased focus on medical risk may also undermine health departments' role in supporting health over time by attenuating staff relationships with mothers. This study helps clarify how state public health policy innovations unfold at local levels, and why front line practice may in some respects diverge from policy intent.",CHHS,Public Health,2015.0

2-s2.0-84944077219,Article,"Lightning is best known as a component of severe weather, but diverse communities of researchers, such as those in atmospheric chemistry and global fire modeling, have long recognized that lightning plays a significant role in many components of the Earth system. Global climate models are unlikely to be able to simulate lightning from first principles, but the same models do simulate many parameters related to convection, including total precipitation rate, convective precipitation rate, and convective mass flux. This study combines satellite observations of lightning and CMIP5 climate model simulations to derive an empirical parameterization of monthly lightning in terms of monthly simulated convective parameters. Convective mass flux best captures the spatiotemporal distribution of observed lightning. Derived lightning seasonality is captured with 95% confidence over 69% of land but only 30% of ocean. Spatially, the correlation of derived lightning and observed lightning is 0.74. Overall, global observations suggest lightning occurs at an annual rate of 47 flashes per second, while lightning from the parameterization occurs at 44 flashes per second. A robust feature of the relationship between lightning and climate model convective parameters is that lightning flash rate increases linearly with increases in convective precipitation rate and in convective mass flux for a significant subset of the total range of those convective parameters. Namely, this linear proportionality is evident when the convective precipitation rate is less than 4-5 mm day-1 and the convective mass flux is less than 15-16 kg m-2 h-1, which account for about 90% of the values simulated by the climate models.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2015.0

While there exist detailed models for individual types of infrastructures such as electric power grids, these do not encompass the various interconnections and interdependencies to other networks. Cascading effects are hard to discover and often the root causes of problems remain unclear. In order to enable real-time situational awareness for operational risk management one needs to be aware of the broader context of events. In this paper, we present a unique visual analytics control room system that integrates the separate visualizations of the different network infrastructures with social media analysis and mobile in-situ analysis to help to monitor the critical infrastructures, detecting cascading effects, performing root cause analyses, and managing the crisis response. Both the social media analysis and the mobile in-situ analysis are important components for an effective understanding of the crisis and an efficient crisis response. Our system provides a mechanism for conjoining the available information of different infrastructures and social media as well as mobile in-situ analysis in order to provide unified views and analytical tools for monitoring, planning, and decision support.

Though some become significant issues, most fail to become a substantial threat. The diversity and breadth of these potential problem substances has led policymakers, law enforcement officers, and healthcare providers alike to feel overwhelmed and underprepared for dealing with novel drugs. Objective: Inadequacies in training and preparation may be remedied by a response that is more selective and more proactive. The current manuscript seeks to clarify how to most efficiently forecast the ""success"" of each newly introduced novel psychoactive substance in order to allow for more efficient decision making and proactive resource allocation. Methods: A review of literature, published case reports, and legal studies was used to determine which factors were most closely linked to use of a novel drug spreading. Following the development of a forecasting framework, examples of its use are provided. Results: The resulting five-step forecast method relies on assessments of the availability of a potential user base, the costs-legal and otherwise-of the drug relative to existent analogues, the subjective experience, the substances dependence potential and that of any existent analogue, and ease of acquisition. These five factors should serve to forecast the prevalence of novel drug use, but reaction should be conditioned by the potential for harm. Conclusions: The five-step forecast method predicts that use of acetyl fentanyl, kratom, Leonotis leonurus, and e-cigarettes will grow, but that use of dragonfly and similar substances will not. While this forecasting approach should not be used as a replacement for monitoring, the use of the five-step method will allow policymakers, law enforcement and practitioners to quickly begin targeted evaluative, intervention, and treatment initiatives only for those drugs with predicted harm.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Criminal Justice and Criminology,2015.0

We also aim to establish the evaluation criteria and validation method to ensure an accurate and efficient learning process. A rapid learning approach is utilized to train the knowledge models in this study. 100 clinical cancer cases in the pelvic region were retrospectively analyzed. Among them, 40 cases are low-to-intermediate risk prostate cases (Type I), 20 are high-risk prostate cases with lymph node irradiation (Type II), 40 are anorectal cancer cases (Type III). Starting from a base model for type I cases, increasing number of cases with more complex planning-target-volume (PTV)-OAR anatomies (type II and type III) were continuously added into the training case pool. The studentized residual and the leverage values are calculated as evaluation criteria at each step. The efficiency and accuracy of the learning method was quantified by the learning curve. The gEUD in the bladder and rectum are compared between the model predictions and actual values for the validation cases. The Median of the Absolute value of their Differences (MAD) are calculated for the validation cases. The MAD of the predicted OAR gEUD in all three types of cases gradually decreases when increasing number of training cases are added in training. The knowledge models learned by this method reach comparable level of prediction accuracies as in batch training mode even less training cases.

Many existing approaches adopt several features to better characterize mammographic regions. However, most of them fuse features through feature concatenation or result-level combination, which cannot fully exert the discriminative power of different features and also sacrifices the overall computational efficiency. To address these drawbacks, we propose to utilize coupled multi-index for index-level feature fusion. Specifically, complementary local features are extracted from the same locations of mammographic regions. Then, they are separately quantized using the 'bag of words' (BoW) approach. Finally, quantized features are inserted into a two-dimensional inverted index, with each feature corresponding to one dimension. Experiments are carried out on a large dataset constructed from the digital database for screening mammography (DDSM). Results demonstrate that our approach not only achieves better retrieval precision and diagnostic accuracy than individual features do, but also improves the overall efficiency and scalability.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2015.0
2-s2.0-84944326807,Conference Paper,"We present an efficient knowledge based automatic beam configuration determination method by utilizing patient-specific anatomy and tumor geometry information and a beam bouquet atlas. The proposed technique is based on learning the relationship between patient anatomy and beam configurations from clinical plans designed by experienced planners. The training dataset contains 60 lung IMRT plans with plan prescription dose between 45 and 70 Gy. The method involves three major steps. First, a beam bouquet atlas was established by classifying the clinical plans into 6 beam configuration groups using the k-medoids cluster analysis method. Second, a beam efficiency map was constructed to characterize the geometry of the tumor relative to the lungs, the body and the other OARs at each candidate beam direction. Finally, the beam efficiency maps of the clinical cases and the cluster assignments of their beam bouquets were paired to train a Bayesian classification model. This classification model was used to select a suitable beam bouquet from the atlas for a new case based on its beam efficiency map. This technique was validated by leave-one-out cross validation with 16 cases randomly selected from the original dataset. The dosimetric parameters (mean±S.D. in percentage of prescription dose) in the auto-beam plans and in the clinical plans, respectively, and the p-values by a paired t-test (in parenthesis) are: lung mean dose (Dmean): 16.3±9.3, 18.6±7.4 (0.48), esophagus Dmean: 28.4±18, 30.7±19.3 (0.02), Heart Dmean: 21.5±17.5,21.1±17.2 (0.76), Spinal Cord D2%: 48±23, 51.2±21.8 (0.01), PTV dose homogeneity (D2%-D99%): 22±27.4, 20.4±12.8 (0.10). The other dosimetric parameters are not statistically different. In conclusion, plans generated by the automatic beam angle determination method can achieve dosimetric quality equivalent to that of clinical plans.

2-s2.0-84944328686,Conference Paper,"The purpose for this study is to develop robust and comprehensive knowledge models which can provide patient specific prediction of achievable dose distribution in radiation therapy plans for a wide range of cancer types. These models are useful tools to guide radiation therapy planning. Clinical RT plans for a number of cancer types including prostate, head and neck, anorectal, lung and spinal SBRT plans are studied retrospectively. The knowledge modeling correlates patient anatomical features with the dose features embedded in the RT plans. A number of patient’s anatomical and dosimetric features are considered in the model. The geometrical relationships between the OARs and PTV are represented by the distance-to-target histogram, DTH and the distance- to-OAR histogram. Important anatomical and dosimetric features were extracted from DTH and DVH by principal component analysis (PCA). For spine SBRT plans, voxel-level dose distribution is also predicted in addition to the dose-volume histogram (DVH) of spinal cord in order to explore the tradeoff between PTV coverage and spinal cord sparing by an active optical flow model (AOFM). A step-wise multiple regression method was used to select the most significant patient features which influence the dose distribution. To validate the knowledge models, the model predicted dosimetric parameters in the OARs of the validation cases are compared with the actual plan values. The difference between the model predictions and the actual values for some example dosimetric indexes are (mean±s.d.: volume in percent of OAR volume, dose in percent of prescription dose): lung V5Gy in lung IMRT plans: 0.1±6.9, Parotid median dose in head and neck IMRT plans: 0.9±5.6, Spinal cord D2% in spinal SBRT plans: 0.1±0.6.

Researchers from a wide range of disciplines thus examined issues related to women’s involvement in the workplace, including their work-family conflict. One emergent criticism of work-family research, however, is that extant research tends to emphasize work-family experiences of professional white women, while women of color are largely overlooked. Whereby some suggest that all women remain disadvantaged in the workplace (Hakim, 2004), women of color are often in “double jeopardy” for belonging to two disadvantaged status categories of gender and race (King, 1988).

These elevated parcels were drier (with less instability), and more negatively impacted by entrainment. Thus, as the updraft ingested a larger fraction of elevated parcels, its buoyancy was depleted, leading to demise. Unsurprisingly, the increasingly stable low-level environment played a dominant role in this process; however, wind profile modifications also elevated the mean source region of updraft parcels, which independently impacted storm strength and morphology. Changes to the storm's internal dynamical processes were assessed using the diagnostic pressure equation. The evolution in total vertical acceleration was primarily related to changes in accelerations that were connected to updraft rotation, as well as shifts in buoyancy. The dynamical accelerations weakened and became maximized at a different altitude, resulting in an increasingly elevated updraft parcel source region. Overall, this study finds that a shifting updraft parcel source region can significantly impact storm maintenance; importantly, such a shift can result from changes in environmental temperature, moisture, or wind profiles.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2015.0

Yet few if any design features that make CUREs effective have been identified. We developed a 17-item survey instrument, the Laboratory Course Assessment Survey (LCAS), that measures students’ perceptions of three design features of biology lab courses: 1) collaboration, 2) discovery and relevance, and 3) iteration. We assessed the psychometric properties of the LCAS using established methods for instrument design and validation. We also assessed the ability of the LCAS to differentiate between CUREs and traditional laboratory courses, and found that the discovery and relevance and iteration scales differentiated between these groups. Our results indicate that the LCAS is suited for characterizing and comparing undergraduate biology lab courses and should be useful for determining the relative importance of the three design features for achieving student outcomes.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Psychology,2015.0

QoL can be assessed subjectively, according to individual perceptions, and objectively, via secondary data sources. This paper is concerned with how well these two approaches may agree with one another, and in particular, enables the spatial mis-match between perceived satisfaction and objectively measured results to be identified. The case study of two fundamental QoL dimensions is examined in the city of Vienna, Austria: public transport and green space availability. Areas of general agreement discordance are mapped within a geographic information system and characteristics of residents living in places with a mis-match between satisfaction and GIS-derived measurements are assessed.

2-s2.0-84945484277,Article,"Spatial land-use models over large geographic areas and at fine spatial resolutions face the challenges of spatial heterogeneity, model predictability, data quality, and of the ensuing uncertainty. We propose an improved neural network model, ART-Probability-Map (ART-P-MAP), tailored to address these issues in the context of spatial modeling of land-use change. First, it adaptively forms its own network structure to account for spatial heterogeneity. Second, it explicitly infers posterior probabilities of land conversion that facilitates the quantification of prediction uncertainty. Extensive calibration under various test settings is conducted on the proposed model to optimize its utility in seeking useful information within a spatially heterogeneous environment. The calibration strategy involves building a bagging ensemble for training and stratified sampling with varying category proportions for experimentation. Through a temporal validation approach, we examine models' performance within a systematic assessment framework consisting of global metrics and cell-level uncertainty measurement. Compared with two baselines, ART-P-MAP achieves consistently good and stable performance across experiments and exhibits superior capability to handle the spatial heterogeneity and uncertainty involved in the land-use change problem. Finally, we conclude that, as a general probabilistic regression model, ART-P-MAP is applicable to a broad range of land-use change modeling approaches, which deserves future research.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2015.0

There is increasing interest in the inclusion of mangroves in national climate change mitigation and adaptation plans in developing nations as they become involved with incentive programs for climate change mitigation. The quality and precision of data required by these programs necessitates the use of an inventory approach that allows for quantification, rather than general characterization, of C stocks. In this study, we quantified the ecosystem C stock of the Zambezi River Delta mangroves utilizing a rigorous, yet operationally feasible approach. We applied a stratified random sampling inventory design, based on five forest canopy height classes, derived from Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite/Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (ICE Sat/GLAS) and the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data, and a Spatial Decision Support System to allocate inventory plots. Carbon content in above- and below-ground biomass pools in addition to soils to a depth of 200cm was measured. The average biomass C density for the height classes ranged from 99.2MgCha-1 to 341.3MgCha-1. Soil C density was the largest measured C pool, containing 274.6MgCha-1 to 314.1MgCha-1 and accounting for 45-73% of the height class ecosystem C densities, which ranged from 373.8MgCha-1 to 620.8MgCha-1.

Particularly, commuting trips from three typical residential communities to six main business zones are mapped and compared to analyze commuting patterns in Beijing. The identified commuting trips are validated by comparison with those from the survey in terms of commuting time and distance, and the positive validation results prove the applicability of our approach.

This paper proposes modeling structural systems as Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) for structural identification to solve for uncertain parameters in structural models. Consistent with measurement data, modal parameter estimates are treated as truncated both in terms of the number of modes measured and the number of measured degrees of freedom relative to the analytical model, which yields a challenging nonlinear inverse eigenvalue problem.

Existing approaches lack the capability to deal with multiple pose-related and -unrelated factors in a uniform way. Most of them can provide only one-dimensional yaw estimation and suffer from limited representation ability for out-of-sample testing inputs. These drawbacks lead to limited performance when extensive variations exist on faces in-the-wild. To address these problems, we propose a coarse-to-fine pose estimation framework, where the unit circle and 3-sphere are employed to model the manifold topology on the coarse and fine layer respectively. It can uniformly factorize multiple factors in an instance parametric subspace, where novel inputs can be synthesized under a generative framework. Moreover, our approach can effectively avoid the manifold degradation problem when 3D pose estimation is performed.

Neither p nor q is known a priori. Two scenarios respectively with s known and unknown are studied. Distribution-free tests are constructed based on the metric of the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD). It is shown that if the value of s is known, as n goes to infinity, the number m of samples in each sequence should be of order O(log n) or larger to guarantee that the constructed test is exponentially consistent. On the other hand, if the value of s is unknown, the number m of samples in each sequence should be of the order strictly greater than O(log n) to guarantee the constructed test is consistent.

WiTL was originally developed to address challenges in providing meaningful clinical experiences for interns during online summer coursework. In providing these experiences, a mentoring relationship emerged between the participating practicing and pre-service teachers. This chapter explores those relationships and how they were fostered by the unique features of WiTL, which include online threaded discussions, synchronous and asynchronous viewings of classroom instruction, and text chat communication. These relationships are further supported through WiTL's debriefing process, which allows for immediate interaction between pre-service and mentor teachers. The type of dialogue and collaboration encouraged by WiTL results in strong mentoring relationships. The potential for programs like WiTL to be implemented in PK-12 settings are discussed.",Education,"Middle, Secondary, and K-12 Education",2014.0

Land use practices of human decision-makers modify the landscape of the land system, possibly leading to landscape fragmentation, biodiversity loss, or environmental pollution—severe environmental or ecological impacts. While landscape-level ecological risk assessment supports the evaluation of these impacts, investigations on how these ecological risks induced by land use practices change over space and time in response to alternative policy intervention remain inadequate. In this article, we conducted spatially explicit landscape ecological risk analysis in Ezhou City, China. Our study area is a national ecologically representative region experiencing drastic land use and land cover change, and is regulated by multiple policies represented by farmland protection, ecological conservation, and urban development. We employed landscape metrics to consider the influence of potential landscape-level disturbance for the evaluation of landscape ecological risks.

Methods: Data stem from 3947 client encounters, provided by 223 case managers in 92 Medicaid-reimbursed prenatal case management programs; the clients were confirmed to be either adolescents (<20 years of age) or adults. Case managers provided information on each client encounter that occurred during 10 workdays over a 20 workday period using the Case Management Intervention Record, a data collection tool. The Chi square test and the Mann–Whitney U test were used to compare the types and number of problems, the types of intervention received, and the mean number of intervention minutes between adolescents and adults. Results: Adolescents experienced an average of 3.9 problems whereas adults experienced an average of 3.2 problems (p < 0.001). Compared to adults, adolescents were significantly more likely to experience problems in the areas of pregnancy health, family, education/job, transportation, and housing. With respect to breadth of interventions, adolescent clients were significantly more likely to receive support, clinical acts, and to be given tangible items compared to adult clients. On average, case managers spent significantly more time per encounter with adolescents than with adults overall (mean 56.6 vs. 50.3 min), and on educating, assessing, coaching, and monitoring.

In his classic CSA – FSA framework, Rugman suggests that successful multi-national enterprises (MNEs) are often built on the interaction between strong FSAs and strong CSAs at home. In the case of emerging market multi-nationals (EMNEs), he argued that strong CSAs were of particular importance in allowing EMNEs to develop FSAs. In particular, we examine CSAs at the sub-national level. Design/methodology/approach – The authors suggest that sub-national heterogeneity in market-supporting institutions is an important feature of emerging market economies, and that consideration of such heterogeneity contributes to our understanding of firm capabilities and overseas investment behavior of emerging market firms. The authors also identify explicitly the mechanisms through which sub-national institutions at home affect FSAs and, subsequently, the ability of emerging market firms’ entry into developed markets. Specifically, the authors argue that strong local institutions that support effective and well-functioning markets create the conditions that induce firms in that location to develop market-related capabilities in R&D and marketing, which, in turn, enable them to expand into developed countries. Findings – Using a unique data set on overseas investment by Chinese firms and causal mediation analysis, the authors find strong evidence in support of the view that strong sub-national institutions help emerging market firms develop the capabilities to enter developed country markets.

To understand the downstream effects of eQTLs on gene expression, we propose a network community approach to construct eQTL networks that integrates multiple data sources. By using this approach, we can view the genetic networks consisting of genes affected directly or indirectly by genetic variants. To extend the eQTL network, we use a proteinprotein interaction network as a base network and a spin glass community detection algorithm to find hubs of genes that are indirectly affected by eQTLs.

Subthemes of wisdom were more varied, reflecting the diversity of this construct in the context of nursing. Benevolence arose as a unifying theme between personal growth and wisdom, with subthemes centering on altruistic attitudes and behavior toward patients and the greater community.

In this project, we investigated the impact of symptom perception interventions on asthma trigger identification and self-reported asthma quality of life. Methods. Children with asthma (n=227) participated in three asthma education sessions and then were randomized first to one of three home monitoring conditions (symptom monitoring and peak flow training with feedback, peak flow training without feedback, or no peak flow training) and then subsequently to one of three resistive load discrimination training conditions (signal detection training with feedback, signal detection training without feedback, or no training). Triggers were reported at enrollment, following home monitoring, and following discrimination training; quality of life was measured after home monitoring and after resistive load testing. Results. Symptom perception interventions resulted in increases in reported triggers, which increased reliably as a function of home monitoring, and increased further in participants who completed discrimination training with feedback. Increases in the number of reported asthma triggers were associated with decreases in quality of life. Discussion. Patients may benefit from strategies that make trigger-symptom contingencies clear.

Consequently, implementing integrated water management (IWM) measures that reduce potable water consumption, stormwater runoff, and wastewater generation can potentially translate into significant energy savings. In this paper, the energy savings associated with IWM measures of rainwater harvesting and gray-water reuse are estimated, both at national and local utility scales using published data. At the national scale, it is estimated in this paper that up to 3.8 billion kWh and $270 million can potentially be saved annually by replacing landscape irrigation and other outdoor water uses through rainwater harvesting alone, and up to 14 billion kWh and $950 million in combination with gray-water reuse. Similarly, in Charlotte, North Carolina, the local water utility can potentially save up to 31 million kWh and $1.8 million annually. However, annual energy and associated cost savings per household are low at either scale, ranging between 1 and 120 kWh with associated cost savings of less than $10.

However, it remains unknown whether mindfulness meditation engages pain-relieving mechanisms other than those associated with the placebo effect (e.g., conditioning, psychosocial context, beliefs). To determine whether the analgesic mechanisms of mindfulness meditation are different from placebo,werandomly assigned 75 healthy, human volunteers to 4 d of the following: (1) mindfulness meditation, (2) placebo conditioning, (3) sham mindfulness meditation, or (4) book-listening control intervention. We assessed intervention efficacy using psychophysical evaluation of experimental pain and functional neuroimaging. Importantly, all cognitive manipulations (i.e., mindfulness meditation, placebo conditioning, sham mindfulness meditation) significantly attenuated pain intensity and unpleasantness ratings when compared to rest and the control condition (p=0.05). Mindfulness meditation reduced pain intensity (p=0.032) and pain unpleasantness (p<0.001) ratings more than placebo analgesia. Mindfulness meditation also reduced pain intensity (p=0.030) and pain unpleasantness (p=0.043) ratings more than sham mindfulness meditation. Mindfulness-meditation-related pain relief was associated with greater activation in brain regions associated with the cognitive modulation of pain, including the orbitofrontal, subgenual anterior cingulate, and anterior insular cortex. In contrast, placebo analgesia was associated with activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and deactivation of sensory processing regions (secondary somatosensory cortex). Sham mindfulness meditation-induced analgesia was not correlated with significant neural activity, but rather by greater reductions in respiration rate. This study is the first to demonstrate that mindfulness-related pain relief is mechanistically distinct from placebo analgesia.

People use fire to manage cropland and pasture in many parts of the world, impacting both the timing and amount of fire. So far, much previous research into how these land uses affect fire regimes has focused on either individual small regions or global patterns at annual or decadal scales. Moreover, because pasture is not mapped globally at high resolution, the amount of fire associated with pasture has never been quantified as it has for cropland. The work presented here resolves the effects of agriculture - including pasture - on fire on a monthly basis for regions across the world, using globally gridded data on fire activity and land use at 0.25° resolution. The first global estimate of pasture-associated fire reveals that it accounts for over 40 % of annual burned area. Cropland, generally assumed to reduce fire occurrence, is shown to enhance or suppress fire at different times of year within individual regions. These results bridge important gaps in the understanding of how agriculture and associated management practices influence vegetation fire, enabling the next generation of vegetation and Earth system models more realistically incorporate these anthropogenic effects.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2015.0

Obtaining and analyzing the contents of such datasets are both time and resource consuming. By summarizing the related work we demonstrate that researchers often focused on smaller subsets of the data, and seldom embrace the ''big-dataism''. With the emergence of cloud based computation systems such as Amazon EC2, one expects it to be easier to perform large scale analyses. However, our detailed time and cost analysis indicates that significant challenges still remain. Acquiring the open source data can be time intensive, and prone to being misinterpreted as Denial of Service attacks. Generating similarity scores for all prior reports, for example, is a polynomial time problem.

While systems and applications security policies define access control based on user identity or group, request type and the requested resource, network security policies uses flow information such as host and service addresses for source and destination to define access control. Therefore, both network and systems access control have to be configured consistently in order to enforce end-to-end security policies. Many previous research attempt to verify either side separately, but it does not provide a unified approach to automatically validate the logical consistency between both of them. In this paper, we introduce a cross-layer modeling and verification system that can analyze the configurations and policies across both application and network components as a single unit. It combines policies from different devices as firewalls, NAT, routers and IPSec gateways as well as basic RBAC-based policies of higher service layers. This allows analyzing, for example, firewall polices in the context of application access control and vice versa providing a true end-to-end configuration verification tool. Our model represents the system as a state machine where packet header, service request and location determine the state and transitions that conform with the configuration, device operations, and packet values are established.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of neuromuscular fatigue on quadriceps strength and activation and sagittal and frontal plane knee biomechanics during dynamic landing following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). BACKGROUND: Impaired quadriceps central activation occurs post-ACLR, likely altering lower extremity biomechanics. Neuromuscular fatigue similarly reduces volitional muscle activation and impairs neuromuscular control. Upon return to full activity post-ACLR, individuals likely concurrently experience quadriceps central activation deficits and neuromuscular fatigue, though the effects of fatigue on muscle strength and activation and biomechanics post-ACLR are unknown. METHODS: Seventeen individuals 7 to 10 months post-ACLR and 16 controls participated. Quadriceps strength and central activation ratio were recorded prefatigue and postfatigue, which was induced via sets of double-leg squats. Knee biomechanics were recorded during a dynamic landing activity prefatigue and postfatigue. RESULTS: Both groups demonstrated smaller knee flexion (initial contact, P = .017; peak, P = .004) and abduction (initial contact, P = .005; peak, P = .009) angles postfatigue. The ACLR group had smaller peak knee flexion angles (P<.001) prefatigue and postfatigue than controls. Knee flexion moment was smaller in those post- ACLR than controls prefatigue (P<.001), but not postfatigue (P = .103). Controls had smaller knee flexion moments postfatigue (P = .001). Knee abduction moment was smaller in both groups postfatigue (P = .003). All participants demonstrated significantly lower strength (P<.001) and activation (P = .003) postfatigue. CONCLUSION: Impaired strength, central activation, and biomechanics were present postfatigue in both groups, suggesting that neuromuscular fatigue may increase noncontact ACL injury risk. However, these changes were not exaggerated in those post-ACLR, likely because they already demonstrated a stiff-legged landing strategy prefatigue.",CHHS,Kinesiology,2015.0

In this paper, image- and feature-level schemes for privacy protection in fingerprint recognition systems are reviewed. Storing only key features of a biometric signature can reduce the likelihood of biometric data being used for unintended purposes. In biometric cryptosystems and biometric-based key release, the biometric component verifies the identity of the user, while the cryptographic key protects the communication channel. Transformation-based approaches only a transformed version of the original biometric signature is stored. Different applications can use different transforms. Matching is performed in the transformed domain which enable the preservation of low error rates. Since such templates do not reveal information about individuals, they are referred to as cancelable templates. A compromised template can be re-issued using a different transform. At image-level, de-identification schemes can remove identifiers disclosed for objectives unrelated to the original purpose, while permitting other authorized uses of personal information. Fingerprint images can be de-identified by, for example, mixing fingerprints or removing gender signature. In both cases, degradation of matching performance is minimized.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2015.0

This longitudinal, case-control investigation examined 20 patients scheduled for ACLr (11 females, 9 males; age: 20.9±4.4years; height:172.4±7.5cm; weight:76.2±11.8kg) and 20 healthy controls (11 females, 9 males; age:21.7±3.7 years; height: 173.7±9.9cm; weight: 76.1±19.7kg). Maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC), central activation ratio (CAR), normalized Hoffmann spinal reflexes, active motor threshold (AMT), and normalized motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes at 120% of AMT were measured in the quadriceps muscle at the specific time points. ACLr patients demonstrated bilateral reductions in spinal-reflexive excitability compared with controls before surgery (P=0.02) and 2 weeks post-surgery (P≤0.001). ACLr patients demonstrated higher AMT at 6 months post-surgery (P≤0.001) in both limbs. No MEP differences were detected. Quadriceps MVIC and CAR were lower in both limbs of the ACLr group before surgery and 6 months post-surgery (P≤0.05) compared with controls. Diminished excitability of spinal-reflexive and corticospinal pathways are present at different times following ACLr and occur in combination with clinical deficits in quadriceps strength and activation. Early rehabilitation strategies targeting spinal-reflexive excitability may help improve postoperative outcomes, while later-stage rehabilitation may benefit from therapeutic techniques aimed at improving corticospinal excitability.",CHHS,Kinesiology,2015.0

Male athletes (N = 20) cycled for 75 km while consuming water (WATER), bananas (BAN), or pears (PEAR) (0.6 g carbohydrate/kg each hour) in randomized order. UPLC-MS/MS and the library of purified standards maintained by Metabolon (Durham, NC) were used to analyze metabolite shifts in pre- and postexercise (0-h, 1.5-h, 21-h) blood samples. Performance times were 5.0% and 3.3% faster during BAN and PEAR versus WATER (P = 0.018 and P = 0.091, respectively), with reductions in cortisol, IL-10, and total leukocytes, and increases in blood glucose, insulin, and FRAP. Partial Least Square Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) showed a distinct separation between trials immediately (R2Y = 0.877, Q2Y = 0.457) and 1.5-h postexercise (R2Y = 0.773, Q2Y = 0.441). A total of 107 metabolites (primarily lipid-related) increased more than 2-fold during WATER, with a 48% and 52% reduction in magnitude during BAN and PEAR recovery (P &lt; 0.001). Increases in metabolites unique to BAN and PEAR included fructose and fruit constituents, and sulfated phenolics that were related to elevated FRAP.

2-s2.0-84949176237,"General Publications (Press, Editorials, Letters)","This chapter explores some of the issues that surround overstating, downplaying, or denying the occurrence of conquest warfare in the pre-Hispanic Andes. This form of conflict had great impact on the societies involved, and it is well known that Andean groups engaged in conquest warfare, particularly during the expansion of the Inca Empire. Reports of Inca conquest warfare were problematic from the beginning, with early written accounts enveloped in the debate about the legitimacy of Spanish imperialism in the Americas. In particular, the Spanish colonial administration benefited from overstating the scope and level of violence of Inca conquest warfare, utilizing such reports to help justify Spanish conquest and rule over the Andes. In terms of current archaeological reporting of pre-Hispanic conflict, various factors may cause researchers to downplay, if not ignore or deny the occurrence of conquest warfare. These include the difficulty of detecting the occurrence of warfare archaeologically, popular theoretical trends in the field, anti-war political sentiments, and the tendency of archaeologists to be partisans of the past inhabitants of the regions they study. But downplaying or ignoring the occurrence of conquest warfare can be problematic for two reasons. First, this may have a negative impact in terms of the objective to interpret accurately the archaeological record. Second, downplaying, ignoring, or denying conquest warfare can pose an ethical dilemma by conflicting with indigenous narratives of the past that link group identity to participation in past battles against or in league with the Incas.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Anthropology,2012.0

Most existing attempts to alleviate this problem resort to heuristic strategies to aggregate short texts into pseudo-documents before the application of standard topic modeling. Although such strategies cannot be well generalized to more general genres of short texts, the success has shed light on how to develop a generalized solution. In this paper, we present a novel model towards this goal by integrating topic modeling with short text aggregation during topic inference. The aggregation is founded on general topical affinity of texts rather than particular heuristics, making the model readily applicable to various short texts.

2-s2.0-84949779170,Conference Paper,"Social networks, due to their popularity, have been studied extensively these years. A rich body of these studies is related to influence maximization, which aims to select a set of seed nodes for maximizing the expected number of active nodes at the end of the process. However, the set of active nodes can not fully represent the true coverage of information propagation. A node may be informed of the information when any of its neighbours become active and try to activate it, though this node (namely informed node) is still inactive. Therefore, we need to consider both active nodes and informed nodes that are aware of the information when we study the coverage of information propagation in a network. Along this line, in this paper we propose a new problem called Information Coverage Maximization that aims to maximize the expected number of both active nodes and informed ones. After we prove that this problem is NP-hard and submodular in the independent cascade model, we design two algorithms to solve it. Extensive experiments on three real-world data sets demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithms.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2015.0

In this study, we consider environmental controls on microbial populations in coal-bearing strata of the Cherokee basin, an unconventional natural gas resource in southeast Kansas, USA. Pennsylvanian-age strata in the basin contain numerous thin (0.4-1.1 m) coalbeds with marginal thermal maturities (0.5-0.7% Ro) that are interbedded with shale and sandstone. We collected gas, water, and microbe samples from 16 commercial coalbed methane wells for geochemical and microbiological analysis. The water samples were Na-Cl type with total dissolved solids (TDS) content ranging from 34.9 to 91.3 g L-1. Gas dryness values [C1/(C2 + C3)] averaged 2640 and carbon and hydrogen isotope ratios of methane differed from those of carbon dioxide and water, respectively, by an average of 65 and 183%. These values are thought to be consistent with gas that formed primarily by hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. Results from cultivation assays and taxonomic analysis of 16S rRNA genes agree with the geochemical results. Cultivable methanogens were present in every sample tested, methanogen sequences dominate the archaeal community in each sample (avg 91%), and few archaeal sequences (avg 4.2%) were classified within Methanosarcinales, an order of methanogens known to contain methylotrophic methanogens. Although hydrogenotrophs appear dominant, geochemical and microbial analyses both indicate that the proportion of methane generated by acetoclastic methanogens increases with the solute content of formation water, a trend that is contrary to existing conceptual models. Consistent with this trend, beta diversity analyses show that archaeal diversity significantly correlates with formation water solute content. In contrast, bacterial diversity more strongly correlates with location than solute content, possibly as a result of spatial variation in the thermal maturity of the coalbeds.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Geography and Earth Sciences,2015.0

The way and the order of executing triggers causes new problems due to the commonness, differential benefit and applicability among sets of metaactions. Since the applicability of meta-actions should be judged by professionals in the field, our concentration is put on designing a strategy to hierarchically sort and arrange so called meta-nodes (used to represent action rules and their triggers in a tree structure) as well as to compute the effect of each meta-node.

With the expansion of Wuhan City, urban lakes became polluted, they shrunk or even disappeared, leading to unfavorable conditions for sustainable development of the city. To better understand the spatial relationship between the city and lakes, we classify the urban lakes in Wuhan central area into ′lakes in the urban center′ and ′lakes in urban fringe′.

We also use Geographic Information System (GIS) tool to calculate road density as a supplementary indicator to reflect the accessibility in proximity to urban lakes. The results indicate that relative independence exists between different towns, and the spatial characteristics are different depending on scales and locations. In most of cases, the road density is lower where closer to the lakeshore while the housing price exhibits an opposite pattern.

The purpose of this study is to examine racial and geographic variations in cataract surgery rates and determine the association between the racial composition of the community population and the racial disparity in the likelihood of receiving necessary cataract surgery. Methods: Using the national prevalence rates from the National Institute of Eye Health and the 2010 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project - Florida State Ambulatory Surgery Database, we determined the estimated cases of cataract and the actual number of cataract procedures performed, on four race/gender determined groups aged 65 and over in the state of Florida in 2010. The utilization rates and disparity ratios were also calculated for each Florida county. The counties were segmented into groups based on their racial composition. The association between racial composition and disparity ratios in receiving necessary cataract surgery was examined. The Geographic Information System was used to display countylevel geospatial relationships. Results: African-Americans have a lower gender-specific cataract prevalence (African-American male = 0.246, African-American female = 0.392, white male = 0.368, and white female = 0.457), but they are also less likely than whites to receive necessary cataract surgery (utilization rate: African-American male = 7.92%, African-American female = 6.17%, white male = 12.08%, and white female = 10.54%).

2-s2.0-84951838540,Article,"Background: If successfully implemented and enduring, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) stands to expand health insurance access in absolute terms, reduce inter-group disparities in that access, and reduce exposure to the financial vulnerabilities illness entails. Its durability - meaning both avoidance of outright retrenchment and fidelity to its policy aims - is thus of scholarly interest. Past literature suggests that social constructions of a policy's beneficiaries may impact durability. Questions: This paper first describes media portrayals of ACA beneficiaries with an eye toward answering three descriptive questions: (1) Do portrayals depict beneficiaries as economically heterogeneous? (2) Do portrayals focus attention on groups that have acquired new political relevance due to the ACA, such as young adults? (3) What themes that have served as messages about beneficiary ""deservingness"" in past social policy are most frequent in ACA beneficiary portrayals? The paper then assesses how the portrayal patterns that these questions uncover may work both for and against the ACA's durability, finding reasons for confidence as well as caution. Methods: Using manual and automated methods, this paper analyzes newspaper text from August 2013 through January 2014 to trace portrayals of two ACA ""target populations"" before and during the new law's first open-enrollment period: those newly eligible for Medicaid, and those eligible for subsidies to assist in the purchase of private health insurance under the ACA. This paper also studies newspaper text portrayals of two groups informally crafted by the ACA in this timeframe: those gaining health insurance and those losing it. Results: The text data uncover the following answers to the three descriptive questions for the timeframe studied: (1) Portrayals may underplay beneficiaries' economic heterogeneity. (2) Portrayals pay little attention to young adults. (3) Portrayals emphasize themes of workforce participation, economic self-sufficiency, and insider status. Health status, age, gender, and race/ethnicity appear to receive little attention. Implications and Conclusions: Existing literature suggests that these portrayal patterns may both support and limit ACA durability. In favor of durability is that ACA beneficiaries are depicted in terms that have been associated with deservingness in past American social policy - particularly being cast as workers and insiders. Yet, the results also give three reasons for caution. First, ACA insurance-losers are also portrayed as deserving. Second, it is unclear how the portrayal patterns found may impact the durability of the ACA's efforts to cut insurance disparities by age, health status, and especially race/ethnicity. Third, portrayals' strong casting of beneficiaries as workers, and limited attention to beneficiaries' economic heterogeneity and to young adults, may do little to help cultivate beneficiary political engagement around the ACA.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Political Science and Public Administration,2015.0

To facilitate this procedure, content-based image retrieval methods have been developed as case-based reasoning tools. Recently, with the rapid growth of histopathological images, hashing-based retrieval approaches are gaining popularity due to their exceptional scalability. In this paper, we exploit a joint kernel-based supervised hashing (JKSH) framework for fusion of complementary features. Specifically, hashing functions are designed based on linearly combined kernel functions associated with individual features, and supervised information is incorporated to bridge the semantic gap between low-level features and high-level diagnosis. An alternating optimization method is utilized to learn the kernel combination and hashing functions. The obtained hashing functions compress high-dimensional features into tens of binary bits, enabling fast retrieval from a large database. Our approach is extensively validated on thousands of breast-tissue histopathological images by distinguishing between actionable and benign cases.

Literacy also provides these students with skills to increase community participation, with independence, with skills to make individual choices, and with opportunities for potential employment. Portable technology such as an iPad2® can be used to enhance literacy skills for students with severe disabilities in elementary school. A typical way to teach literacy to this population is through the use of a shared story. Although systematic instruction has proven to be an effective teaching strategy, the generality of the literacy skills usually has not been the focus of the training. In this study, five students with severe disabilities (IQ below 55, range in age 7-11 years, grade range 2nd-6th grades) were taught to generalize literacy skills via multiple exemplar training. A multiple probe design across participants demonstrated a functional relation between student responding and the intervention.

This module is responsible for meta-actions discovery from a large collection of comments, written as text, collected from customers about their satisfaction with services provided by each client. Meta-actions, when executed, trigger action rules discovered from customers data which are in a table format. We specifically focus on the process of mining meta-actions, which consists of four representative and characteristic steps involving sentiment analysis and text summarization. Arranging these four steps in proposed order distinguishes our work from others and better serves our purpose.

STN is small, (9×7 × 4mm) and typically localized by a series of parallel microelectrodes. As those electrodes are in steps advanced towards and through the STN, they record the neurobiological activity of the surrounding tissues. By careful inspection and analysis of such recordings one can obtain a range of depth at which given electrodes passed through the STN. Both human made inspection and computer based analysis are performed during surgery in the environment of the operation theatre. There are several methods for the STN detection, one of them – developed by the authors – is described in [8]. While the detection of the STN interior can be obtained with good certainty its borders can be slightly fuzzy and sometimes it is difficult to classify whether given depth should be regarded as belonging to the STN proper or lying outside of it. Mapping of the borders is important as the tip of the final permanent stimulating electrode is often placed near the ventral (bottom) border of the STN [12]. In this paper we are showing that analysis focusing on narrow frequency bands can yield better discrimination of the STN borders and STN itself.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2015.0

This is accomplished based on a classical pixel non-uniformity (PNU) noise analysis of the iris sensor. For each iris sensor, a noise reference pattern is generated and subsequently correlated with noise residuals extracted from iris images. We conduct experiments using data from seven iris databases, viz., West Virginia University (WVU) non-ideal, WVU off-angle, Iris Challenge Evaluation (ICE) 1.0, CASIAv2-Device1, CASIAv2-Device2, CASIAv3 interval, and CASIAv3 lamp. Results indicate that iris sensor identification using PNU noise is very encouraging, with rank-1 identification rates ranging from 86%-99% for unit level testing (distinguishing sensors from the same vendor) and 81%-96% for the combination of brand (distinguishing sensors from different vendors) and unit level testing.

2-s2.0-84952037130,Conference Paper,"Traditionally, epidemiologists have counted cases and groups of symptoms. Modeling on these data consists of predicting expansion or contraction in the number of cases over time in epidemic curves or compartment models. Geography is considered a variable when these data are presented in choropleth maps. These approaches have significant drawbacks if the cases counted are not accurately diagnosed. For example, most regional public health authorities count influenza like illnesses (ILI). Cases of these diseases are designated as ILI if the patient exhibits fever, respiratory symptoms, and perhaps gastrointestinal symptoms. Several molecular epidemiological studies have shown that there are many pathogens that cause these symptoms and the relative proportions of these pathogens change over time and space. One way to bridge the gap between syndromic and genetic surveillance of infectious diseases is to compare signals of symptoms to pathogens recorded in molecular databases. We present a web-based workflow application that uses chief complaints found in the public Twitter feed as a syndromic surveillance tool and connects outbreak signals in these data to pathogens historically known to circulate in the same area. For the pathogen(s) of interest, we provide Genbank links to metadata and sequences in a workflow for phylogeographic analysis and visualization.

Not surprisingly, there are several conceptual models that attempt to explain how and why individuals use technology.

Our study takes an interactional psychology perspective, linking components of the FFM to the use of technology within the conceptual framework of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). After empirically confirming previous research findings linking performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and social influence to technology use, we test direct relationships between FFM personality traits and technology use in the context of a web-based classroom technological system, utilizing measures of perceived and actual use of technology. Consistent with expectations, conscientiousness and neuroticism are associated with perceived and actual use of technology, with conscientiousness demonstrating a positive association with both perceived and actual use and neuroticism, a negative association.

In this paper, we study a fault-tolerant topology design problem for an energy-harvesting heterogeneous WSN, where multiple supernodes with rich resources are used to improve the performance. We first model the network as a directed and weighted space-time graph in which both spacial and temporal information are preserved. We then define the fault-tolerant topology problem which aims to build a sparser time-varying structure from the original space-time graph while maintaining k-connectivity for the fault-tolerant purpose.

We identify a fourth source: perceived social mobility. We argue that when people perceive a reasonable chance for upward mobility based on personal initiatives and efforts, the status quo becomes more justifiable because individuals are responsible for their own successes and failures. Perceived social mobility thus instills a sense of optimism and fairness and exonerates the regime from many blames, thereby enhancing political trust. Regression analysis of the China portion of the 2007 World Values Survey data shows that respondents who saw themselves as having choices and control in life were indeed more likely to trust the ruling communist party.

It is naturally promising to investigate how to rank real estate from the viewpoint of diverse mixed land use, which can be reflected by the portfolio of community functions in the observed area. To that end, in this paper, we develop a geographical function ranking method, named FuncDivRank, by incorporating the functional diversity of communities into real estate appraisal. Specifically, we first design a geographic function learning model to jointly capture the correlations among estate neighborhoods, urban functions, temporal effects, and user mobility patterns. In this way we can learn latent community functions and the corresponding portfolios of estates from human mobility data and Point of Interest (POI) data. Then, we learn the estate ranking indicator by simultaneously maximizing ranking consistency and functional diversity, in a unified probabilistic optimization framework.

In the workplace, people meet to generate ideas, talk about problems, develop solutions, and make decisions (e.g., Romano and Nunamaker, 2001; Van Vree, 2011). What happens in workplace meetings has implications for individual employee attitudes such as work freagement, as well as for team and organizational performance (Allen and Rogelberg, 2013; Kauffeld and Lehmann-Willenbrock, 2012). Today, there are more than 25 million meetings per day in the United States alone (Newlund, 2012). On average, employees of today's organizations spend 6 hours per week sitting in meetings (e.g., Rogelberg, Leach, Warr, and Burnfield, 2006; Schell, 2010). The work lives of employees in managerial positions are even more driven by meetings. A study with senior managers showed that these managers were sitting in meetings for 23 hours a week on average and were expected to have even more meetings in the future (Rogelberg, Scott, and Kello, 2007). The majority of a manager's workday is often spent preparing for meetings, sitting in meetings, or processing meeting results (e.g., Van Vree, 2011). It is likely that most managers spend more of their time on meeting-related activities than on any other activity in their work lives. These figures illustrate a key point: Meetings are ubiquitous and time-intensive workplace events. Practitioners have long recognized this and have built entire consulting practices around organizational meetings. An Amazon search in July 2014 for advice books on how to run meetings yielded 475 hits on topics ranging from planning and leading freaging meetings (e.g., Harvard Business Review, 2014) to collaborating in meetings (e.g., Canfield and Smith, 2011) to when to abandon meetings altogether (e.g., Ressler and Thompson, 2008). Astonishingly, however, a scientific look at meetings as a focal topic remains largely elusive. Granted, research certainly exists that examines constructs/events relevant to meetings and meeting attendees. For example, a body of research on teams and leadership exists, and this literature is certainly highly relevant to meetings – but it does not feature the study of meetings per se. Given that meetings are essential feature of organizations, the development of a meeting science is of paramount importance.

When meetings have been studied, they have usually been analyzed as settings for the exploration of other phenomena.Recent research that examinesmeetings addresses a broad range of issues, but often leaves theoretical questions and assumptions regarding the nature of meeting communication itself and the role of meetings in shaping organizational life underspecified or completely unarticulated. What are meetings really? Why should practitioners and scholars see them as more significant than any other organizational phenomenon? Why should they believe that work meetings actually play an important role in shaping (i.e., rather than merely reflecting) larger attitudes and perceptions about organizations and the individuals who facilitate and participate in them? This chapter presents a set of metaphors that capture the various ways in which meetings are approached in contemporary research. Each metaphor reflects and sustains distinct assumptions about what meetings are, what role they play in organizational life, and the manner in which they constitute organizations. We argue that meeting science should deploy both practical and theoretical assumptions that position meetings as generative activities through which groups and organizations are constituted and sustained. The chapter also describes related directions for future research that would add to our understanding of the various ways that meeting communication shapes individual and organizational outcomes. Work meetings remain an enduring and frequently occurring activity in organizational life. Unfortunately, in spite of their prevalence, meetings have usually only been analyzed by scholars as settings for the exploration of other phenomena such as decision making or group development (Schwartzman, 1986). Consequently, the practical relevance and related frustrations of work meetings have received far more attention than theoretical questions about what meetings are and how they fit into larger organizational processes and outcomes.

Meanwhile, static configurations of networks and hosts simplify this adversarial reconnaissance. In this paper, we present a novel proactive-adaptive defense technique that turns end-hosts into untraceable moving targets, and establishes dynamics into static systems by monitoring the adversarial behavior and reconfiguring the addresses of network hosts adaptively. This adaptability is achieved by discovering hazardous network ranges and addresses and evacuating network hosts from them quickly. Our approach maximizes adaptability by (1) using fast and accurate hypothesis testing for characterization of adversarial behavior, and (2) achieving a very fast IP randomization (i.e., update) rate through separating randomization from end-hosts and managing it via network appliances. The architecture and protocols of our approach can be transparently deployed on legacy networks, as well as software-defined networks.

2-s2.0-84954461221,Article,"Smart grid deployment initiatives have been witnessed in recent years. Smart grids provide bidirectional communication between meters and head-end systems through Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI). Recent studies highlight the threats targeting AMI. Despite the need for tailored Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) for smart grids, very limited progress has been made in this area. Unlike traditional networks, smart grids have their own unique challenges, such as limited computational power devices and potentially high deployment cost, that restrict the deployment options of intrusion detectors. We show that smart grids exhibit deterministic and predictable behavior that can be accurately modeled to detect intrusion. However, it can also be leveraged by the attackers to launch evasion attacks. To this end, in this article, we present a robust mutation-based intrusion detection system that makes the behavior unpredictable for the attacker while keeping it deterministic for the system. We model the AMI behavior using event logs collected at smart collectors, which in turn can be verified using the invariant specifications generated from the AMI behavior and mutable configuration. Event logs are modeled using fourth-order Markov chain and specifications are written in Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). To counter evasion and mimicry attacks, we propose a configuration randomization module. The approach provides robustness against evasion and mimicry attacks; however, we discuss that it still can be evaded to a certain extent.

They discuss how they challenged themselves and traditional assumptions of our society to develop their own multicultural skill sets. It may have been one situation or a combination of situations; but for each author, there was a significant event that impacted him/her forever. In most cases, there were a number of factors and experiences that led the author down this very important path. White voices do matter and this book is a powerful collection of such voices in print. Individuals can be different and these chapters provide real stories and real situations where the authors made a conscious decision to not go with the “norm” and redirect their thoughts and actions to develop into proponents of multiculturalism. Through their actions, they have shown others that this behavior is acceptable, and in fact, is what everyone should be doing regardless of how they look, where they were born, or what neighborhood they currently live in. These stories open our eyes to what can really happen if we work at it. If not, we will be headed down a path of moral and social destruction where individuals who are different will never be accepted and will always feel inferior.

Using large datasets on Pheidole geographical distributions and phylogeny, we (1) inferred patterns of biogeographical modularity (clusters of areas with similar faunal composition), (2) tested whether species in open habitats are more likely to be expanding their range beyond module boundaries, and (3) tested whether there is a bias of lineage flow from high- to low-diversity areas. Location: The Old World. Methods: We compiled and jointly analysed a comprehensive database of Pheidole geographical distributions, the ecological affinities of different species, and a multilocus phylogeny of the Old World radiation. We used network modularity methods to infer biogeographical structure in the genus and comparative methods to evaluate the hypotheses. Results: The network analysis identified eight biogeographical modules, and a suite of species with anomalous ranges that are statistically more likely to occur in open habitat, supporting the hypothesis that open habitats promote range expansion. Phylogenetic analysis shows evidence for a cascade pattern of colonization from Asia to New Guinea to the Pacific, but no 'upstream' colonization in the reverse direction. Main conclusions: The distributions of Pheidole lineages in the Old World are highly modular, with modules generally corresponding to biogeographical regions inferred in other groups of organisms. However, some lineages have expanded their ranges across module boundaries, and these species are more likely to be adapted to open habitats rather than interior forest. In addition, there is a cascade pattern of dispersal from higher to lower diversity areas during these range expansions.

2-s2.0-84955314486,Conference Paper,"Segmenting structure-of-interest is a fundamental problem in medical image analysis. Numerous automatic segmentation algorithms have been extensively studied for the task. However, misleading image information and the complex organ structures with high curvature boundaries may cause under- or over-segmentation for the deformable models. Learning based approaches can alleviate this issue, while they usually require a large number of representative training samples for each use case, which may not be available in practice. On the other hand, manually correcting segmentation errors produces good results and doctors would like such tools to improve accuracy in local areas. Therefore, we propose a 3D editing framework to interactively and efficiently refine the segmentation results, by editing the mesh directly. Specifically, the shape editing framework is modeled by integrating the Laplacian coordinates, image context information and user specified control points. We employ a local patch based optimization to enhance the supplement force field near the control points to improve correction accuracy. Our method requires few (and intuitive) user inputs, and the experimental results show competitive performance of our interactive refinement compared to other state-of-the-art methods.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2015.0

Recently, the consideration of social characteristics of mobile nodes provides a new angle of view in the design of opportunistic routing protocols. In many opportunistic networks, a multitude of mobile devices are used and carried by people, whose behaviors are better described by social models. This opens the new possibilities of social-based routing, in which the knowledge of social characteristics of mobile users is used for making better opportunistic forwarding decision.

For example, there have been numerous outbreaks of H7 in the Americas and Europe since 1996. More recently, a reassortant H7N9 has emerged among humans and birds during 2013-2014 in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. This H7N9 genome consists of genetic segments that assort with H7 and H9 viruses previously circulating in chickens and wild birds in China and ducks in Korea. Epidemic risk modellers have used agricultural, climatic and demographic data to predict that the virus will spread to northern Vietnam via poultry. To shed light on the traffic of H7 viruses in general, we examine genetic segments of influenza that have assorted with many strains of H7 viruses dating back to 1902. We focus on use cases from the United States, Italy and China. We apply a novel metric, betweenness, an associated phylogenetic visualization technique, transmission networks, and compare these with another technique, route mapping. In contrast to traditional views, our results illustrate that segments that assort with H7 viruses are spread frequently between the Americas and Eurasia. In summary, genetic segments that historically assort with H7 influenza viruses have been spread from China to: Australia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Egypt, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Mongolia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, the UK, the US, and Vietnam.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2015.0

In animals, alternative splicing of mRNA isoforms between cell types is widespread and supports cellular differentiation. In plants, at least 20% ofmulti-exon genes are alternatively spliced, but the extent and significance of tissue-specific splicing is less well understood, partly because it is difficult to isolate cells of a single type. Pollen is a useful model system to study tissue-specific splicing in higher plants because pollen grains contain only two cell types and can be collected in large amounts without damaging cells. Previously, we identified pollen-specific splicing patterns by comparing RNA-Seq data from Arabidopsis pollen and leaves. Here, we used semi-quantitative PCR to validate pollen-specific splicing patterns among genes where RNA-Seq data analysis indicated splicing was most different between pollen and leaves. PCR testing confirmed eight of nine alternative splicing patterns, and results from the ninth were inconclusive. In four genes, alternative transcriptional start sites coincided with alternative splicing.

Stable water isotopes were applied to understand processes occurring within SCMs and their effects on water sourcing in urban streams. We sampled ten events from June to November 2013 at four locations along a 360-m headwater stream reach in North Carolina and at four SCMs (two ponds, one wetland and one bioretention) that contribute to the reach. We used streamflow upstream of the SCM-affected reach and outflow from an intensively sampled retention pond as endmembers to quantify contributions of this pond's outflow to streamflow. Synchronous sampling revealed that SCM outflows have different isotopic signatures, likely a function of evaporation and mixing within the storage volume of each SCM. The SCMs also have distinctive isotopic signatures relative to the receiving stream. The isotopic signature of discharge from the intensively sampled pond reveals varying residence times (hours to weeks) within the structure. At sampled timepoints during ten events, this pond, which drains 25% of the watershed's impervious area, contributed an average of 10% (0-21%) of the streamflow on the rising limb and 12% (0-19%) of discharge at peak flow. During recession, this pond contributed an average of 32% (11-54%) of the stream's discharge, reflecting the SCM's design goals of temporarily storing and delaying run-off, mitigating the effects of impervious surface on peak flows.

2-s2.0-84956661104,Article,"Purpose - The race concordance hypothesis suggests that matching patients and health providers on the basis of race improves communication and patients' perceptions of health care, and by extension, encourages patients to seek and utilize health care, which may reduce health disparities. However, relatively few studies have examined the impact of race concordance on the utilization of health services. This chapter is grounded on Andersen's Emerging Model of Health Services Utilization (Phase 4) and extends that model to include race concordance. Methodology/approach - The data were collected from a stratified random sample of adult beneficiaries enrolled in North Carolina Medicaid's primary care case management delivery system in 2006- 2007. Propensity score matching techniques were used to sort respondents on their propensity for race concordance and indices were constructed to generate key control variables. Poisson regression was used to examine the impact of race concordance on the utilization of primary care and emergency room care, under the assumption that race concordance would increase the use of primary care and decrease the use of emergency care for minority patients. Findings -While blacks (compared to whites) used less primary care and had more emergency care visits, race concordance was not a statistically significant predictor of either primary care or emergency room use. However, patients' satisfaction with their primary care providers was associated with significantly fewer primary care and emergency care visits while trust in one's provider was associated with more primary care visits. Research implications - The study findings suggest that the central premises of the race concordance hypothesis require further study to confirm the assumption that better patient - primary care provider relationships result in less utilization of more costly and resource-intensive forms of health care. Value of chapter - The study makes a valuable contribution by expanding the relatively small body of literature dedicated to exploring the impact of race concordance on health services utilization.

Results of these analyses have diverged considerably depending on the method used to assess accessibility. In this article, we revisit an increasingly popular technique, the two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method, and modify it to better align with the ways in which parks are planned and intended to be used. In this respect, we develop a Variable-width Floating Catchment Area (VFCA) method that models park attractiveness as a function of its size and number of amenities. We further compare accessibility according to four modes of transportation: bicycling, driving, public transit, and walking. A case study on access to public parks in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, the U.S. is performed. In general, walking access to parks is found to be low throughout the county, access to larger regional parks is greatest for outlying suburban areas, and center city residents have access to a greater number of park amenities. Study results are compared to those obtained when using the original 2SFCA and indicate important differences in spatial accessibility patterns. Consequently, caution must be adopted when choosing a spatial access model and interpreting the resulting spatial patterns of accessibility. The parameters of the VFCA can easily be set to different values, making it a tool for scenario analyses.

To deploy an RBAC system, one needs to first identify a complete set of roles, including permission role assignments and role user assignments. This process, known as role engineering, has been identified as one of the costliest tasks in migrating to RBAC. Since many organizations already have some form of user permission assignments defined, it makes sense to identify roles from this existing information. This process, known as role mining, has gained significant interest in recent years and numerous role mining techniques have been developed that take into account the characteristics of the core RBAC model, as well as its various extended features and each is based on a specific optimization metric. In this paper, we propose a generic approach which transforms the role mining problem into a constraint satisfaction problem. The transformation allows us to discover the optimal RBAC state based on customized optimization metrics. We also extend the RBAC model to include more context-aware and application specific constraints. These extensions broaden the applicability of the model beyond the classic role mining to include features such as permission usage, hierarchical role mining, hybrid role engineering approaches, and temporal RBAC models.

However, potential ubicomp applications require these sensors to perform an analysis in less controlled environments, particularly at a distance. In this paper, we discuss our design of uSmell—a gas sensor system for sensing smell in ubicomp environments—and an evaluation of its basic efficacy, effects of airflow and distance on classification accuracy, and in an example application. Our system samples an odor fingerprint from eight metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) gas sensors every second. It then processes the time series data to extract three features that highlight how time and distance affect the eight MOS gas sensors’ ability to react to the gas molecules released by an odor every 5 s; this generates 24 features in total that are then used to train a decision tree classifier. Using this approach, our system can classify a set of odors with 88 % accuracy when placed both in a small container with the samples and in open air 0.5–2 m from the odor samples. We also demonstrate its ability to classify odors in less controlled environments that might be targets for ubicomp applications by deploying it in a bathroom for a week.

They are important activators of mutable collagenous tissue (MCT), which have been extensively studied in echinoderms, and the four TIMP copies in humans have been studied for their role in cancer. To understand the evolution of TIMPs, we combined 405 TIMPs from an echinoderm transcriptome dataset built from 41 specimens representing all five classes of echinoderms with variants from protostomes and chordates. We used multiple sequence alignment with various stringencies of alignment quality to cull highly divergent sequences and then conducted phylogenetic analyses using both nucleotide and amino acid sequences. Phylogenetic hypotheses consistently recovered TIMPs as diversifying in the ancestral deuterostome and these early lineages continuing to diversify in echinoderms. The four vertebrate TIMPs diversified from a single copy in the ancestral chordate, all other copies being lost. Consistent with greater MCT needs owing to body wall liquefaction, evisceration, autotomy and reproduction by fission, holothuroids had significantly more TIMPs and higher read depths per contig. Ten cysteine residues, an HPQ binding site and several other residues were conserved in at least 70% of all TIMPs.

It is an ownership interest in a partnership that has no liquidation value at grant, but entitles the holder to a share in future partnership profits, if any. The term ""carried interest"" hails from the fact that the ""carried interest"" holder typically does not invest any of the holder's own capital in the partnership. Thus, the ""carried interest"" holder is ""carried"" by those who do invest capital in the partnership. Currently, the income that a ""carried interest"" receives is generally taxed as capital gain. Many commentators believe that income allocated by a partnership to ""carried interest"" holders should be taxed as compensation because the income is for the services the partner performs for the partnership. This paper will examine what the proper tax treatment of ""carried interests"" should be based on what is the most economically equitable, fair, and efficient method of taxation. Based on the equity and efficiency concepts, the authors suggest that a portion of all ""carried interest"" income should be taxed as a payment in exchange for services (i.e., as compensation)- regardless of the nature of the underlying assets inside the partnership and regardless of the nature of the business the partnership conducts.

Influential users, known as ""power users"" are able to exert substantial influence over recommendations made to other users, and RS operators encourage the existence of power user communities to help fellow users make informed purchase decisions. However, the influence power users wield can be used for both positive (addressing the ""new item"" problem) or negative (attack) purposes. Attacks on RSs tend to bias recommendations by introducing fake reviews or ratings and remain a key problem area for system operators. In prior work, we have shown that attackers emulating power users are effective against user-based, item-based, and SVD-based CF RSs. Previous research has shown that, in general, attacks on RSs can be mitigated by detecting the attackers and either removing them from the dataset or ignoring them during the prediction calculations. In live RS environments, however, these approaches impact legitimate users detected as attackers (false positives) and can lead to reduced coverage for those legitimate power users as well as reduced accuracy for other users that depend on the ratings of those legitimate power users. Our research is investigating alternative mitigation approaches to address these issues for power user attacks. We focus on techniques that remove or reduce the influence of power users and determine their impact on RS accuracy and robustness using established metrics.We introduce a new metric used to assess the trade-off between accuracy and robustness when our mitigation approaches are applied.

Thus, many algorithms have been developed for this task. Among them, nearest neighbor classification (particularly 1-NN) combined with Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) achieves the state of the art performance. However, when data set grows larger, the time consumption of 1-NN with DTW grows linearly. Compared to 1-NN with DTW, the traditional feature-based classification methods are usually more efficient but less effective since their performance is usually dependent on the quality of hand-crafted features. To that end, in this paper, we explore the feature learning techniques to improve the performance of traditional feature-based approaches. Specifically, we propose a novel deep learning framework for multivariate time series classification. We conduct two groups of experiments on real-world data sets from different application domains.

Engineering resilient system/infrastructure is a challenging task, that implies how to measure the resilience and how to obtain sufficient resilience necessary to maintain its service delivery under diverse situations. This paper has two fold objective, the first is to propose a formal approach to measure cyber resilience from different aspects (i.e., attacks, failures) and at different levels (i.e., pro-active, resistive and reactive). To achieve the first objective, we propose a formal framework named as: Cyber Resilience Engineering Framework (CREF). The second objective is to build a resilient system by construction. The idea is to build a formal model of a cyber system, which is initially not resilient with respect to attacks.

2-s2.0-84958810716,Article,"Network reconnaissance of addresses and ports is prerequisite to a vast majority of cyber attacks. Meanwhile, the static address configuration of networks and hosts simplifies adversarial reconnaissance for target discovery. Although the randomization of host addresses has been suggested as a proactive disruption mechanism against such reconnaissance, the proposed approaches do not exploit the full potentials of address randomization in provision of unpredictability and attack adaptability. Moreover, these approaches do not provide thorough analysis on effectiveness and limitations of address randomization against relevant threat models, including stealthy scanning and worms. In this paper, we present an effective address randomization technique, called random host address mutation (RHM), that turns end-hosts into untraceable moving targets. This technique achieves maximum efficacy by allowing address randomization to be highly unpredictable and fast, and adaptive to adversarial behavior, while incurring low operational and reconfiguration overhead. Our approach achieves the following objectives: 1) it achieves high uncertainty in adversary scanning by modeling address mutation randomization as a multi-level satisfiability problem; 2) it adapts the mutation scheme by fast characterization of adversarial reconnaissance patterns; 3) it achieves high mutation rate by separating mutation from end-hosts and managing it via network appliances; and 4) it preserves network integrity, manageability and performance by bounding the size of routing tables, preserving end-to-end reachability, and efficient handling of reconfiguration updates. Our extensive analyses and simulation show that the RHM distorts adversarial reconnaissance, slows down (deters) the attack, and increases its detectability. Consequently, the RHM is effective in countering a significant number of sophisticated threat models, including reconnaissance, stealthy/evasive scanning methods, and targeted attacks.

In response, this chapter explores the gender divide in secondary teachers' perceptions of effective technology integration. Using a qualitative research design, this chapter provides insight into social studies teachers' perceptions of their pedagogical practices and technology integration. The purpose of this study is to develop an understanding of the differences in male and female teachers' use of technology to teach and support student learning. Consideration of how technology is associated with gender-sensitive pedagogical thinking and practice may address the aforementioned gap in technology usage in social studies. Patterns uncovered in data analysis suggest that gender plays a critical role in social studies technology integration. The results from this study can inform methods in which technology is integrated into future social studies classrooms, particularly in emerging areas such as online courses.",Education,"Middle, Secondary, and K-12 Education",2015.0

Deficits in muscle function (i.e., strength and power) may contribute to abnormal knee joint loading. The associations between quadriceps strength, power and knee joint mechanics remain unclear in knee osteoarthritis. Methods Three-dimensional motion analysis was used to collect peak knee joint angles and moments during the first 50% of stance phase of gait in 33 participants with knee osteoarthritis. Quadriceps strength and power were assessed using a knee extension machine. Strength was quantified as the one repetition maximum. Power was quantified as the peak power produced at 40-90% of the one repetition maximum. Findings Quadriceps strength accounted for 15% of the variance in peak knee flexion angle (P = 0.016). Quadriceps power accounted for 20-29% of the variance in peak knee flexion angle (P < 0.05). Quadriceps power at 90% of one repetition maximum accounted for 9% of the variance in peak knee adduction moment (P = 0.05). Interpretation These data suggest that quadriceps power explains more variance in knee flexion angle and knee adduction moment during gait in knee osteoarthritis than quadriceps strength. Additionally, quadriceps power at multiple loads is associated with knee joint mechanics and therefore should be assessed at a variety of loads. Taken together, these results indicate that quadriceps power may be a potential target for interventions aimed at changing knee joint mechanics in knee osteoarthritis.",CHHS,Kinesiology,2015.0

Flipped classrooms can provide social interaction through approaches such as lightweight teams [23], where students collaborate during class in low-stakes peer learning. These teams scaffold positive interdependence [17] by removing high-stakes assignments that heavily impact student's grades. Given the proliferation of online courses, and MOOCs in particular, it is important to consider whether successful face-to-face pedagogical strategies can be reappropriated for distributed, online contexts. Specifically, we are interested in whether a low-stakes model could provide similar learning benefits when team members collaborate remotely. This paper presents results from a study that analyzed the efficacy of low-stakes distributed teams. We examined whether low-stakes teams that communicate through Google Hangouts can provide educational benefits, in terms of both engagement and learning outcomes, compared to students who are learning via video in a co-located setting or individually.

Despite the importance of social investment and persistent poverty in areas where illicit crops are grown, there is no empirical evidence of the effect of social expenditures on preventing and reducing the expansion of illicit crops. Methods: This paper analyses how social investment in conjunction with eradication affects new coca crops. The model is tested using a dataset consisting of annual data for 440 contiguous municipalities that had coca in any year between 2001 and 2010. The analysis includes the two main techniques used to control illicit crops, manual eradication and aerial spraying. Results: Aerial spraying is effective in deterring farmers from increasing the size of their new coca fields, but this effect is small. Social investment, in addition to generating social welfare, has a significant negative relationship with new coca crops, 0.09-hectare reduction in new coca crops per additional 50-cent spent in social investment (human capital and infrastructure) per inhabitant.

The first mode poses patient privacy concerns, especially as the sharing network grows. The second mode places a significant burden on both patients and providers.

It then analyzes a number of solutions that have been proposed to address image-sharing needs in different scenarios. Finally, it describes an image-sharing framework that involves patients as an integral part of, and with full control of, the image-sharing process. Central to this framework is the Patient Controlled Access-key REgistry (PCARE), which manages the access keys issued by image source facilities that uniquely identify patients’ imaging data. When digitally signed by patients, the access keys can be used by any requesting facility to retrieve the associated imaging data from the source facility. This approach allows patients to control the image-sharing process with a minimal burden. It enables healthcare facilities to exchange imaging data with direct consent from patients in a manner that protects privacy and confidentiality.

There are four classes of β-lactamase enzymes, each with characteristic sequence and structure properties. Enzymes from class A are the most common and have been well characterized across the family; however, less is known about how physicochemical properties vary across the C and D families. In this report, we compare the dynamical properties of four AmpC (class C) β-lactamases using our distance constraint model (DCM). The DCM reliably predicts thermodynamic and mechanical properties in an integrated way. As a consequence, quantitative stability/flexibility relationships (QSFR) can be determined and compared across the whole family. The DCM calculates a large number of QSFR metrics. Perhaps the most useful is the flexibility index (FI), which quantifies flexibility along the enzyme backbone. As typically observed in other systems, FI is well conserved across the four AmpC enzymes. Cooperativity correlation (CC), which quantifies intramolecular couplings within structure, is rarely conserved across protein families; however, it is in AmpC. In particular, the bulk of each structure is composed of a large rigid cluster, punctuated by three flexibly correlated regions located at the active site. These regions include several catalytic residues and the Ù-loop. This evolutionary conservation combined with active their site location strongly suggests that these coupled dynamical modes are important for proper functioning of the enzyme.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2015.0

The authors collected data on these constructs from a sample (N = 319) of bereaved adults. A canonical correlation analysis showed that individuals who engage in traditional spiritual practices and strive to achieve ordinary and transcendental spiritual goals are more likely to engage in positive religious coping (Wilks's Λ =.36, Rc 2 =.62, p &lt;.001). Also, a multiple regression analysis revealed that individuals with higher levels of ethnic identity development are more likely to engage in positive religious coping (β =.12, t &lt;.05).

2-s2.0-84961377484,Article,"Background: The diffusion of component content management and structured authoring workflows and technologies in technical communication requires that instructors of documentation courses determine effective ways to teach component content management to students who may initially be intimidated by authoring environments and structures, such as the Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA). This teaching case describes how component content management and DITA were integrated into the Creating User Documentation course of an undergraduate professional writing program. Research questions: How can instructors of technical and professional writing best teach English and humanities students to operate within a structured authoring workflow? How can computational abstraction be combined with students' previously acquired genre knowledge to ease their adoption of the DITA to create technical documentation? Situating the case: The development of this course was informed by literature from a variety of scholarly and industry sources, which reveal connections between DITA, computational thinking, and Rhetorical Genre theory. Specifically, the concept of 'layers of abstraction' guides the development of the course's structure, allowing students to separate and independently process the various aspects of a structured authoring workflow. How the case was studied: The case was studied informally through the experience of the authors as they developed and taught the course, through informal discussions and structured interviews with industry professionals, and through student reflections from discussion forum posts from Fall 2012 through Fall 2013. About the case: Initially developed with a focus on print manuals and online help, the course began teaching topic-based authoring in the mid-2000s; however, most enterprise-level editors and tools were cost-prohibitive for students and faculty. Furthermore, many computing concepts associated with structured authoring were intimidating for an audience of students in an English department. An affordable solution was adopting the open-source DITA standard, using free trials or open-source editors. The intimidation factor was minimized by designing the course around five layers of abstraction that draw on students' previous rhetorical knowledge: Layer 1: Developing quality documentation, Layer 2: Separating content from design, Layer 3: Authoring granular content with XML, Layer 4: Authoring and linking Component Content Management modules with DITA, and Layer 5: Single-sourcing and content reuse. This case discusses each layer of abstraction, the associated assignments for each layer, and the results of each layer based on student feedback. Results and conclusions: Although the course is not universally loved by students, it has seen many successes and provides a much-needed foundation in component content management and structured authoring for students who might become technical communicators. The teaching team has learned to avoid overemphasizing coding and automation in structured authoring, maintain a solid grounding on writing principles and good technical communication requirements, and draw upon students' existing knowledge of genres and their constraints.",Computing and Informatics,SIS,2015.0
2-s2.0-84961379427,Article,"Alternative splicing enables a single gene to produce multiple mRNA isoforms by varying splice site selection. In animals, alternative splicing of mRNA isoforms between cell types is widespread and supports cellular differentiation. In plants, at least 20% ofmulti-exon genes are alternatively spliced, but the extent and significance of tissue-specific splicing is less well understood, partly because it is difficult to isolate cells of a single type. Pollen is a useful model system to study tissue-specific splicing in higher plants because pollen grains contain only two cell types and can be collected in large amounts without damaging cells. Previously, we identified pollen-specific splicing patterns by comparing RNA-Seq data from Arabidopsis pollen and leaves. Here, we used semi-quantitative PCR to validate pollen-specific splicing patterns among genes where RNA-Seq data analysis indicated splicing was most different between pollen and leaves. PCR testing confirmed eight of nine alternative splicing patterns, and results from the ninth were inconclusive. In four genes, alternative transcriptional start sites coincided with alternative splicing. This study highlights the value of the low-cost PCR assay as a method of validating RNA-Seq results.",Computing and Informatics,Bioinformatics,2015.0

2-s2.0-84961774452,Conference Paper,"Demand response (DR) programs enable the demand side to actively optimize its consumption in response to the dynamic prices. The flexibility of consumption can be a useful tool for the electricity market to resolve many of its operation and reliability issues. Several models have been proposed in the literature to explain the human behavior aspect of the customers. These models are based on the classical utility function, but some studies have shown that the price effect on the customer's decision in areas like energy efficiency and consumption reduction depends upon many behavioral characteristics and without considering such characteristics, the results are unrealistic. Thus, loss aversion plays a crucial role in the decision making. So, in this paper, the impact of two time based rate DR programs have been investigated on the peak reduction considering the loss-aversion and its impact on the perception of the customers. Real time pricing and peak time rebate are two competing alternatives for peak reduction. A modified price elasticity based DR model is proposed to simulate the price response of the customers in the presence of both DR programs. MATLAB software is used to implement the DR models. The models are examined on one of the summer days of 2014 in Connecticut. The data is reported by New England ISO. Two PTR cases are generated for this study, with and without considering the loss aversion. Under both scenarios, without considering the loss aversion, PTR has advantages over RTP, but considering the loss-aversion, RTP showed a superior performance. It is shown that the behavioral characteristics of the customers, loss-aversion in this case, is indispensable in the selection of the proper program.",Business,Economics,2015.0
2-s2.0-84961923784,Conference Paper,"With the rapid development of smart TV industry, a large number of TV programs have been available for meeting various user interests, which consequently raise a great demand of building personalized TV recommender systems. Indeed, a personalized TV recommender system can greatly help users to obtain their preferred programs and assist TV and channel providers to attract more audiences. While different methods have been proposed for TV recommendations, most of them neglect the mixture of watching groups behind an individual TV. In other words, there may be different groups of audiences at different times in front of a TV. For instance, watching groups of a TV may consist of children, wife and husband, husband, wife, etc in many US household. To this end, in this paper, we propose a Mixture Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (mPMF) model to learn the program preferences of televisions, which assumes that the preference of a given television can be regarded as the mixed preference of different watching groups. Specifically, the latent vector of a television is drawn from a mixture of Gaussian and the mixture number is the estimated number of watching groups behind the television. To evaluate the proposed mPMF model, we conduct extensive experiments with many state-of-the-art baseline methods and evaluation metrics on a real-world data set.

Several techniques have been proposed to perform automated thigh tissues quantification. However, none of them has provided an effective method to track fascia lata, which is an important anatomic trail to distinguish between subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and IMAT in the thigh. As a result, the estimates of IMAT may not be accurate due to the unclear appearance cues, complicated anatomic, or pathological characteristics of the fascia lata. Thus, prior tissue information, e.g., intensity, orientation and scale, becomes critical to infer the fascia lata location from magnetic resonance (MR) images. In this paper, we propose a novel detection-driven and sparsity-constrained deformable model to obtain accurate fascia lata labeling. The model's deformation is driven by the detected control points on fascia lata through a discriminative detector in a narrow-band fashion. By using a sparsity-constrained optimization, the deformation is solved from errors and outliers suppression. The proposed approach has been evaluated on a set of 3D MR thigh volumes.

Specifically, we introduce dyadic dispersion LMX as a key dyad-level variable that attenuates the positive individual LMX–performance association. Furthermore, we conceptualize that LMX differentiation, a group-level construct, is dysfunctional for individual outcomes as it violates norms of equality, and we suggest that the positive individual-level LMX–performance ratings association is plausible only in low differentiation workgroups and not high differentiation workgroups. Our analyses invoke new cross-classified and traditional nested models with multisource ratings of performance, and the findings largely support the study hypotheses.

This is why decentralized scheduling algorithms have been developed. The most popular one certainly is work-stealing because of its interesting theoretical guarantees. Parallel systems have evolved from homogeneous clusters to fully heterogeneous ones such as GPU-accelerated clusters. We investigate in this paper decentralized scheduling algorithms for heterogeneous systems. The guarantees of work-stealing algorithms no longer hold on such systems because it is an a posteriori algorithm which highly depends on the initial distribution of work. We focus on a priori decentralized scheduling algorithms for heterogeneous systems and we propose two distributed algorithms to balance the load on unrelated machines for two particular cases. The first one exploits a low heterogeneity in the task set and reaches an approximation ratio linear in the number of types of tasks. The second one focuses on the case where the system only uses two different types of machines and we show it is a 2-approximation if the system converges. In the case it does not converge, we study the dynamic equilibrium of the system. In the homogeneous case, we numerically compute the probability density function of the load imbalance and show that the imbalance is low on average. And we show using simulation that the heterogeneous case is similar to the homogeneous case and that the imbalance is low in both cases.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2015.0

How to distribute the input data to be able to execute a set of tasks in a minimum amount of time can be modeled as a scheduling problem. Often these models assume that the computation time required for each task is known accurately. However in many practical case, only approximate values are available at the time of scheduling. In this paper, we investigate how replicating the data required by the tasks can help coping with the inaccuracies of the processing times. In particular, we investigate the problem of scheduling independent tasks to optimize the make span on a parallel system where the processing times of the tasks are only known up to a multiplicative factor. The problem is decomposed in two phases: a first offline phase where the data of the tasks are placed and a second online phase where the tasks are actually scheduled. For this problem we investigate three different strategies, each allowing a different degree of replication of tasks: a) No Replication b) Replication everywhere and c) Replication in groups. We propose approximation algorithms and theoretical lower bound on achievable approximation ratios. This allows us to study the trade off between the number of replication and the guarantee on the makespan.",Computing and Informatics,Computer Science,2015.0

However, existing works are sensitive to the topology noises induced by the firstK neighbors. In this paper, we tackle the problem by studying metric transformation which aims at finding new functional relationship to dig the latent similarity. The advantage of the approach lies in its robustness towards the varying K values; that is to say, it could preserve high similarity performances even if K is very large. Except for discussing only the global KNN (i.e. the same K for all neighborhoods) graph, we also investigate to specify a different K for each neighborhood by incorporating the new penalized consensus information (PCI).

These are known as attacks on RSs and are typically used to either promote (""push"") or disparage (""nuke"") targeted items contained within the recommender's user-item dataset. Our recent work with the Power User Attack (PUA) model, determined that attackers disguised as influential power users can mount successful (from the attacker's viewpoint) push attacks against userbased, item-based, and SVD-based recommenders. However, the success of push attack vectors may not be symmetric for nuke attacks, which target the opposite effect-reducing the likelihood that target items appear in users' top-N lists. The asymmetry between push and nuke attacks is highlighted when evaluating these attacks using traditional robustness metrics such as Rank and Prediction Shift. This paper examines the PUA attack model in the context of nuke attacks, in order to investigate the differences between push and nuke attack orientations, as well as how they are evaluated.

We design a novel sphere-tree model for objects with sharp features and use a configuration-based optimization method to compute feedback force and torque. Given a triangle mesh of an object, a sphere-tree model is created based on dihedral angles between pairs of adjacent triangles. The model consists of a hierarchical sphere-tree for global shape and a linked-list of spheres for local areas with sharp features. In each local area with a sharp edge, we first identify those spheres with radii greater than an upper limit determined by the dihedral angle of the edge. Those spheres are further divided into a linear list of smaller spheres by a splitting method. The experiment results from a cylinder-cube interaction validate that the proposed method can simulate subtle force direction changes when an object slides across sharp edges. Perception-based experiments and a haptic-to-vision shape matching task are also used to compare the performance between our proposed method and other rendering methods. The comparison results show that our method is more effective in simulating sharp features both in terms of measured force signals and human subjective evaluation.

Comprehensive Care for HIV/AIDS is the result of collaborative work with the county Health Department, numerous community-based organizations, and several planning boards in a metropolitan area, which have sought to provide integrated care to people living with HIV. It will be a valuable resource to the diverse community of HIV researchers, advocates and providers.",Liberal Arts and Sciences,Sociology,2014.0

However, amid the wealth of data and statistics on the topic, a viable theoretical explanation, that helps to make sense of the disproportionately high number of suspensions for Black males, remains relatively absent. Drawing upon the Method of Theory Triangulation, this chapter uses three conceptual frames to develop a plausible, causal narrative for deconstructing how pose, perception, and threat converge create a perfect storm of conditions that perpetuate discriminatory discipline practices. Based on the theoretical considerations implicit in this account, practical recommendations are offered to educational stakeholders who might be interested in improving school discipline practices and reducing the number of Black males disproportionately targeted for disciplinary action.",Education,"Middle, Secondary, and K-12 Education",2014.0
2-s2.0-84969217683,"General Publications (Press, Editorials, Letters)","International assessment data consistently indicate that when compared to their peers from other major developed nations, American students, irrespective of their race, underperform in reading and mathematics (Darling Hammond, 2010; NCES, 2011; PIRLS, 2011; PISA, 2009; TIMSS, 2011). Within an American context, African American males generally have the lowest reading scores as compared to their White peers (Husband, 2012; NCES, 2011; Schott Foundation, 2010; Spellings Report, 2006). Existing research indicates that these disparities in academic performance are a result of inequalities in access to quality education and differences in the treatment of students, which are deeply imbedded in historical patterns of racial, gendered, and class discrimination. However, past studies also indicate that these same students optimize their learning experiences and become high performers when they receive high quality instruction and school enrichments. Thus, this chapter examines the use of Readers Theater as an instructional model that may help to enhance the school achievement of student groups, such as African American males. The chapter documents the challenges that Black males face in schools and proposes performing arts education as a mediating mechanism and reading enhancement tool. Additionally, it includes an in-depth description of Readers Theater and examines several studies on this instructional method and its potential impact on African American males and their reading skills.",Education,"Middle, Secondary, and K-12 Education",2014.0
