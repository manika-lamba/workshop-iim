As collection and staff budgets dwindle, the skill set of art librarians is rapidly expanding. New tools are needed to keep up with the field as it moves away from traditional priorities—subject knowledge, foreign language proficiency, and professional tasks such as cataloging, indexing, abstracting, and collecting—and toward new ways of connecting with patrons and communities. This article examines the current skills needed by art librarians, with an emphasis on academic librarianship, and offers insights for individuals pursuing careers in art librarianship. © 2020 by The Art Libraries Society of North America.

Academic libraries formulate missions, visions, goals, and objectives based on the aims of the parent organization. There are issues with how librarianship is introduced, particularly in post-generation Z, when individuals have misconceptions about the functions of librarians. This study examined the level of professional competencies and job performance of selected academic librarians in the 21st Century. Methods. Descriptive-correlation method of research was used to provide static pictures of situations as well as to establish relationship between different variables. The respondents of this study are selected academic librarians in region IV-A Philippines. Results. Findings revealed that majority of respondents were 31 years old and above and were female. Meanwhile, the majority of the respondents attained their bachelor's degree and had been in the service for 10 years and below. The academic librarians are highly competent in managing information technologies among three domains of professional competencies. The academic librarians achieve very high level of job performance maintaining high quantity of work, fulfilling job duties, consistent for high quality of work, respond to the needs of users, provide accurate resources, demonstrate responsiveness, are able to use technology, and actively participate in forums. The academic librarians aged 31 years old and above, with master's degree and have 11 years and above of service, higher level of professional competencies than their younger counterpart, with bachelor's degree and 10 years and below of service. The higher the respondents' level of professional competencies in all its dimensions, the higher the level of respondent’s job performance. Conclusions. It can be concluded that the majority of academic librarians in this study were female, 31 years old and above. They had a bachelor's degree and 10 years or less of service. Academic librarians showed high competence in managing information technologies and consistently performed well in their job duties. Older librarians with a master's degree and over 11 years of service displayed higher professional competency and job performance compared to younger librarians with a bachelor's degree and less than 10 years of service. There was a positive correlation between professional competencies and job performance. Overall, academic librarians in this study exhibited strong professional competencies and high job performance. © A. Duguil, J. Padilla, N. C. Rambuyon, J. M.

This study aims to determine the skills and knowledge needed for LIS professionals in the job market to rethink the current syllabus and offer better future employability. Design/methodology/approach: The research used a survey method to collect data concerning personal information, LIS employment opportunities, job titles and skills needed. Content analysis followed to determine librarianship job listings and the need for LIS graduate jobs in Kuwait. Findings: The findings suggested difficulties and challenges; they also compiled a comprehensive list of skills needed and recommended courses and institutions hiring LIS graduates. The research improves decision-making in syllabus development and experiences recommended by employers. Practical implications: Academic departments can follow this research to develop and update their syllabuses according to the requirements of the job market, thus offering better future job opportunities. Social implications: As LIS graduates are provided with better education, the updating of their employability skills will help them socially by recognising their employment status and economically by raising their pay. Originality/value: The research is the first in Kuwait to collect LIS job titles and analyse employability needs. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Content analysis; Graduate employment; Information and communication technologies; Job market; Job title; Kuwait; Library and information science; Syllabus development","","","","","","Public Authority for Applied Education and Training, PAAET","Funding: This research was partially funded by the Public Authority for Applied Education and Training.

We interviewed eight early career researchers (ECRs) composed of doctoral students or recent graduates about their overall scholarly workflows including not only search but also social networking around scholarly information and production of scholarly works. Evidence suggests that search itself is less discrete and library-centric than prior models may have suggested, and that students use both social resources and non-library technologies to discover and locate scholarly works. We argue that taking a workflow-centric and collaboration-centric view, rather than a search-centric view, should inform design of tools and training for search of scholarly resources. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Academic librarianship; Graduate Students; Information Literacy; Scholarly workflow; Search","Academic librarianship; Graduate students; Information literacy; Scholarly workflow; Search; Students","","","","","","","Budd J.M., User-centered thinking: Lessons from the reader-centered theory, RQ, 34, 4, pp. 487-496, (1995); Budd J.M., The complexity of information retrieval: A hypothetical example, Journal of Academic Librarianship, 22, 2, pp. 111-117, (1996); De Tiratel S.R., Accessing information use by humanists and social scientists: A study at the Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina, Journal of Academic Librarianship, 26, 5, pp. 346-354, (2000); Favaro S., Hoadley C., The changing role of digital tools and academic libraries in scholarly workflows: A review, Nordic Journal of Information Literacy in Higher Education, 6, 1, pp. 6-22, (2014); Hagund L., Solsson P., The impact on university libraries of changes in information behavior among academic researchers: A multiple case study, Journal of Academic Librarianship, 34, 1, pp. 52-59, (2008); Harris C., The case for partnering doctoral students with librarians: A synthesis of the literatures, Library Review, 60, 7, pp. 599-620, (2011); Ince S., Hoadley C., Kirschner P., The Role of Libraries in Information and Digital Literacy Skills for Doctoral Students; Keenan S., Johnston C., Concise Dictionary of Library and Information Science, (2000); Nicholars D., Boukacem-Zeghmouri C., Rodriguez-Bravo B., Xu J., Watkinson A., Abrizah A., Swigon M., Where and how early career researchers find scholarly information, Learned Publishing, 30, 1, pp. 19-29, (2017); Orlikowsky W., Iacono C.S., Desperately seeking ""IT"" in IT research — A call to theorizing the IT artifact, Information Systems Research, 12, 2, pp. 121-134, (2001); Saldana J., The Coding Manual for Qualitative Researchers, (2015); Yin R.K., Case Study Research, (2015)","","","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","Special Interest Group on Information Retrieval (ACM SIGIR)","3rd ACM SIGIR Conference on Human Information Interaction and Retrieval, CHIIR 2018","11 March 2018 through 15 March 2018","New Brunswick","135045","","978-145034925-3","","","English","CHIIR - Proc.

The survey method was used to collect data from study participants. Semi-structured questionnaires were sent to 279 subject/learning support librarians, and semi-structured telephonic interviews were conducted with selected library managers from selected institutions included in the survey. The study revealed that most respondents held degrees and/or postgraduate qualifications in library and information science, that more than half of them also held qualifications in other disciplines at various levels, and that many of them felt that they needed to acquire more information and communication technology skills. © 2017, Published with license by Taylor & Francis © 2017, © Bernadette Chanetsa and Patrick Ngulube.","competencies; faculty librarians; information librarians; qualifications; skills; Subject librarians","","","","","","","","Agyen-Gyasi K., The need for subject librarians in Ghanaian academic libraries, Electronic Journal of Academic and Special Librarianship, 9, 3, pp. 1-13; Armstrong C., Working as a librarian; Standards for proficiencies for instruction librarians and coordinators; Auckland M., Re-skilling for research; Balnaves M., Caputi P., Introduction to quantitative research methods: An investigative approach; Battin P.M., Librarianship in the twenty-first century, The Courier Paper, 316; Bewick L., Corrall S., Developing librarians as teachers: A study of their pedagogical knowledge; Biddiscombe R., Learning support professionals: The changing role of subject specialists in UK academic libraries, Program: Electronic Library and Information Systems, 36, 4, pp. 228-235; Brewerton A., … and any other duties deemed necessary”: An analysis of subject librarian job descriptions, SCONUL Focus, 51, pp. 60-67; Brewerton A., Re-skilling for research: Investigating the needs of researchers and how library staff can best support them, New Review of Academic Librarianship, 18, pp. 96-110; Cataldo T.T., Tennant M.R., Sherwill-Navarro P., Jesano R., Subject specialization in a liaison librarian program, Journal of the Medical Library Association, 94, 4, pp. 446-448; Chawner B., Oliver G., A survey of New Zealand academic reference librarians: Current and future skills and competencies, Australian Academic & Research Libraries, 44, 1, pp. 29-39; Collier M., Convergence of libraries with other academic services; Corcoran M., McGuiness C., Keeping ahead of the curve: Academic librarians and continuing professional development, Library Management, 35, 3, pp. 175-198; Corrall S., Rethinking professional competence for the networked environment, Developing academic library staff for future success, pp. 15-39; Dale P., Professional engagement—The subject specialist in higher education, Subject librarians: Engaging with the learning and teaching environment, pp. 19-31; DeCandido G.A., New jobs for old: Librarians now, Leading Ideas, 14, pp. 1-24; Feetham M., The subject specialist in higher education: A review of the literature, Subject librarians: Engaging with the learning and teaching environment, pp. 3-17; Feret B., Marcinek M., The future of the academic library and the academic librarian: A Delphi study, Librarian Career Development, 7, 10, pp. 91-107; Fourie I., Librarians and the claiming of new roles: How can we try to make a difference?, Aslib Proceedings, 56, 1, pp. 62-74; Gulati A., Raina R.L., Professional competencies among librarians and information professionals in the knowledge era, World Libraries, 10, 1-2; Hay F.J., The subject specialist in the academic library: A review article, The Journal of Academic Librarianship, 16, 1, pp. 11-17; Hernon P., Components of the research process: Where do we need to focus attention?

Because of the insuficient previous research on the topic of law li-brarianship in the Republic of Croatia, the aim of the paper was to gain insight into the context of law librarianship and the necessary competences for librarians who work in the law libraries, particularly in the view of today’s labor market demands, changes in higher education, and the rapid development of information and communication technologies. The purpose of the paper is to draw attention to the importance of developing specif-ic competencies and skills for working in law libraries, the importance of understanding a holistic and interdisciplinary approach to law librarianship as well as the importance of lifelong education for law librarians. The following research questions arise from the aforementioned: What does the concept of law librarianship mean? Who are law librarians? What competencies and skills must they have for working in law and related libraries? What do employers expect from a law librarian with regard to the demands of today’s labour market? Approach / methodology. The methodology used included a qualitative approach to the research, which included the content analysis method. The analysis unit for the research was the information on the knowledge, competences, and skills of librarians. Findings. The analysis of a selection of literature has shown that, in view of today’s labour market demands, the librarians working in law libraries should possess, besides librarianship knowledge, the knowledge in the field of law and continuously develop the necessary lifelong competences and skills, such as the development of pedagogical competences, information and information skills literacy, enhancing professional skills as essential preconditions in order to fulfil numerous job requirements. Practical implications. At the practical level, the discussion on the topic has been opened and the guidelines for the competency profile of librarians employed in law libraries have been given. Originality/value. At the theoretical level, considering the small number of pub-lished papers and insufficient exploration of the topic of law librarianship in the Republic of Croatia, a more detailed insight into the context of law librarianship and the work of librarians in law libraries is given. © VBH 2018.","Law librarians; Law librarianship; The competences of an academic librarian","","","","","","","","Competencies of Law Librarianship; Law Student Research Competencies and Information Literacy Standards, (2012); Arp L., Woodard B.S., Faculty librarian collaboration to achieve integration of Information literacy, Reference User Services Quarterly, 46, 1, pp. 18-23, (2006); Australian and New Zealand Information Literacy Framework: Principles, Standards and Practice / Editor Alan Bundy, (2004); Bacic E., Peradenic-Kotur B., Panel rasprava Slobodan pristup pravnim informacijama, Vjesnik Bibliotekara Hrvatske, 58, 1-2, pp. 413-420, (2015); Bast C.M., Pyle R.C., Legal Research in the Computer AgeA Paradigm Shift?, Law Library Journal, 93, 2, pp. 285-302, (2001); Beljaars B., Implementing Legal Information Literacy: A Challenge for the Curriculum, International Journal of Legal Information, 37, 3, (2009); Brookes S., Educating aspiring law librarians: A student’s perspective, Law Library Journal, 97, 3, pp. 517-536, (2005); Butler H.A., Frederick Hicks’s Strategic Vision for Law Librarianship, Law Library Journal, 98, 2, pp. 367-379, (2006); Callister P.D., Beyond training: Law librarianship’s quest for the pedagogy of legal research education, Law Library Journal, 7, 9, pp. 7-45, (2003); Constable T., Legal knowledge and expertise: What law librarians should know, Mo-Usaion., 21, 2, pp. 138-147, (2003); Corrall S., O'Brien J., Developing the legal information professional: A study of competency, education and training needs, Aslib Proceedings, 63, 2-3, pp. 295-320, (2011); Creswell J.V., Educational Research: Planning, Conducting, and Evaluating Quantitative and Qualitative Research, (2013); Cuffe N., Law Students Experiences If Information Tehnology: Implications for Legal Information Literacy Curriculum Development; Davies J., Jackson C., Information literacy in the law curriculum: Experiences from Cardiff, Law Teacher, 39, 2, pp. 1-14, (2005); Donovan J.M., Order matters: Typology of dual-degreed law librarians. // Legal Reference Services Quarterly 33, 1(2014), 1-37.

The international literature has been generally positive towards this new piece of research infrastructure, particularly based on its obvious potential to aid name disambiguation. However, a small number of commentators have highlighted negative issues with ORCID, as well as the way in which they are increasing mandated by publishers, funders, and even employers. This research sought to critically evaluate perceptions of ORCID in the Technological University (TU)/Institute of Technology (IoT) sector in Ireland. Methodology: This study adopted a mixed methods approach involving an online survey with academics in Ireland's TU/IoT sector and a survey of senior librarians. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to explore the qualitative data collected via open-ended questions. Findings: The results indicate that most lecturers have only minimally engaged with ORCID. Thematic analysis of responses from faculty identified six distinct themes. The majority of themes identified were negative towards ORCID, with many lecturers appearing unsure about its purpose, having only registered for ORCID because of external pressure. Faculty were also concerned that ORCID could facilitate external monitoring, as well as them being resistant to the effort involved in keeping an ORCID profile up to date. ORCID was also seen as a potential source of danger, although some lecturers had started to use their ORCID profile to promote their work. Perceptions amongst librarians were very different, with librarians notably more in favour of ORCID. Three themes were identified: name disambiguation, facilitation of linkages with other IT systems, and future potential. Originality: The paper offers a critical analysis of ORCID adoption in Ireland based on perceptions amongst two stakeholder groups, academics and librarians. © 2024 The Author(s)","Academic identity; Higher education; Librarianship; ORCID; Research monitoring; Scholarly publishing","","","","","","","","Allen L., Connecting researchers and research – Investing in infrastructure to bring efficiencies to research.

Design/methodology/approach: This study uses interviews (qualitative) to collect data from women technology librarians who work in an academic library within the United States. Research limitations/implications: The generalizability of the findings is due to the sample consisting of only academic librarians within the United States. The methodology also has limitations since interviews are not a perfect methodology and rely on self-reported descriptions and experiences; thus, may be susceptible to perceptional biases. The findings from the research also rely only on the gender variable while ignoring other variables that affect an individual's experiences. Practical implications: Organizations need to reevaluate perceptions of women's OCB and the structural barriers they encounter. Originality/value: This study contributes to the literature on gender and organizational citizenship behavior and gender and librarianship.

Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative method with the usage of questionnaires as well as the content analysis was used for data collection. Findings: The research discovered that there is an impending need for AR in academic libraries, especially in this 21st century filled with ever-evolving technological advancements. Additionally, the research outlined the importance for academic libraries to tap into this are for greater access to its services by students off-campus as well as the physically challenged individuals. Research limitations/implications: This paper will only be focusing on the benefits of AR for academic libraries and their furtherance. It will not attest to the cost of implementation as well as it will not consider the maintenance of it for academic libraries in the Caribbean. Practical implications: The research disclosed numerous benefits for academic libraries in the Caribbean in developing AR collections. Additionally, with the increasing use and development of technologies in libraries, it is the ideal medium for distance learning as well as greater access to libraries by its students and other users. Originality/value: This paper is the penultimate appetizer for the AR conversation and, by extension, implementation. Additionally, it sets the framework for researchers and practitioners that the application service is lacking despite the rise of technological advancements in the Caribbean. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Academic librarianship; Augmented reality; Distance library services; Information and communications technologies; Library augmented reality services; Web 2.0","","","","","","","","Biocca F., Owen C., Tang A., Bohil C., Attention issues in spatial information systems: directing mobile users’ visual attention using augmented reality, Journal of Management Information Systems, 23, 4, pp. 163-184, (2007); Dill E., Do clickers improve library instruction?

The paper relies on the theoretical constructs from Bell and Shank's (2004, 2007) blended librarianship and Lave and Wenger's (1991) Legitimate Peripheral Participation (LPP) to understand how Zimbabwean academic librarians practice blended librarianship in the workplace through engagement in legitimate work tasks. The investigators used phenomenology to explore academic librarians' experiences of blended librarianship. They selected a sample of 101 academic librarians and delivered a semi-structured questionnaire to the sample, conducted document research and interviewed key informants from the sample. The researchers collected data from the Bindura University of Science Education, Chinhoyi University of Technology, Lupane State University, Midlands State University, the National University of Science and Technology, and PHSBL80 Library which chose to be undisclosed. Each institution adopted blended librarianship in its way. Four (4) different categories of blended librarianship emerged from the experiences; that is “transcending blended librarians”, “partially blended librarians”, “intermittent blended librarians” and “aspiring blended librarians”, displaying each institution's level of instructional technology and instructional design roles. The study proposes that the “Academic librarian's transition to blended librarianship” two-by-two matrix that developed was in this inquiry needs further refinement. Further enquiries may test the matrix within the same sites or other locales altogether to corroborate if the results are replicable. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Academic librarian's transition to blended librarianship; Academic librarianship; Blended librarianship; Zimbabwe","","","","","","","","Adams C., Van Manen M., Phenomenology, The Sage encyclopedia of qualitative research methods, pp. 614-619, (2008); Adamson J., Gooberman-Hill R., Woolhead G., Donovan J., “Questerviews”: Using questionnaires in qualitative interviews as a method of integrating qualitative and quantitative health services research, Journal of Health Services Research & Policy, 9, 3, pp. 139-145, (2004); Ahern K.J., Ten tips for reflexive bracketing, Qualitative Health Research, 9, 3, pp. 407-411, (1999); Anderson K., May F.A., Does the method of instruction matter?

These models comprise the factors which play a part between people, technology and organizations. The purpose of this study was to specify and examine an integrated digital library user success (IDLUS) model within the context of digital library settings, Higher Education Commission National Digital Library (HEC-NDL) of Pakistan, by adopting and reusing the existing digital library and Web success models. Design/methodology/approach: Stratified random sampling technique was used to choose the sample from the University of the Punjab, a highly ranked public sector university in Pakistan. Participants were asked to complete an adapted survey questionnaire. A total of 355 completed and usable questionnaires were obtained. Data analyses through confirmatory factor analyses and structural equation modeling produced the results that have supported the proposed IDLUS model. The proposed IDLUS model was tested and supported through model fit statistics in the academic computing environment of the HEC-NDL of Pakistan. Findings: Findings revealed that relationships between the latent variables hypothesized in the model were confirmed. Research limitations/implications: The study has both theoretical and practical ramifications for academicians and information system designers and developers. Originality/value: The IDLUS model is recommended first time in the history of librarianship in Pakistan as an overall user success model in the digital library information system computing environment. That made numerous recommendations for future research in the field of information management, particularly for digital library development at national and international levels. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","End-user computing satisfaction model; Flow theory; Information system success theory; Overall user satisfaction model; Pakistan; Structural equation modeling","adult; article; confirmatory factor analysis; data analysis; female; human; human experiment; information system; library; male; Pakistan; public sector; questionnaire; satisfaction; structural equation modeling; tertiary education; theoretical study","","","","","","","Abdulkareem A.K., Ramli R.M., Does digital literacy predict e-government performance?

This exciting partnership evolves from common historic roots, a strong alignment of values, and effectively addresses changing community needs that aligns with both professions. Social work and public libraries are both products of the Progressive Era along with the rise of charitable organizations and settlement houses. In examining the evolution of libraries in the wake of changing technology and patron populations, social workers are critical community allies to respond to diverse community needs. Social workers, human service providers, and funders also now see public libraries as community centers and civic hubs, as well as even settlement houses for the 21st Century. Libraries serve as civic hubs that are essential connectors of information, education, resources, and access that addresses human needs. This commentary’s aim in exploring library social worker practice encourages community-university partnerships between our public libraries and the academic programs of social work and library science that strengthen civic and community engagement. Social work practitioners and educators are encouraged to spend more time at their public libraries through interprofessional internships, class projects, applied research, and dual-degree curricular development that can prepare next generation practitioner to work and lead in these community centers. © 2020 Authors.","Community engagement; Interprofessional collaboration; Library social work practice; Lifelong community learning centers; Whole person librarianship","","","","","","","","ALA library fact sheet 1 – the number of libraries in the United States, (2019); State of America’s Libraries Report 2020; Aykanian A., Morton P., Trawver K., Victorson L., Preskitt S., Street K., Library-based field placements: Meeting the diverse needs of patrons, including those experiencing homelessness, Journal of Social Work Education, 56, pp. 72-80, (2020); Blank B.

In addition, this study will determine the extent to which mobile services has helped the Mona libraries to have greater reach to students. Design/methodology/approach: Surveys and content analysis were used to collect data. A comparative content analysis was used to highlight the strides made in mobile library services in universities across the world vis-à-vis the current reality in the Caribbean, specifically Jamaica. Findings: The findings identified that there is a proliferation of mobile and internet users among university and college students and they are heavily using their devices for the furtherance of their educational attainment. Additionally, the findings indicated that libraries in the academic realm can benefit greatly from allowing their content to be accessible through these mobile devices, as it would also help with greater usage. Furthermore, this service is guaranteed greater support the distance programmes offered by these universities. Research limitations/implications: This study will focus on assessing the state of mobile library services offered at the University of the West Indies, Mona Jamaica. This study will also determine the extent to which mobile services can help libraries to have greater reach to students and provide best practices for academic libraries implementing mobile service offerings to clients. This study will not attest to the financial feasibility of academic institutions to start such a programme. Practical implications: The research excavated that the University of the West Indies, Mona Campus, along with other academic libraries in the Caribbean are all not fully offering mobile library services to all their users. In addition, with the rise of technology and the proliferation of cell phones and other mobile devices, students (distance and onsite) expect a service that allows them greater access to the offerings of the university and their libraries. Originality/value: This is the premier investigation of its kind into how the University of the West Indies Mona Campus has responded to the mobile library environment. The value of this research is in helping academic and university libraries in the Jamaica to identify the importance of leveraging the benefits of the dynamic technological era, allowing greater and wider reach through mobile library services proliferation and access to services. In addition, this study showed that academic libraries need to enhance services in a bid to provide greater support the teaching component of the university or college they serve. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Academic librarianship; DistanceLibrary services; Information and communication technologies; Mobile communications services; Mobile library services; Web 2.0","","","","","","","","Albrecht B., Pirani J.A., Massachusetts institute of technology: transforming the campus experience with the MIT mobile web, Boulder, Co: EDUCAUSE Center for Applied Research, (2009); Barnhar F.D., Pierce J.E., Becoming mobile: reference in the ubiquitous library, Journal of Library Administration, 52, 6-7, pp. 559-570, (2012); Bomhold C.R., Educational use of smart phone technology, Program, (2013); Canuel R., Crichton C., Librarians, smartphones, and mobile learning: a Canadian perspective, Poster presented at the Annual Meeting of the American Library Association, (2010); Dahlstrom E., Walker J.D., Dziuban C., ECAR Study of Undergraduate Students and Information Technology, (2013); Greenall R.T., Mobiles in libraries, Online, 34, 2, (2010); Jensen R.B., Optimizing library content for mobile phones, Library Hi Tech News, 27, 2, pp. 6-9, (2010); La Counte, Scott, Introduction, Mobile Library Services: Best Practices, pp. 5-7, (2013); Lippincott J.K., Mobile technologies, mobile users: implications for academic libraries, ARL: A Bimonthly Report on Research Library Issues and Actions from ARL, CNI, and SPARC, 261, pp. 1-4, (2008); Luo L., Bell L., Text 4 answers: a collaborative service model, Reference Services Review, 38, 2, pp. 274-283, (2010); Mizrachi D., Undergraduates' academic information and library behaviors: preliminary results, Reference Services Review, 38, 4, pp. 571-580, (2010); Murphy J., Using mobile devices for research: smartphones, databases, and libraries, Online, 34, 3, pp. 14-18, (2010); Nelson K., Exploring the use of text messaging to enhance reference services the university of the west indies library, Mona campus, Caribbean Library Journal, 1, 1, pp. 1-18, (2013); Pearce A., Collard S., Whatley K., SMS reference: myths, markers, and modalities, Reference Services Review, 38, 2, pp. 250-263, (2010); Thomas L.C., Gone mobile?

Librarians traditionally hail from the humanities, especially English and history. But as current educational attention shifts to science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields, are librarians reflecting this change? Anonymized data from ALA-accredited graduate programs from the last five years were collected, coded, and classified to determine librarians' educational and disciplinary backgrounds and in what ways, if any, they differ from the past 65 years and from the contemporary US general population. Unsurprisingly, we found that contemporary librarians still hail predominantly from English and history'a stark contrast from the business and health undergraduate degrees earned by the general US population. Backgrounds in STEM fields remain lacking in librarianship, but librarians with undergraduate education in the arts are on the rise, perhaps supporting the creativity, flexibility, innovation, and risk taking necessary in twenty-first-century libraries. © 2018 Journal of Education for Library and Information Science.","Academic disciplines;

Within this context, this study, forming part of ongoing doctoral research, analyzes students’ opinions on how to enhance library school curricula to effectively respond to academic librarians’ new roles and functions. By repositioning the lens on the practical and experience-driven student perspective, away from standard educational practices, the researchers pilot-tested a library science student survey. The mix-methods, student co-developed, survey instrument was tested with a small self-selection sample of future information professionals in Spain and Greece. The study’s goal was to contribute to the limited body of research concerning students´ perceptions and awareness about library science education. Survey participants were providedthe opportunity to critically evaluate their library schoolundergraduate programs’ responsiveness to the changing academic librarianship landscape. Responses, analyzed by using descriptive statistical and inductive thematic techniques, revealed a limited academic librarianship related content in library and information science curricula. Furthermore, results highlighted a reserved optimism with respect to the library’s prospects of upgrading its role in the university, an ambivalence towards librarian’s future roles, and a diffuse skepticism around the system’s potential to grasp the opportunities that the new information and communication technologies offer. The merit of the study resides in both the diversity of participants’ insightful comments and the use of a student validated survey instrument making them active contributors to the library school program’s assessment process. Dissimilar to stereotypical research projects, this initiative opens a different perspective to program evaluation and its subsequent alignment with academic library stakeholders’ needs. © 2019 University and Research Librarians Association (UNAK).

Thus, the idea of academic librarians being a partner in research rather than mere research supporters is a new development in academic librarianship that requires attention, especially on what academic librarians can do to partner with the research community successfully. Therefore, this study employed a qualitative approach to explore academic librarians’ roles as research partners and the competencies required for better collaborations. Data were generated through face-to-face interviews with 14 academic librarians purposively sampled from a major research university in Nigeria. Ten themes emerged from the findings regarding academic librarians' role as research partners. These include information discovery and provision, information use and evaluation; grants application; articulation of research topic; literature and reference management; research data management, systematic review, authoring a manuscript, scholarly publishing, and research dissemination. Similarly, eleven themes emerged as the competencies required to be analysed under the dimensions of knowledge, skill, and attitude. These include research methodology and research data management as the knowledge needed in a research partnership. While digital scholarship, systematic review, reference / citation management, data curation and preservation, bibliometrics/information evaluation and communication emerged as the skills required for the effective discharge of their responsibilities. Professionalism, patience, and cordiality were found to be the attitude required. This paper is limited to providing academic librarians with the necessary authority to enhance their performance in a research partnership, and offering them the approach to guide their practice in a research partnership. Thus, the study recommended, among others, the need for enlightenment programmes and activities for academic librarians that cut across training, workshops, and organising conferences in research areas in enhancing their service performance to ensure successful research partnerships © 2022, Malaysian Journal of Library and Information Science.All Rights Reserved.","Academic librarians; Competencies; Embedded librarianship; Research partnership; Roles; Scholarly communication","","","","","","","","Adegbaye S.

It envisions an approach on the dissemination of information as an educational tool so that the process of academic training can provide a better use of technologies and actions and bring them closer to teaching, research and extension practices, with regard to establishing and creating opportunities for students to build strategic connections between academic practices with the labor market. It is a qualitative study with a hypothetical-deductive approach, based on the general premise of the role and function of a public, university library. Bibliographic and document analyses were used as means of investigation for this work. This research is characterized as descriptive since it is i ntended to describe and analyze the determining factors for the dissemination of information on innovation and technology in the academic environment. Through a reference service focused on innovation processes and by means of a mobile application, it seeks to build skills for competence in information regarding how patent applications, trademark registrations, copyright applications and software registrations are carried out and demonstrate the relevance of the participation and collaboration of university libraries in institutional development plans. We aim to highlight the importance of developing new educational practices that provide a process of gaining experience, which brings academic research closer to reality even before a student has graduated and helps them to understand the different forms of innovation that may exist in the desired professional field. © 2020, Universidade de Brasilia.

As changes in scientific approaches, technology, scholarly communication, and funding mechanisms occur, libraries supporting scientific areas must be equipped to handle the various needs of these researchers. The purpose of this study was to examine how academic STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) and medical libraries are responding to these changes, specifically in the areas of data and informatics support. An examination of job descriptions between 2005 and 2014 showed an increase over time in the number of advertisements with responsibilities in data or informatics. Our study suggests STEM and medical librarians are responsible for many different data-intensive areas, mostly in data management or curation, although librarians filling many of these positions also had traditional librarianship responsibilities, such as general reference or collection development. The hybrid nature of these positions was also reflected in the job titles, of which nearly half did not indicate that the position had significant data or informatics-related responsibilities. © 2017, Association of College and Research Libraries.

A Powerpoint presentation demonstrates how the VRE functions through a comparative case study of the organization of information in Plato and Aristotle. The interdisciplinary method combines historical, philological, and philosophical techniques with approaches from the digital humanities. The Greek Key is a collaborative, scalable, multidisciplinary project that has the potential to engage librarians in participatory strategies such as crowdsourcing (or “Citizen Science”). The Greek Key tools for visualizing textual data have the potential to: reveal previously undetected patterns in books and collections; make connections among different works; help users bring new information to bear on interpretation; demonstrate the significance of findings; and generate fresh insights about works of literature that have had a central and enduring influence on both our scholarly traditions and the history of libraries and librarianship.

Robarts Library, University of Toronto Libraries, Toronto, ON, Canada","Objective-To determine the extent to which embedded librarianship is understood and implemented with a focus on service models, best practices, and barriers. Design-Survey questionnaire with follow up interviews. Setting-Provincial and ministerial university libraries in China. Subjects-Subject or liaison librarians from the 84 institutions with science and technology ""information searching and evaluation centres"" called S&TNS (p. 56). Methods-The authors identified potential participants through the eligible institutions' library websites or by contacting the library's managers. Then they randomly selected three librarians (n = 252) from each library to be invited to participate. 56 responded from 41 unique institutions. When respondents indicated that their library had embedded library services, the authors contacted them for follow up interviews. Main results-Results of the questionnaire revealed that most respondents were unclear about the concept of embedded librarianship with many mistaking traditional models of librarianship as embedded. Roughly half (n =21) of respondents reported embedded librarians at their institution. Follow up interviews revealed five models of embeddedness: (1) subject librarianship, (2) teaching information retrieval or library orientation sessions, (3) participation in research teams, (4) co-location with academic departments, and (5) assisting university administration with decision-making. Only half of these libraries (n = 11) conducted some form of assessment. Conclusion-Embedded librarianship is a promising, but not yet widely adopted model in Chinese university libraries. More should be done to advocate for its implementation or libraries risk obsolescence. © 2020 Logan.","","","","","","","","","Eysenbach G., Improving the quality of web surveys: The Checklist for Reporting Results of Internet E-Surveys (CHERRIES), Journal of Medical Internet Research, 6, 3, (2004); Glynn L., A critical appraisal tool for library and information research, Library Hi Tech, 24, 3, pp. 387-399, (2006); Tong A., Sainsbury P., Craig J., Consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research (COREQ): A 32-item checklist for interviews and focus groups, International Journal for Quality in Health Care, 19, 6, pp. 349-357, (2007); Vine R., Realigning liaison with university priorities: Observations from ARL Liaison Institutes 2015-18, College & Research Libraries News, 79, 8, pp. 420-424, (2018)","J.

An exploratory cross-sectional design and qualitative and quantitative approaches have been employed by the study to collect data from 166 librarians and 6 library directors. While the data collected using a questionnaire have been analyzed using Statistical Product and Service Solutions version 21, those collected using interviews have been analyzed thematically. The study reveals that librarians have inadequate ICT skills and knowledge needed to effectively implement embedded librarianship. More specifically, the librarians lack the skills and knowledge needed to deploy sophisticated ICT tools, software, and online platforms. Regarding the ways through which librarians acquired the ICT skills and knowledge they had, the study reveals diverse sources. To effectively practice embedded librarianship, the study recommends both long-term and short-term ICT training for library professionals. ©, Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. ©, Carren Mushi, Kelefa Mwantimwa, and Evans Wema.","academic library;

This paper aims to examine the emergence of robotic technologies with its implications to academic libraries in Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach: The research, which was conducted on a desk, examined how the adoption of robotic technologies may affect library services and operations. Findings: It is believed that robot adoption in libraries can enhance library services and give users with reliable information that can foster growth and development in the information age. Originality/value: This paper is the original idea from the authors and does not reflect on any copyrighted materials. The paper recommended that academic libraries should collaborate with their parent institutions or organisations to create a strategy plan for cutting-edge technology, such as robots; federal and state governments should strengthen their alliances with robot vendors to take advantage of direct support; and open communication between library management boards and librarians should be encouraged, particularly when it comes to the acceptance and use of robots in libraries. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Academic libraries; Artificial intelligence; Librarianship; Nigeria; Robots; Technology","","","","","","","","Ali M.S., Bots in Libraries: They’re Coming for Your Jobs (or Is It?), (2019); Blut M., Wang C., Wunderlich N.V., Brock C., Understanding anthropomorphism in service provision: a meta-analysis of physical robots, chat bots, and other AI, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 49, 4, pp. 632-658, (2021); Cotera M., We embrace digital innovation: IE University Library reinventing higher education, 4th Lebanese Library Association Conference “Innovative Libraries: Paths to the future”, in collaboration with IFLA Asia Oceania Section, May 9‐11, (2018); Cox A., The impact of AI, machine learning, automation and robotics on the information professions: a report for CILIP, (2021); Das R.K., Islam M.S.U., Application of artificial intelligence and machine learning in libraries: a systematic review, (2021); Decker E., The Role of Robotic Telepresence in the Academic Library, pp. 6648-6655, (2015); Echedom A.U., Okuonghae O., Transforming academic library operations in Africa with artificial intelligence: opportunities and challenges: a review paper, New Review of Academic Librarianship, 27, 2, pp. 243-255, (2021); El Kadiri S., Grabot B., Thoben K.D., Hribernik K., Emmanouilidis C., Von Cieminski G., Kiritsis D., Current trends on ICT technologies for enterprise information systems, Computers in Industry, 79, pp. 14-33, (2016); Harisanty D., Anna N.E.V., Putri T.E., Firdaus A.A., Designing ‘library smart bot’ to support information services in academic library, Journal of Southwest Jiaotong University, 55, 6, (2020); Kim B., AI-powered robots for libraries: exploratory questions: information technology satellite meeting, (2017); Korinek A., Stiglitz J., Artificial intelligence and its implications for income distribution and unemployment, (2017); Martinez-Plumed F., Gomez E., Hernandez-Orallo J., Futures of artificial intelligence through technology readiness levels, Telematics and Informatics, 58, 12, pp. 12-21, (2021); Nguyen L.C., The impact of humanoid robots on Australian public libraries, Journal of the Australian Library and Information Association, 69, 2, pp. 130-148, (2020); Norwin S., AI, robot and library: a new dimension in LIS, (2020); Okpokwasili-Nonyelum P., Artificial intelligence in libraries and user satisfaction in higher institutions in Nigeria, International Journal of Research in Informative Science Application & Techniques (IJRISAT), 3, 2, pp. 2581-5814, (2019); Owolabi K.A., Okorie N.C., Yemi-Peters O.E., Oyetola S.O., Bello T.O., Oladokun B.D., Readiness of academic librarians towards the use of robotic technologies in Nigerian university libraries, Library Management, 43, 3-4, pp. 296-305, (2022); Qomariyah A., Mursidah G., Wahyun D., Analysis of organizational readiness towards library 4.0: a case study at x library, Record and Library Journal, 6, 2, pp. 1-23, (2020); Schreur P.E., The use of linked data and artificial intelligence as key elements in the transformation of technical services, Cataloging & Classification Quarterly, 58, 5, pp. 473-485, (2020); Tay B., Jung Y., Park T., When stereotypes meet robots: the double-edge sword of robot gender and personality in human-robot interaction, Computers in Human Behaviour, 38, pp. 75-84, (2014); Tella A., Robots are coming to the libraries: are librarians ready to accommodate them, Library Hi Tech News, 37, 8, pp. 13-17, (2020); Villani V., Pini F., Leali F., Secchi C., Survey on human-robot collaboration in industrial settings: safety, intuitive interfaces and applications, Mechatronics, 55, pp. 248-266, (2018); Wang Z., This work is made available under the terms of the creative commons attribution 4.0 international license, (2014); World Development Report: Digital Dividends, (2016); Yusuf T.I., Adebayo O.A., Bello L.A., Kayode J.O., Adoption of artificial intelligence for effective library service delivery in academic libraries in Nigeria, Library Philosophy and Practice (e-Journal), (2022)","B.D.

Similarly, we must be prepared to teach our students how to cope in this knowledge society and how to develop the necessary information and digital literacy skills to be productive members of society in a digital environment. This article explores the first eighteen months of our experience as digital curriculum librarians in a large project at the University of South Australia (UniSA), UniSA Online. We have taken this opportunity to critically reflect on being embedded librarians within such a strategic and unique project. We examine the key cultural, pedagogical and technological challenges we have faced in delivering resources, support and services to the project team. The solutions we have adopted to overcome these challenges within an intensive course development environment are also outlined. The importance of building good relationships both within the project team, academics and with other library staff to deliver positive outcomes is discussed. We examine the pedagogical imperatives we have followed and the technological challenges we have faced to provide an active learning experience for our students in a digital learning environment. Our role as digital curriculum librarians is still evolving, however, we can observe some emerging trends within academic librarianship and comment on them, as we believe that the imperatives of the knowledge society will only become more prevalent into the future. We conclude by outlining which professional skills we need as academic librarians to evolve our roles and be successful in the digital world. © 2019, University of Wollongong.

This study focuses on the importance of library management systems and the need for the graduates to be equipped with analytics skills. Combined with basic data, text mining and analytics, knowledge classification and information audit skills would benefit libraries and improve resource allocation. Agile institutional libraries in this big data era success hinge on the ability to perform depth analytics of both data and text to generate useful insight for information literacy training and information governance. Design/methodology/approach: This paper adopted a living-lab methodology to use existing technology to conduct system analysis and LMS audit of an academic library of one of the highly ranked universities in the world. One of the benefits of this approach is the ability to apply technological innovation and tools to carry out research that is relevant to the context of LIS or other research fields such as management, education, humanities and social sciences. The techniques allow us to gain access to publicly available information because of system audits that were performed. The level of responsiveness of the online library was accessed, and basic information audits were conducted. Findings: This study indicated skill gaps in the LIS training and the academic libraries in response to the fourth industrial technologies. This study argued that the role of skill acquisition and how it can foster data-driven library management operations. Hence, data mining, text mining and analytics are needed to probe into such massive, big data housed in the various libraries’ repositories. This study, however, indicated that without retraining of librarians or including this analytics programming in the LIS curriculum, the libraries would not be able to reap the benefits these techniques provided. Research limitations/implications: This paper covered research within the general and academic libraries and the broader LIS fields. The same principle and concept is very important for both public and private libraries with substantial usage and patrons. Practical implications: This paper indicated that librarianship training must fill the gaps within the LIS training. This can be done by including data mining, data analytics, text mining and processing in the curriculum. This skill will enable the news graduates to have skills to assist the library managers in making informed decisions based on user-generated content (UGC), LMS system audits and information audits. Thus, this paper provided practical insights and suggested solutions for academic libraries to improve the agility of information services. Social implications: The academic librarian can improve institutional and LMS management through insights that are generated from the user. This study indicated that libraries' UGC could serve as robust insights into library management. Originality/value: This paper argued that the librarian expertise transcends information literacy and knowledge classification and debated the interwoven of LMS and data analytics, text mining and analysis as a solution to improve efficient resources and training. © 2022, Patrick Ajibade and Ndakasharwa Muchaonyerwa.","Data analytics;

This paper examines the potential application and implications of artificial intelligence for contemporary library services in Nigeria. Methods: this paper adopts the expository research approach to evaluate the application and implication of artificial intelligence in contemporary library services in Nigeria. Through systematic analysis of literature, the study addresses how academic libraries can utilize artificial intelligence to support innovative library services. Findings: the column emphasizes that, academic libraries in Nigeria have not yet adopted and applied AI, in spite of the potential that it holds for libraries. Given that there has been relatively little study linking artificial intelligence (AI) to librarianship, this may be because there is a low degree of awareness and adoption of AI’s importance in libraries. Conclusions: this column is the original idea from the authors and does not reflect on any copyrighted materials. The column recommended that, academic libraries in Nigeria should fully embrace artificial intelligence like chatbots, barcodes, RFIDs, and robots for delivering quality services and libraries should also leverage on the opportunities presented by artificial intelligence to reconnect their remote users, and consequently re-establish their relevance among the user community. © Este es un artículo en acceso abierto.","Academic Libraries; Artificial Intelligence; Library Services; Machine Learning; Nigeria; Robotics; Technology","","","","","","","","Owolabi KA, Okorie NC, Yemi-Peters OE, Oyetola SO, Bello TO, Oladokun BD., Readiness of academic librarians towards the use of robotic technologies in Nigerian university libraries, Library Management, 43, pp. 296-305, (2022); Park S-C., The Fourth Industrial Revolution and implications for innovative cluster policies, AI & Soc, 33, pp. 433-445, (2018); Research report: The impact of AI, machine learning, automation and robotics on the information professions, (2021); Fadel C, Holmes W, Bialik M., Artificial intelligence in education: Promises and implications for teaching and learning, (2019); Libris E., Artificial Intelligence in the Library: Advantages, Challenges and Tradition, An Ex Libris Whitepaper, (2018); Tella A., Robots are coming to the libraries: are librarians ready to accommodate them?, Library Hi Tech News, 37, pp. 13-17, (2020); YUSUF T, ADEBAYO O, BELLO L, KAYODE J., Adoption of Artificial Intelligence for Effective Library Service Delivery in Academic Libraries in Nigeria, Library Philosophy and Practice (e-journal), (2022); Cox A., The impact of AI, machine learning, automation and robotics on the information professions: A report for CILIP 2021; McCaffrey C., 14-Planning and implementing an automated storage and retrieval system at the University of Limerick, Technology, Change and the Academic Library, pp. 143-150, (2021); Hopkins P, Maccabee R., Chatbots and digital assistants–Getting started in FE and HE, (2018); Mckie IAS, Narayan B., Enhancing the Academic Library Experience with Chatbots: An Exploration of Research and Implications for Practice, Journal of the Australian Library and Information Association, 68, pp. 268-277, (2019); Cordell R., Machine learning+ libraries: A report on the state of the field, Library of Congress, (2020); Nguyen LC., The Impact of Humanoid Robots on Australian Public Libraries, Journal of the Australian Library and Information Association, 69, pp. 130-148, (2020); Echedom AU, Okuonghae O., Transforming academic library operations in Africa with artificial intelligence: Opportunities and challenges: A review paper, New Review of Academic Librarianship, 27, (2021); Garoufallou E, Gaitanou P., Big Data: Opportunities and Challenges in Libraries, a Systematic Literature Review, College & Research Libraries, (2021); Olusegun Solomon, Oladokun BD, Maxwell CE, Akor SO., Artificial Intelligence in the Library: Potential Implications to Library and Information Services in the 21St Century Nigeria 2023; Korinek A, Stiglitz JE., Artificial intelligence and its implications for income distribution and unemployment, The economics of artificial intelligence: An agenda, (2018); World Development Report: Digital dividends, (2016)","","","Editorial Salud, Ciencia y Tecnologia","","","","","","29534917","","","","English","Data.

The paper provides a bibliography of scientific and professional papers of Croatian authors on the education of information professionals in three branches of information and communication sciences: archives and documentation, librarianship, and museology. The aim of the paper is to provide quantitative and qualitative insights into Croatian scientific and professional production in the mentioned areas and to indicate its importance in the establishment of the field of information sciences in Croatia. Methodology. In order to find the relevant papers on the subject the following sources have been searched: the Croatian Scientific Bibliography, Hrčak-Portal of Sci-entific Journals of the Republic of Croatia, the catalog of the National and University Library of Zagreb, the bibliographic, citation and full text databases in the field of social sciences available through the Electronic Source Portal for the Croatian Academic and Scientific Community, and finally the Google Scholar search engine. In an effort to keep the bibliography as complete as possible, the lists of literature in the identified works were also searched, and for this reason, the bibliography can be considered to be made de visu. The collected bibliography entries were analyzed from the quantitative and qualitative perspectives as well as by the authorship, types of papers, and language. Findings. The quantitative analysis showed that the first papers appeared in the ear-ly 1950s, and that even then much thought was given to the education of information professionals. This interest intensified in the mid-1980s and has not faded since then, but rather has grown. The largest number of papers appeared in the first decade of the 21st century. The reasons should probably be found not only in the rapid development of information and communication technologies but also in the introduction of the Bologna process into the Croatian higher education institutions, and the consequent adaptations and changes that had to be made in the curriculum and education of information profes-sionals. The qualitative analysis has shown that a large number of papers were devoted to this topic. More than half of the papers were co-authored by two or more authors, which indicates good professional cooperation between the members of the Croatian professional and scientific community dealing with the issues of education of information professionals. The fact that a relatively large number of papers was presented at foreign conferences, and that a significant number of papers was written in English, indicate the importance of the contribution of Croatian authors to the understanding of this issue at the global level. Originality/value. The thematic bibliography of this type has not been made before. The paper is also a stimulus for a new generation of scientists and experts to further explore the topic of education of information professionals who should constantly work on their professional development and learn how to adapt to new information and communication technologies. © 2020, Hrvatsko Knjiznicarsko Drustvo.

More specifically, this paper reflects the perceptions of Greek academic librarians regarding the use of learning management systems (LMSs). Furthermore, it seeks to highlight the most popular software, to list the services provided through LMSs and to determine the level of librarians’ engagement with LMSs. Finally, it investigates the challenges and benefits of their use. Design/methodology/approach: Survey research was used as the methodological design. An adequate questionnaire was created for the collection of quantitative data to study the activities and experiences of academic embedded librarians. Findings: According to the study findings, a considerable percentage of academic librarians use the potential of LMSs, indicating that embedded librarianship is the future for Greek academic libraries. However, it seems that LMSs are not fully exploited even during the pandemic when the libraries remained closed. Research limitations/implications: This study was exploratory in nature and thus its scope was limited. It was limited to embedded librarianship in academic libraries. Practical implications: Embedded librarianship comes with many challenges for its practitioners; yet, it also has the potential to connect libraries and librarians directly to the overall institutional aims and enhance their positions in the academy. Originality/value: The role and participation of embedded librarians in Greek academic institutions is a research area that has not been fully investigated. Therefore, this paper can give insights into this critical issue, especially during a pandemic. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Academic libraries; Distance education; E-learning; Educational technology; Embedded librarian; Information literacy; Learning management systems","","","","","","","","Almeida N., Pollack J., In bed with the library: a critical exploration of embedded librarianship at the City University of New York, Communications in Information Literacy, 11, 1, pp. 122-146, (2017); Burke J., Tumbleson B., A Declaration of Embeddedness: Instructional Synergies and Sustaining Practices in LMS Embedded Librarianship, (2011); Burke J., Tumbleson B., Mentoring in academic libraries, Library Leadership and Management, 33, 4, pp. 1-19, (2019); Ciccone A., Hounslow L., Re-envisioning the role of academic librarians for the digital learning environment: the case of UniSA, Journal of University Teaching and Learning Practice, 16, 1-1, (2019); Drewes K., Hoffman N., Academic embedded librarianship: an introduction, Public Services Quarterly, 6, 2-3, pp. 75-82, (2010); Edwards Mu., Kumar S., Ochoa M., Assessing the value of embedded librarians in an online graduate educational technology course, Public Services Quarterly, 6, 2-3, pp. 271-291, (2010); Finley P., MacMillan M., Skarl S., Bowler M., Street K., Investigating the efficacy of embedment: experiments in information literacy integration, Reference Services Review, 36, 4, pp. 438-449, (2008); Harkness S.J., Rusk F.A., Rubio R., Using an embedded librarian model to increase information literacy in political science research methods, Journal of Political Science Education, 17, 3, pp. 385-405, (2019); Jacobs W.N., Embedded librarianship is a winning proposition, Education Libraries, 33, 2, pp. 3-10, (2010); Kesselman M.A., Watstein S.B., Creating opportunities: embedded librarians, Journal of Library Administration, 49, 4, pp. 383-400, (2009); Kvenild C., Tumbleson B.E., Burke J.J., Calkins K., Embedded librarianship: questions and answers from librarians in the trenches, Library Hi Tech News, 2, pp. 8-11, (2016); Makhafola L., Van Deventer M.J., Selecting information products and services to embed in a virtual learning environment to support engineering undergraduates in a blended learning context, Library Management, 41, 6-7, pp. 579-591, (2020); O'Toole E., Barham R., Monahan J., The impact of physically embedded librarianship on academic departments, Libraries and the Academy, 16, 3, pp. 529-556, (2016); Paganelli Alpha., Paganelli A., The online embedded personal librarian approach to providing reference services via a course management system, Journal of Electronic Resources Librarianship, 29, 1, pp. 54-60, (2017); Shumaker D., Talley M., Models of Embedded Librarianship: Final Report, (2009); Spangler S., Integrating information literacy in IT courses: information technology students’ perceptions of embedded librarians, Journal of Applied Knowledge Management, 7, 2, pp. 29-40, (2019); Steele J.E., The role of the academic librarian in online courses: a case study, The Journal of Academic Librarianship, 47, pp. 1-7, (2021); Strasz M., Best practices for embedded librarian service: Connecting with students online, C&RL News, pp. 85-86, (2021); Summey T.P., Kane C.A., Going where they are: intentionally embedding librarians in courses and measuring the impact on student learning, Journal of Library and Information Services in Distance Learning, 11, 1-2, pp. 1-17, (2017); Tumbleson B., Burke J., Long J., Assessment, analytics, and analysis: demonstrating the impact of LMS embedded librarians on student learning, Journal of Library and Information Services in Distance Learning, 13, 1-2, pp. 196-214, (2019); Withorn T., Eslami J., Lee H., Clarke M., Gardner C.C., Springfield C., Ospina D., Andora A., Castaneda A., Mitchell A., Kimmitt J.M., Vermeer W., Haas A., Library instruction and information literacy 2020, Reference Services Review, 49, 3-4, pp. 329-418, (2021); York A.C., Vance J.M., Taking library instruction into the online classroom: best practices for embedded librarians, Journal of Library Administration, 49, 1-2, pp. 197-209, (2009); Zanin-Yost A., Academic collaborations: linking the role of the liaison/embedded librarian to teaching and learning, College and Undergraduate Libraries, 25, 2, pp. 150-163, (2018)","K.

Design/Methodology/Approach: This is a qualitative study of a descriptive-evaluative approach. Documentary analysis was employed as a method by which a systematic review was performed. Available data coming from web portals of the schools and programs of the country, and of the Scienti platform from Colciencias (the governing body of research in Colombia) were also analyzed. Results/Discussion: The results evidenced the significant advance of the research in archival science, librarianship, and information science in Colombia, the thematic and methodological variety, due to the nature, curricular orientation and academic strength of each school and/or program. These advances support the generation of knowledge with social and scientific relevance, postgraduate training and the existence of journals with positions in the international scientific community, all aligned with the public policies of science, technology and innovation. Conclusions: The development and evolution of research in archival science, librarianship, and information science in Colombia is part of a formal structure present in universities that provide training in this field. Originality/Value: The existing studies on research in archival science, librarianship, and information science in Colombia have been developed by higher education institutions, which show somewhat partial visions. Therefore, it has been necessary a study that provided an overview of the country towards the concrete actions that make visible the scientific research in the field. © 2019 Biblioteca Nacional de Cuba Jose Marti.

The new structure makes provision for the delivery of new and innovative services responding to the need for a paradigm shift in twenty-first century academic librarianship. The move away from subject librarianship, which has been the bastion of South African academic librarianship, is significant. Design/methodology/approach: This paper used the exploratory method to gain new insights into library structures that have restructured for the twenty-first century. The exploratory study was used to gain new insights into functional librarianship. Despite the short comings of the exploratory method, the method was deemed most appropriate as UCT Libraries was not seeking definitive answers but a process that would provide opportunities to explore possibilities for subsequent processes. Findings: The move from subject librarianship to functional librarianship has given the library the opportunity to restructure. The restructured library can now offer new and/or radically expanded services to meet the demands of a twenty-first century academic library. Practical implications: The development of new and future roles and responsibilities commensurate with a robust and “future-driven” structure will consolidate the library’s role as a collaborator in the teaching and learning, and research agendas of a higher education institution. Originality/value: This paper will be of interest and value to library managers and staff wanting to develop a library structure that responds positively to the redefinition of the professional roles and functions of the library and to strategically position the academic library for the future. It will also be of interest to library and information science academics who may want to re-examine their curricula for the incorporation of new trends. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Clinical librarianship; Functional librarianship; Library as publisher; Library restructuring; Scholarly communication; Subject librarianship","","","","","","","","2010 top ten trends in academic libraries: a review of the current literature, College and Research Libraries News, 71, June, pp. 286-292, (2010); Babbie E., The Practice of Social Research, (2013); Cooke L., Norris M., Busby N., Page T., Franklin G., Gadd E., Young H., Evaluating the impact of academic liaison librarians on their user community: a review and case study, New Review of Academic Librarianship, 17, 1, pp. 5-30, (2011); Corrall S., Designing libraries for research collaboration in the network world: an exploratory study, Liber Quarterly, 24, 1, pp. 17-48, (2014); Delaney G., Bates J., Envisioning the academic library: a reflection on roles, relevancy and relationships, New Review of Academic Librarianship, 21, 1, pp. 30-51, (2015); Ellis E., Rosenblum B., Stratton J., Ames-Stratton K., Positioning academic libraries for the future: a process and strategy for organizational transformation, Proceedings of the IATUL Conferences, (2014); Fouche C., De Vos A., Formal formulations, Research at Grass Roots, pp. 89-100, (2012); Giesecke J., Finding the right metaphor: restructuring, realigning, and repackaging today’s research libraries, pp. 54-65, (2011); Giuse N., Koonce T., Jerome R., Cahall M., Sathe N., Williams A., Evolution of a mature clinical informationist model, Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, 12, 3, pp. 249-255, (2005); Hoodless C., Pinfield S., Subject vs functional: should subject librarians be replaced by functional specialists in academic libraries?, Journal of Librarianship and Information Science, pp. 1-16, (2016); Jantz R., Innovation in academic libraries: an analysis of university librarians’ perspectives, Library and Information Science Research, 34, pp. 3-12, (2012); Johnson G., A study of the knowledge and skills requirements for the humanities librarian in supporting postgraduate students, (2016); Keller A., Research support in Australian university libraries: an outsider view, Australian Academic & Research Libraries, 46, 2, pp. 73-85, (2015); Restructuring Action Plan Queen’s University Library, (2010); Lipscomb C., Clinical librarianship, Bulletin of the Medical Library Association, 88, 4, pp. 393-396, (2000); Monroe-Gulick A., O'Brien M., White G., Librarians as partners: moving from research supporters to research partners, Association of College and Research Libraries Conference Proceedings, pp. 382-387, (2013); Mutula S., The changing face of library and information science profession, African Journal of Libraries, Archives and Information Science, 23, 2, pp. 89-92, (2013); Ocholla L., Mutsvunguma G., Hadebe Z., The impact of new information services on teaching, learning and research at the University of Zululand Library, South African Journal of Libraries and Information Science, 82, 2, (2017); Raju R., Schoombee L., Research support through the lens of transformation in academic libraries with reference to the case of Stellenbosch university libraries, South African Journal of Libraries and Information Science, 79, 2, (2014); Raju R., Raju J., Johnson G., Research support services in South African academic libraries, Quality and the Academic Library: Reviewing Assessing and Enhancing Service Provision, pp. 167-177, (2016); Reskilling for research: an investigation into the role and skills of subject and liaison librarians required to effectively support the evolving information needs of researchers, (2012); Robson C., Real World Research: A Resource for Social Scientists and Practitioner Researches, (2002); Roper T., The impact of the clinical librarian: a review, Journal of the European Association for Health Information and Libraries, 11, 4, pp. 19-22, (2015); Schwartz C., Restructuring academic libraries: adjusting to technological change; Sputore A., Humphries P., Steiner N., Sustainable academic libraries in Australia: exploring ‘radical collaborations’ and implications for reference services, (2015); ten Ham-Baloyi W., Jordan P., Systematic review as a research method in postgraduate nursing education, Health SA Gesondheid, 21, pp. 120-128, (2016); Tenopir C., Sandusky R.J., Allard S., Birch B., Research data management services in academic research libraries and perceptions of librarians, Library and Information Science Research, 36, pp. 84-90, (2014); Tise E., Raju R., Adam A., From research support to research partners, The Quest for Deeper Meaning of Research Support, (2015); Winning M., Beverley C., Clinical librarianship: a systematic review of the literature, Health Information and Libraries Journal, 20, S1, pp. 10-21, (2003)","R.

ChatGPT is a large language model (LLM) and a subset of machine learning that can identify, condense, translate, predict, and produce text. The large language model (LLM), sometimes called “autocomplete on steroids,” has drawn attention for its ability to present human-like answers to queries. Its work has received passing grades on university law and business exams and has been used in a Colombian court to help decide a legal ruling. Academia has expressed concern as to AI’s potential to undermine the education system or contribute to academic dishonesty if students use the technology in place of their thoughts, opinions, and research. Moreover, journal editors, researchers, and publishers are now debating the place of such AI tools in the published literature and whether it’s appropriate to cite the bot as an author. This chapter explores ChatGPT and its impact on librarianship, academia, scholarly research, the workplace, and other entities. © 2023 by IGI Global.

To examine the current landscape of data reference, we distributed a survey via regional and international library listservs asking librarians about their experiences and opinions related to their data reference work. For this paper, the full collected dataset was limited to only academic librarians who answer at least one data reference question per month in order to identify the unique needs of respondents doing reference work in academic institutions, with the ultimate goal of improving our own work as academic librarians at our institution. We used a grounded theory approach to analyze the qualitative survey response data, and supplemented this analysis with descriptive statistics and chi-square tests for the quantitative responses. Through this analysis, we identify a theoretical framework consisting of three themes relating to limitations to success where librarians must advocate for change in order to maintain and improve high-quality data reference work in the academic sphere: (1) technology and resource limitations, such as substandard database interfaces; (2) institutional limitations, such as insufficient staff time or resources dedicated to data reference; and (3) personal limitations, such as a lack of data skills. While librarians have varying levels of influence over each of these three areas, identifying and targeting these categories can help librarians and other data professionals focus resources and build cases for additional support from their library and campus administrators. © The Author(s) 2021.","Academic libraries; data librarianship; data reference services; grounded theory; library research support","","","","","","","","Bauder J., The Reference Guide to Data Sources, (2014); Bordelon B., Databrarianship: The Academic Data Librarian in Theory and Practice, pp. 35-49, (2016); Geraci D., Humphrey C., Jacobs J., Data basics: An introductory text, (2012); Glaser B.G., Strauss A.L., The Discovery of Grounded Theory: Strategies for Qualitative Research, (1967); Hoffman S., Data reference and instruction in journalism and the social sciences, DttP: A Quarterly Journal of Government Information Practice & Perspective, 43, 2, pp. 14-17, (2015); Kellam L.M., Peter K., Numeric Data Services and Sources for the General Reference Librarian, (2011); Kubas A., McBurney J., Frustrations and roadblocks in data reference librarianship, IASSIST Quarterly, 43, 1, pp. 1-18, (2019); McBurney J., Kubas A., Recoding the academic librarian: Our developing role as data detectives, pp. 493-506, (2019); McCaffrey M., Giesbrecht W., Teaching data librarianship to LIS students, Databrarianship: The Academic Data Librarian in Theory and Practice, pp. 355-371, (2016); Rice R., Southall J., The Data Librarian’s Handbook, (2016); Smith M., Conte J., Guss S., Understanding academic patrons’ data needs through virtual reference transcripts: Preliminary findings from New York University Libraries, IASSIST Quarterly, 40, 1, pp. 20-26, (2016); Strauss A.L., Corbin J.M., Basics of Qualitative Research: Techniques and Procedures for Developing Grounded Theory, (1998); Swygart-Hobaugh A.J., Data services in academic libraries—What strange beast is this?, SLIS Student Research Journal, 6, 2, pp. 7-12, (2017)","A.

Various types of library services are examined in terms of funding, acquisition and technical equipment support issues. Also, different subordination conditions (public/private) of the universities help to better understand the current position of academic libraries in different entities. Design/methodology/approach: Most part of the conveyed information was obtained through review of related literature, libraries’ annual reports and personal communication with the directors of the academic libraries, to look for similarities and differences in provided library and information services. The results of the study are comparatively described through multiple tables and charts. Findings: For improving services it is necessary to develop paid forms of library and information services, maintain various training possibilities for library staff in modern librarianship areas, increase the variety and number of public and outreach activities. Research limitations/implications: As the findings of the paper suggest new forms of library services and activities, it is necessary to continue the topic in further studies to develop practical methods and applications for local library conditions. Originality/value: The paper can be accepted as the first comparative study of the library information services in academic libraries of Azerbaijan, which gives general overview and analysis of separate service ranges and types. The researchers interested in Azerbaijani librarianship may find it practical. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Academic library; Library information services; Library technologies; Service ranges; User categories; User specification","","","","","","","","(2018); (2018); (2018); (2018); (2017); (2016); (2018); Bakı: M.F.Axundzadə adına Milli Kitabxana, (2015); (2018); (2018); Bell S.J., Shank J.D., Academic Librarianship by Design: A Blended Librarian’s Guide to the Tools and Techniques, (2007); Drake M.A., Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science: First Update Supplement, (2005); (2017); Gannon-Leary P., McCarthy M.D., Customer Care: A Training Manual for Library Staff, (2010); (2018); Hornung E., Continuing professional development, How to Thrive as a Solo Librarian, pp. 127-136, (2012); (2017); (2017); (1998); Kuzmin E., Report on Azerbaijan libraries, (2008); Lankes R.D., The Atlas of New Librarianship, (2011); Lewis D.W., Reimagining the Academic Library, (2016); Lugg R., Collecting for the moment: patron-driven acquisitions as a disruptive technology, Patron-Driven Acquisitions: History and Best Practices, pp. 7-22, (2011); McAdoo M.L., Building Bridges: Connecting Faculty, Students, and the College Library, (2010); Mammadova V.M., Library information services provided to external users at the ADA University Library, 5, 132, pp. 120-123, (2018); Memmedova V., Akademik kitabxanalarda müasir informasiya fəaliyyətinin təşkili: ADA Universiteti Kitabxanasının iş təcrübəsi əsasında, (2016); Memmedova V., Müasir akademik kitabxana-informasiya xidmətinin təşkili metodikası: ADA Universiteti Kitabxanasının iş təcrübəsi əsasında, Kitabxanaşünaslıq və Biblioqrafiya, 2, 39, pp. 46-54, (2016); Memmedova V., Müasir Azərbaycan mühitində akademik və elmi tədqiqatın informasiya təminatında ADA Universiteti Kitabxanasının rolu, Kitabxanaşünaslıq və Biblioqrafiya, 1, 40, pp. 121-136, (2017); Mitchell E., Seiden P., Reviewing the Academic Library: A Guide to Self-Study and External Review, (2015); Mullen L.B., Open Access and its Practical Impact on the Work of Academic Librarians, (2010); (2018); Pendse L.R., Goyushov A., Libraries of Azerbaijan today, Libraries in the Early 21st Century: An International Perspective, pp. 63-89, (2012); (2018); (2017); Steiner R., Berry R., Building new libraries on the international stage: the near and Middle East, Patron-Driven Acquisitions: History and Best Practices, pp. 79-94, (2011); Virkus S., Academic libraries in Eastern Europe, Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science, pp. 11-21, (2005)","V.

By compiling and analyzing data from 85 libraries, this study seeks to facilitate comparisons between current and past accessibility practice and to provide perspective on how libraries communicate to users about accessibility efforts across libraries. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted a content analysis of 85 library accessibility pages from a sample population of 98 institutions, consisting of all members institutions of four US academic library consortia. Pages were coded for content elements regarding services, facilities, collections, staffing, assistive technologies and general information. Webpage features, architecture and accessibility/functionality were also assessed. Findings: Libraries have broadened and strengthened efforts to publicize/provide services and resources to functionally diverse users. Pages most commonly prioritize information about assistive technologies, services and facilities. Pages varied greatly in size, complexity and detail, but public institutions' pages were more prevalent and informative than their private counterparts. Libraries can work to foreground accessibility pages and increase transparency and evidence of currency to improve communication to their users. Originality/value: This study provides a large-scale content analysis of library accessibility webpages. It allows for comparison of the features and information most commonly featured on these important online points of service. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Accessibility; ADA; Consortia; Content analysis; Disability; Library websites; Policy","","","","","","","","Library services for people with disabilities policy, (2001); Brunskill A., ‘Without that detail, I'm not coming’: the perspectives of students with disabilities on accessibility information provided on academic library websites, College and Research Libraries, 81, 5, pp. 768-788, (2020); Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, Definitions and methods, (2021); Cassner M., Maxey-Harris C., Anaya T., Differently able: a review of academic library websites for people with disabilities, Behavioral and Social Sciences Librarian, 30, 1, pp. 33-51, (2011); DeCandido G.A., ARL SPEC Kit 243: Service to Users with Disabilities, (1999); Graves S.J., German E., Evidence of our values: disability inclusion on library instruction websites, Portal: Libraries and the Academy, 18, 3, pp. 559-574, (2018); Hayes A.F., Krippendorff K., Answering the call for a standard reliability measure for coding data, Communication Methods and Measures, 1, 1, pp. 77-89, (2007); Kimura A.K., Defining, evaluating, and achieving accessible library resources: a review of theories and methods, Reference Services Review, 46, 3, pp. 425-438, (2018); Krippendorff K., Content Analysis: an Introduction to its Methodology, (2004); Kumbier A., Starkey J., Access is not problem solving: disability justice and libraries, Library Trends, 64, 3, pp. 468-491, (2016); Who we are, (2021); Pionke J.J., Beyond ADA compliance: the library as a place for all, Urban Library Journal, 23, 1, (2017); Pionke J.J., Toward holistic accessibility: narratives from functionally diverse patrons, Reference and User Services Quarterly, 57, 1, pp. 48-56, (2017); Power R., LeBeau C., How well do academic library web sites address the needs of database users with visual disabilities?, The Reference Librarian, 50, 1, pp. 50-72, (2009); Shakespeare T., Disability Rights and Wrongs, (2006); Spina C., Cohen M., ARL SPEC Kit 358: Accessibility and Universal Design, (2018); Vaughan K.T.L., Warlick S.E., Accessibility and disability services in Virginia's four-year academic libraries: a content analysis of library webpages, Virginia Libraries, 64, 1, pp. 1-7, (2020); Hill H., Disability and accessibility in the library and information science literature: a content analysis, Library and Information Science Research, 35, 2, pp. 137-142, (2013)","J.

Although there were studies on IDBE in libraries in general, the authors of this study were particularly interested in what Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics and Medicine (STEMM) librarians were facing or not facing regarding IDBE. We were unable to locate any known study focusing on STEMM librarians' lived experiences regarding IDBE. Thus, our study aimed to explore this area further. A survey consisting of multiple-choice, Likert and short-answer questions was sent to STEMM librarians via specific listservs. In this study, we use a grounded theory approach and analyze three of the questions in the survey. This study would particularly interest librarians who would like to ascertain the climate of IDBE and the intersection with social justice in STEMM Librarianship. Also, we provide strategies to improve the climate and provide a more inclusive, diverse, equitable and belonging environment for STEMM Librarians. Our data analysis shows that STEMM librarians who identify as People of Color encounter negative behaviors, experiences, and attitudes at a much higher rate than STEMM librarians who are white. In addition, many STEMM librarians who identify as white report white privilege awareness. © 2024, Association of College and Research Libraries.

This paper aims to examine the emergence of social media technologies (SMTs) with their implications to academic library services in developing countries in the world. It is believed that a growing number of libraries of all types are starting to use SMTs to enhance their service delivery, similar to other institutions. Design/methodology/approach: The research, which was conducted on a desk, examined how the implementation of SMTs may affect library services and operations. The study emphasizes that many academic libraries in developing countries have not yet adopted and implemented SMTs despite the potential that they hold for libraries. Findings: Given that there has been relatively little study linking SMTs to librarianship, this may be because there is a low degree of awareness of SMTs’ importance in libraries. This study discovered that there are other types of SMTs relevant to academic libraries including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Blog among others. This paper reported the implications of SMTs to library services in developing countries. Originality/value: This study is the original idea from the authors and does not reflect on any copyrighted materials. The study recommended among others that sufficient training and more expertise need to be gained by academic libraries to further facilitate implementation of social networks in the libraries, and adoption of contemporary media technologies such as social media in meeting the needs of the 21st-century library patrons should be prioritized. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Academic libraries; Information and communication technologies; Library services; Patrons; Social media; Technologies","","","","","","","","Chaffey D., Global social media research summary, Smart Insight, 3, 1, pp. 45-95, (2019); Chi D.T.P., Developing the use of social media in libraries, International Journal of Library and Information Studies, 10, 2, pp. 2231-4911, (2020); Chitumbo E.M.M., Chewe P., Social media tools for library service delivery in higher learning institutions: case of University of Zambia and National Institute of Public Administration libraries, Research Journal of Library Sciences, 3, 5, pp. 1-7, (2015); Ezeani C.N., Igwesi U., Using social media for dynamic library service delivery: the Nigeria experience, (2016); Khan A.M., Social media can be fruitful for the libraries in the future generation.

But its adoption especially in African countries and academic libraries is still at the nascent stage. This study aims to find the contributing determinants of cloud computing adoption in North-Eastern Nigerian academic libraries using Technological and Organizational variables of Technology-Organization-Environment theory(TOE) and Diffusion of Innovation Theory (DOI). A quantitative approach using a survey research design was employed. Seventy-eight academic libraries in North-Eastern Nigeria formed the population of the study and census enumeration is used which indicates that all the academic libraries are considered. Results revealed that five out of six determinants are significant for the adoption of cloud computing in academic libraries. While moderation effect results revealed that only one determinant is moderated by the adopted moderator. This implies that the significant determinants should be given more consideration when deciding to adopt cloud computing. Equally, the study’s results will guide academic libraries’ decision-makers that include the Chief Librarian, Deputy Librarian and Head of ICT unit who are responsible for deciding on the rejection or accepting innovative technology in the library to make fruitful and realistic decisions when deciding to adopt cloud computing. Theoretically, the results will contribute to the body of knowledge especially in the librarianship field. Finally, the study recommends among others that special attention should be given to those significant determinants when deciding to adopt cloud computing in academic libraries. Future studies should employ more variables and use another factor as a moderator. Equally future studies should cover more areas beyond North-Eastern Nigeria. © The Author(s) 2024.","Academic libraries; cloud computing; cloud determinants; decision-makers; library services delivery;

It explores the PO role at the intersections of functional specialization, public services, and technical services, as well as from critical perspectives on gendered labor in librarianship. By examining how our library used the PO model to address pressing problems with our library’s institutional repository (IR), we demonstrate the value that the PO approach can bring to improving library products, especially when the PO is appropriately positioned to advocate for user needs. We also interrogate the overlap in responsibilities between the PO and liaison librarian and argue that the role of the product owner is a rebranding of the liaison librarianship model in an effort to make the emotional and relationship labor more masculinized. By emphasizing traditionally masculine work such as technology and innovation, the PO model allows libraries to market these specialized liaison librarian roles in ways that are more prestigious and aligned with corporate culture, while also downplaying traditionally feminized library work, such as service. © 2022 The Author(s).

While the reasons and experiences varied as to why they transitioned from public services to technical services, several common themes emerged for the participants in our study.

It explores how libraries in Malaysia are transforming society through community engagement and highlights initiatives undertaken by libraries that promote community access to collections, services, and events. The success of the initiatives is demonstrated in seven transformation strategy themes, namely; (i) embedded services; (ii) bridges and web technology; (iii) strategic and institutional partnering; (iv) rural libraries; (v) community libraries; (vi) asset-based community development; and (vii) international librarianship. While it is often cited that public libraries are those that serve the community at large, this paper provides the perspective from other types of library viewpoints, emphasizing that such community outreach services should not be limited to public libraries. The library science community at large, and especially academic libraries, must play a role in community engagement. © 2018, The Author(s) 2018.","Community engagement; community outreach programmes; embedded librarianship; library services; library transformation; Malaysia; social trust; strategic partnership","","","","","","Economic Planning Unit; Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE; Universiti Malaya, UM; key government Ministries","Funding text 1: Another major initiative, u-Pustaka (The Ubiquitous Library) was rooted under the National Broadband Initiative to increase the penetration rate in Malaysia with funding from the Economic Planning Unit and technical and financial support from the Malaysia Commission for Multimedia Communication (MCMC) as well as collaboration of other key government Ministries. The initiative featured participation of the National Library, seven public libraries, and a special library (National Institute of Public Administration) at the initial stage. u-Pustaka is an information service based on the ubiquitous concept to provide access anytime, anywhere through a combination of physical and digital library services, including online access to digital resources, online borrowing, and delivery of books through the postal services (Poslaju). Sidek (2010:46) saw the collaboration of libraries as “leveraging of the development traditional information resources to create attractiveness for broadband take-up.” She rationalized that “Community Broadband Centres in underserved areas have flourished and it became obvious that if the content in libraries could be made available nationally, it would spur the adoption of a lifelong learning culture as well as aid the economic and social progress of the nation” (Sidek 2010: 46). The u-Pustaka portal and service was launched on 30th March 2011 at the National Library of Malaysia and is accessible to the public through its URL (www.u-library.gov.my). In line with the goals of the National Broadband Initiative Plan, u-Pustaka enables the bridging of the digital gap between rural and urban communities through improvement in the rate of information and IT literacy, increased broadband penetration in rural areas, and access to life-long learning within rural communities. Salleh (2013) indicated the rapid increase in access to the portal from 82,455 in 2011 to 133,375 in 2013. By 2016, Ahmad (2015) reported that the number accessing the portal has increased substantially to 543,313. Kadir (2014) summarized u-Pustaka’s achievement as “If knowledge is power, u-Pustaka has applied sparkplugs to Malaysia’s knowledge economy through its use of technology to widen access to books, strengthen the library’s ecosystem, and reduce the digital divide”.; Funding text 2: This library community engagement strategy through international librarianship is best illustrated by the CLMV (Cambodia-Laos-Myanmar-Vietnam) international outreach programme and the Librarians Association of Malaysia’s (PPM) mission to Aceh after the Tsunami. Under the CLMV programme, Malaysia’s aspiration is to help the less able ASEAN member countries for the growth of research and higher education and foster collaboration between academia and public administration to ensure that Southeast Asia operates as a “single market for knowledge” (Ramli 2017). A large sum of RM630,000 was mobilized through the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia to the University of Malaya under the “internationalization initiative” and RM90,000 was channeled by the University to the ICT research cluster to initiate ICT related collaborative activities. University of Malaya Library and the library school initiated projects to reach out to libraries in Cambodia and Laos, and purposively selected The National Library of Cambodia (NLC) and the National University of Laos (NUOL) Library as partners. A philosophy of service (i.e. transfer of technology and knowledge) and education is foremost in this project. Zainab, Abrizah and Ling (2012) presented a personal narrative describing visits to universities and libraries in Cambodia and how inclusion and outreach can be shaped through technology and knowledge transfer programme for Cambodians, who in general do not have access to well-resourced libraries. They highlighted one important outcome of a programme to ensure the inclusion of Cambodia in an initiative to provide Cambodian information resources electronically and transferring whatever knowledge or ICT related skills and facilities that can be transferred to Cambodians voluntarily. Under this “reaching out” programme, it was agreed that: (i) University of Malaya (UM) and the University of Malaya Library (UML) will provide the necessary infrastructure and training to digitize selected collections of Cambodian resources. NLC will identify the resources (print, microfiche, microfilms) to be digitized and plan for the resources to be delivered to UML; (ii) This technical correspondent from NLC should be able to visit the University of Malaya for training purposes (digitization of resources) for a maximum of two months. The correspondent will be given a monthly stipend cover the cost of flight, accommodation at the University of Malaya, living allowance and local transportation. Under this initiative, 300 Cambodian works of fiction preserved on microfilm in the NLC have been digitized to PDF format. Today, IT professionals and librarians in Cambodia are able to manage digitized collections and a digital library as well as provide information services and training that addresses essential community needs by making Cambodian library collections and scholarly works more accessible (Ramli, 2017).","Abdul Wahid A.W.B., Katalog Induk Kebangsaan (KIK), Sekitar Perpustakaan, 42, pp. 53-57, (2013); Abrizah A., Trust and authority in scholarly communication in the light of digital transition: Embedding practices and the required competencies for university librarians, (2015); Abu R., Community development and rural public libraries in Malaysia and Australia, (2014); Ahmad N., The role of the National Library in transforming libraries, (2015); Ajis A.F.M., Manaf Z.A., Appraising the quality of Malaysian Union Catalogue, Library Philosophy and Practice, (2013); Baba Z., Redevelopment of library and information services after tsunami: a comparative study of Aceh and Sri Lanka, (2007); Baba Z., Cataloguing course for library assistants in Aceh.

This paper presents the application of the Performance Improvement/HPT model to an Open Educational Resources (OER) initiative in a university library.

From the 1970s until today, due to advancing technology, government documents librarianship has undergone several transformative changes. Beginning with distribution of government information on microfilm through the appearance of electronic information in the 1980s exponentially increased the amount of information available to users, information that often came with a large learning curve to use. The proliferation of government information transformed government documents librarianship from a self-contained, stand-alone, bibliographically focused entity to a more forward-facing, user-centric focus. The depository community is largely led by academic institutions, which account for 72% of depositories. They have lobbied the FDLP for increased access, better training, improvements in delivery, and assurances that electronic information would be found, captured, and preserved. In addition, their efforts have ensured digitization of the historic print depository collection is largely complete. However, until federal statutory legislation changes, significant amounts of born-digital government information is being lost to time. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Depository libraries; Electronic information; Government documents librarians; Government publications; Government publishing office","","","","","","","","Abler R.J., Desktop publishing and the U.S. Federal Government: A viewpoint, Government Publications Review, 15, pp. 205-212, (1988); Adamich T., The “Facebook” effect on FDLP communication using social networking tools in a new context: A Pennsylvania-based approach, DttP: A Quarterly Journal of Government Information Practice & Perspective, 36, 2, pp. 29-32, (2008); Adams L., Government documents technical processing manual.

The target of this work is to present a diachronic revision of the subject organization taking into consideration the resources, the processes, the people who develop them, and the indexing languages employed in such activities. The methodology for this work consists in the revision and analysis of a set of academic sources of information on the topic. This work proves that the subject organization of informational resources has undergone different phases that can be categorized into four different periods: (1) before the establishment of librarianship as a discipline, (2) the stage under the library codes and standards in the nineteenth and twenty centuries, (3) during the second half of the twenty century and (4) the starting of the 21st century. Conclusively, this is an activity that has evolved, constantly, as the informational resources, the technologies employed for their classification, and the needs of their users have required it. © 2021, Universidad Nacional.

Consequently, the academic and research libraries’ traditional role in providing information support and training has been expanded to include support in all aspects of the research lifecycle. Hence, this study systematically reviews the data librarianship literature focusing on current data librarianship services, challenges, skills, and motivational factors. A systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines. A comprehensive search strategy was formulated to extract maximum relevant results. The bibliographic data were retrieved from the Scopus, Web of Science, Library, Information Science and Technology Abstracts (LISTA), and Library and Information Science Abstracts (LISA). Finally, 27 studies that fulfill the criteria were included in this study. The findings revealed that two main factors that contribute to the success or failure in this emerging data librarianship roles are skills, knowledge, and expertise; and limited support and advocacy from library leadership and higher authorities. One is on the part of library professionals who can develop the required skills, knowledge, and expertise and the other is on the part of library leadership. The library professionals are hesitant to embrace this new role due to non-additional benefits, no relevant job description, and lacking leadership support. Overall, the findings revealed that the data librarianship scope is dynamic and has been expanded, albeit the progress is slow. The theoretical, practical, policy, and social implications described that the data librarianship services tend to be improved, and the relevant skills, knowledge, and expertise should be developed. The policy initiatives need to be taken, improved, and expanded to advance technical services related to data librarianship. © The Author(s) 2022.","Academic and research libraries; data librarianship; research data management; research support services; systematic review","","","","","","","","Allchin O., Collins A., Cox A., Et al., Realising our role in research data management, CILIP Update, 12, 3, pp. 36-38, (2013); Antell K., Foote J.B., Turner J., Et al., Dealing with data: Science librarians’ participation in data management at Association of Research Libraries institutions, College & Research Libraries, 75, 4, pp. 557-574, (2014); Ashiq M., Rehman S.U., Safdar M., Et al., Academic library leadership in the dawn of the new millennium: A systematic literature review, The Journal of Academic Librarianship, 47, 3, (2021); Ashiq M., Saleem Q.U.A., Asim M., The perception of Library and Information Science (LIS) professionals about research data management services in University Libraries of pakistan, Libri, 71, pp. 239-249, (2021); Ashiq M., Usmani M.H., Naeem M., A systematic literature review on research data management practices and services, Global Knowledge, Memory and Communication, (2020); Bresnahan M.M., Johnson A.M., Assessing scholarly communication and research data training needs, Reference Services Review, 41, pp. 413-433, (2013); Brown R.A., Wolski M., Richardson J., Developing new skills for research support librarians, The Australian Library Journal, 64, 3, pp. 224-234, (2015); Chawinga W.D., Zinn S., Research data management at an African medical university: Implications for academic librarianship, The Journal of Academic Librarianship, 46, 4, pp. 102-161, (2020); Chiware E.R., Becker D.A., Research data management services in southern Africa: A readiness survey of academic and research libraries, African Journal of Library Archives and Information Science, 28, 1, pp. 1-16, (2018); Chiware E.R.T., Data librarianship in South African academic and research libraries: A survey, Library Management, 41, 6-7, pp. 401-416, (2020); Corrall S., Kennan M.A., Afzal W., Bibliometrics and research data management services: Emerging trends in library support for research, Library Trends, 61, 3, pp. 636-674, (2013); Cox A.M., Kennan M.A., Lyon L., Et al., Developments in research data management in academic libraries: Towards an understanding of research data service maturity, Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology, 68, 9, pp. 2182-2200, (2017); Cox A.M., Kennan M.A., Lyon L., Et al., Maturing research data services and the transformation of academic libraries, Journal of Documentation, 75, 6, pp. 1432-1462, (2019); Faniel I., Connaway L., Librarians’ perspectives on the factors influencing research data management programs, College & Research Libraries, 79, 1, (2018); Federer L., Defining data librarianship: A survey of competencies, skills, and training, Journal of the Medical Library Association JMLA, 106, 3, pp. 294-303, (2018); Fuhr J., How do I do that?

In some disciplinary areas, such as in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields, disabled students are more likely to experience discrimination due to a reportedly more competitive and less flexible and supportive environment. Academic librarians and other educators can make a difference for these students by contributing to a more inclusive campus environment for disabled people in STEM by implementing universally accessible and inclusive pedagogy, resources, services, and spaces. Such efforts are more effective when they incorporate a disability justice perspective, which provides an intersectional framework to understand how individuals experience disability. This paper will present a disability justice-informed perspective in hopes of allowing librarians who work with disabled STEM student to gain a more nuanced understanding of ableism and the many barriers disabled people encounter in STEM fields as well as more broadly in higher education. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2023.","","Engineering education; Libraries; College campus; Disabled people; Disabled students; High educations; Resource service; Resource space; Science technologies; Students","","","","","","","Decker E.

Data librarianship has its origins in the social sciences. In particular, the creation of data services and data archives, in the United Kingdom (Data Archives Services) and in the United States and Canada (Data Library Services), is a key factor for the emergence of data librarianship. The focus of data librarianship nowadays is on the creation of new library services. Data librarians are concerned with the proposition of services for data management and curation in academic libraries and other research organizations. The purpose of this paper is to understand how the complexity of the data can serve as the basis for identifying the technical skills required by data librarians. This essay is systematically divided, first introducing the concepts of data and research data in data librarianship, followed by an overview of data science as a theory, method, and technology to assess data. Next, the identification of the competencies and skills required by data scientists and data librarians are discussed. Our final remarks highlight that data librarians should understand that the complexity and novelty associated with data science praxis. Data science provides new methods and practices for data librarianship. A data librarian need not become a programmer, statistician, or database manager, but should be interested in learning about the languages and programming logic of computers, databases, and information retrieval tools. We believe that numerous kinds of scientific data research provide opportunities for a data librarian to engage with data science. © The Author(s) 2017.","Data; data librarian skills; data librarianship; data science; data scientist skills; research data","","","","","","","","What is ‘Research Data’?, (2013); Burton M., Lyon L., Data science in libraries, Bulletin of the Association for Information Science and Technology, 43, pp. 33-35, (2017); Reference model for an Open Archival Information System (OAIS), Recommendation, (2012); Conway D., Venn Diagram, (2010); Cox A., Verbaan E., Sen B., Upskilling liaison librarians for research data management, Ariadne, 70, (2013); Davenport T.H., Patil D.J., Data scientist: The sexiest job of the 21st century, Harvard Business Review, pp. 70-77, (2012); Hayashi C., What is data science?

This paper aims to investigate the need for mentorship and challenges besetting mentorship in librarianship with specific focus on academic libraries. Design/methodology/approach: Descriptive survey research design was used for the study. The population of the study was 1,214 librarians in 102 academic libraries in Southern Nigeria. Total enumeration sampling technique was adopted for the study. Findings: It was reflected that mentorship, though beset by a number of challenges, is a necessity in librarianship. The hypotheses tested revealed that there is significant relationship between the need for mentorship and the types of mentorship adopted in academic libraries, and that there is no significant difference between the need for mentorship by male and female librarians. Practical implications: This study affirmed that it is through mentorship that librarians can meet their job demands. Mentorship should therefore be stimulated to bolster the professional and intellectual development of the librarians. The mentees should be carried along in mentorship partnership selection process, and training should be organized for mentors and mentees on mentorship. Social implications: The interaction of librarians in the course of mentoring can facilitate work cohesion and enhanced job performance. Originality/value: The needs for and challenges besetting mentorship in librarianship have been explored by collecting data directly from the librarians. The cloistered nature of librarianship, given the changing nature of the profession owing to massive deployment of Information and Communication Technology in the performance of library operations, means that mentorship should be encouraged in the profession. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Librarianship; Libraries; Mentees; Mentors; Mentorship; Professional development","","","","","","","","Abbot J.D., Mentoring; lasting principles and evolutionary changes, (2009); Abolarinwa S.T., Yaya J.A., The place of mentoring in developing librarians’ leadership competency, Asian Journal of Education and e-Learning, 4, 1, pp. 7-14, (2016); Adeniji M.A., Adeniji S.E., Mentoring in academic institutions, Proceedings of secondprofessional summit on Information Science and Technology Nsukka, pp. 397-402, (2010); Adeyemi N.M., Cataloguing and classification and the challenges of new information technologies in nigerian libraries in the next millennium, Automation of Cataloguing Practices in Nigerian libraries.

Design/methodology/approach: Forty-nine job postings between October 2010 and March 2016 were found via the Code4Lib listserv. Information on job title, desired skills and responsibilities and other information was compiled and analyzed. Findings: Twenty-four skills and responsibilities were identified; the top four were metadata, digital preservation, digital collections and digitization. Other skills and responsibilities are frequently listed by ACRL as emerging trends. Research limitations/implications: Digital initiatives librarian job postings have risen substantially in the past five years. A total of 24 skills and responsibilities were identified and skills related to the administration of digital collections are the top desired skills of digital initiatives librarians. Originality/value: Job analysis literature has influenced the design of job descriptions for new roles and the literature offers a “picture of how academic librarianship is developing” (Cox and Corrall, 2013, p. 1528).

Within this framework, all related perspectives should be closely monitored and synchronized between readers and information systems of academic libraries. By utilizing advanced information analysis techniques, libraries are able to serve the readers more efficiently, collaboratively and smartly. Such trend is transforming the academic library to the next generation. In this paper, we propose service-oriented five-layer architecture as a reference for constructing the next generation library. First, we introduce our general structure of Cyber–Physical Library, which constituted by perceptual layer, physical layer, cyber layer, cognition layer and management layer. Second, we present two study cases for demonstrating how the proposed framework works in practical application.

With the rise of new technologies and the advent of a period variously called the “Fourth Industrial Revolution,” “Industry 4.0,” and “The Second Machine Age,” academic librarianship is undergoing various changes in workflow, technology, and service provision. The body of thought that developed out of the Italian Marxist tradition provides ways of thinking through and understanding these changes by placing them within a larger dynamic of capitalist development and the restructuring of labor processes. After looking at changes to academic librarianship from the perspective of immaterial labor and cognitive capitalism, the paper offers ways that academic librarianship can think about the possibility of resistance to these changes. © 2019 The Board of Trustees, University of Illinois.","","","","","","","","","Anderson R., The Digitized Book Corpus and the Cracking Dam.

The study adopted the survey research method. A simple opinion poll was utilized for data collection. Librarians from two geopolitical zones in Nigeria were selected to form a sample for the study. Opinions were gathered on a 100 percent response rate. Findings revealed that academic libraries in Nigeria, even in their partial automated stages, aspire toward full automation, which also reflected the urgent need for system librarians trained in computer science and in library and information science to oversee the automation projects. It is therefore recommended that computer coding should be made a requirement for librarians in training: furthermore, librarians should embrace knowledge sharing and networking. This can be realized through continuous training and retraining on a compulsory annual sponsorship for librarians in library-based computer training programs.  © 2020 Common Ground Research Networks, Helen Uzoezi Emasealu, All Rights Reserved.","Academic Libraries; Computer Experts; Information and Communication Technology; Librarianship","","","","","","","","Adegbore Adebayo M., Automation in Two Nigerian University Libraries, Library Philosophy and Practice (e-journal), 425, (2010); Agu Godswill A., Acha Ikechukwu A., Anyanwu Aham, Marketing Implications of Call Drops for the Patronage of GSM Services in Nigeria, Developing Country Studies, 3, 8, pp. 82-89, (2013); Amaechi Nkechi M., Enweani Uchechukwu V., Eke Catherine C., Challenges to Library and Information Services (LIS) Delivery in the 21st Century: The Situation in Three Academic Libraries in Imo State, Nigeria, Library Philosophy and Practice (ejournal), 2075, (2018); Barton Jane, Digital Librarians: Boundary Riders on the Storm, Library Review, 55, 2, pp. 85-90, (2006); Biddiscombe Richard, The Development of Information Professionals' Needs for Internet and IT Skills: Experiences at the University of Birmingham, Program: Electronic Library and Information Systems, 35, 2, pp. 157-166, (2001); Dholakiya Pratik, The Role and Influence of Social Media on the Modern PR Industry, (2016); Dority Kim, Technologies Librarians Need to Know: Current and Emerging Library Technology Trends in 2017, (2017); Emasealu Helen U., Automation of Academic Libraries and Web-Development: A Reverie or Reality, International Journal of Knowledge Content Development & Technology, 9, 1, pp. 43-56, (2019); Emasealu Helen U., Umeozor Susan N., Application of Social Media in the Promotion of Research Activities: Librarians as Catalysts, Library and Information Science Digest, 11, 2, pp. 1-14, (2018); Emezie Nkeiru A., Nwaohiri Ngozi M., 21st Century Librarians and Effective Information Service Delivery, Journal of Information and Knowledge Management, 4, 1, pp. 30-43, (2013); National Policy on Education, (2004); Fourie Ina, Librarians and the Claiming of New Roles: How Can We Try to Make a Difference?, Aslib Proceedings, 56, 1, pp. 62-74, (2004); Garrod Penny, Staff Training and End-User Training Issues within the Hybrid Library, Informing Science, 4, 1, pp. 25-34, (2001); Grigsby Susan K., The Transforming Role of Librarians (and Libraries), (2019); Hillenbrand Candy, Librarianship in the 21st Century-Crisis or Transformation?, The Australian Library Journal, 54, 2, pp. 164-181, (2005); Iwhiwhu Basil E., Ruteyan Josiah O., Eghwubare Aroghene, Mobile Phones for Library Services: Prospects for Delta State University Library, Abraka, Library Philosophy and Practice (e-journal), 346, (2010); Kawatra P., Textbook of Information Science, (2000); Kim Bohyun, Why Not Grow Coders from the Inside of Libraries?, (2009); Kwanya Tom, Stiwell Christine, Underwood Peter, Library 3.0: Intelligence Libraries and Apomediation, (2015); Morrison Jim, Riders on the Storm, (1971); Nageswara Rao K., Babu K.

Protecting user privacy is a cherished ethical position held within this field. Therefore, it is worth asking whether libraries have been aggressive enough to protect this standard, given the rapid advancement of information technology, digital surveillance, cybercrime, commercial exploitation of user data, and emerging privacy threats for the individual and culture. This paper seeks to reconcile the ethical vision with the hard reality that emerging cyber threats can easily circumvent basic library efforts to protect user data. The author imagines the “black box” library, which would be the end result of radical adherence to the ethical standard. In short, the “black box” library would protect freedom of conscience for the user by adhering to extremely rigorous standards, including: Mass encryption, proxy services, legal enforcement of privacy provisions in vendor contracts, recordless inventory systems, and other strict measures. The vision is for a space where critical information flows in, but very little if any “digital exhaust” escapes it. © 2021, Published with license by Taylor & Francis.

With quantitative and qualitative data analyses, the study builds three conceptual models to demonstrate how students’ study-related data engagement and backgrounds may influence their attitudes toward multi-aspect library data services, including general data services, an institutional data repository, if available, as a data resource, and institutional data repository-based services. The study’s findings support library data services’ cross-disciplinary, multidimensional, and multilevel nature, addressing the value of institutional data repositories and repository-based data services in comprehensively promoting data literacy competencies of all groups in all disciplines. The contribution of this study, beyond being among the first to look at library data services from a holistic perspective to support college students’ DLCs, includes a call for further explorations of student data engagement practice and verifying and generalizing the current study findings by investigating more students’ data services need in more college communities. © The Author 2023.","Academic library; college student; data engagement; data librarianship; data literacy competencies; institutional data repositories; library data services","","","","","","City University of New York, CUNY; Professional Staff Congress and City University of New York, PSC-CUNY, (62607-00 50)","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by the Professional Staff Congress - City University of New York (PSC-CUNY) Research Award Program (award number 62607-00 50).

It considers the book’s deeply intertwined relationships with other media through ownership structures, copyright and adaptation, the constantly shifting roles of authors, publishers and readers in the digital ecosystem and the merging of print and digital technologies in contemporary understandings of the book object. Divided into three parts, the book first introduces students to various theories and methods for understanding print culture, demonstrating how the study of the book has grown out of longstanding academic disciplines. The second part surveys key sectors of the contemporary book world – from independent and alternative publishers to editors, booksellers, readers and libraries – focusing on topical debates. In the final part, digital technologies take centre stage as eBook regimes and mass-digitisation projects are examined for what they reveal about information power and access in the twenty-first century. This book provides a fascinating and informative introduction for students of all levels in publishing studies, book history, literature and English, media, communication and cultural studies, cultural sociology, librarianship and archival studies and digital humanities. © 2021 Simone Murray.","","","","","","","","","Ahmed T., “Harry Potter First Edition Book Sells for $57,000’, Newsweek 11 Oct, (2019); Anderson B., Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origins and Spread of Nationalism.

This was paramount for achieving a universal culture and for accessing science and technology achievements which were required by these societies. Later, outstanding work was carried out in the creation of the Escuela Interamericana de Bibliotecología. It was founded on October 19, 1956, and its name intended to outline its destiny and objectives: A university entity, part of the Universidad de Antioquia (Colombia), with Latin American vocation, training professional cadres for the libraries of the region, with aspirations of modernity and a quality curriculum that would include the current trends of world librarianship. This article addresses the importance that this institution granted to its library and academic staff which, from the beginning, has been fundamental to the Escuela Interamericana de Bibliotecología's development. It also highlights the work and the influence of the journal Revista Interamericana de Bibliotecología in the surrounding countries, as well as the contribution to international meetings and the renewal of academic exchanges in order to consolidate the discipline of librarianship. © 2017 Escuela Interamericana de Bibliotecologia.

Identification of these adoption factors will help to design SNS in the way that led to their seamless diffusion in university libraries, making them capable of providing reliable and useful market knowledge to the business community. Design/methodology/approach: To meet the research objectives, this study is based on the technology adoption model (TAM). The survey was conducted with 50 librarians of various universities across Europe, Asia, America, Africa and Australia, sampled through non probabilistic sampling techniques-purposive and snowball sampling. The collected data are analyzed through partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to estimate the formulated structural equation model using SmartPLS 3.2.9 software version. Findings: The results indicate that university librarians have high perception about usefulness and ease of using SNS for meeting their business objectives. The perceived usefulness (PU) is solely based on the prolonged adoption of SNS technology in personal lives of the librarians. The perceived ease of use (PEU) is triggered by the increasing quality of evolving SNS technology, especially user friendliness. The prolonged use of technology, increasing market entry of brands and improving quality of SNS will overcome librarian resistance to use SNS for market research related support to business community. Evolving technologies are more likely to be adopted seamlessly in entrepreneurial libraries. Research limitations/implications: This study has implications for librarians, entrepreneurs and technology providers. Librarians should have flexible technology adoption policies in place to keep technology adoption synchronized with changing market conditions. Entrepreneurs should share clear and accurate business needs as well as practicing ethical and lawful business practices. They should also help libraries to gain new skills to make future adoption easier. Technology providers should focus on improving the quality of their technology by increasing their functional utilities, performance and reliability as well as making them more user-friendly. Originality/value: This study investigates technology adoption of SNS in libraries from the perspective of providing market research related services to entrepreneurs rather than just digitalizing library services for student users. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Academic libraries; Business model innovation; Globalization; Librarianship; Market research; Social networking technology; Startups","","","","","","European Union's Horizon research and innovation programme","Funding: This research is funded by the European Union's Horizon research and innovation programme (Project ID:101061516, Project Acronym: LibrarIN).

Based in our campus’ main library, we hope to model that students’ and community members’ personal interests are worthy of academic study and further establish Hip Hop Studies’ presence at Virginia Tech, the academy, and in the larger community. To that end, the VTDITC community has designed, taught, and assessed more than 150 community-based media literacy workshops over the past half decade. We have demonstrated, explained, and created opportunities for a wide variety of learners to experience the science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics inherent to the hip hop culture. We have learned alongside a diversity of audiences—from elementary school children to adults. To name just a few of our partner organizations, we have worked with the 4H Virginia Congress, the Boys & Girls Clubs of Southwest Virginia, Higher Achievement, Inc., a variety of public libraries including our regular collaborator Roanoke Public Libraries, the Science Museum of Western Virginia, Virginia’s Summer Residential Governor's School for Humanities, and the West End Center for Youth. In our contribution to The Global Drumbeat: Permeations of Hip Hop across Diverse Information Worlds, we will outline and explain an example lesson plan from one of our workshops. We will provide our learning outcomes as well as our assessment plan. Additionally, we will detail the theoretical underpinnings and guiding principles that inform our pedagogical decision making. Our workshops take a hands-on, practitioner-minded, and co-creation approach to teaching media literacy. Inasmuch, this contribution will also provide a recommended list of music creation equipment and other appropriate classroom technology that will accommodate a variety of budgets. Furthermore, we will include several promising practices and recommendations gained from more than 50 years of collective experience creating hip hop music and 10 years of collective experience teaching the hip hop arts. Our hope is that this contribution will inspire other library workers and educators to remix our workshops to suit the needs of their communities. © 2022,International Journal of Information, Diversity and Inclusion.All Rights Reserved","Experiential learning; Hip hop librarianship; Media literacy; Pedagogy","","","","","","","","Adjapong E.

Los trabajos que reciben un gran número de citaciones tienen mucho interés debido a que se pueden considerar influyentes en el desarrollo de la ciencia en un dominio científico determinado (Bauer; Leydesdorff; Bornmann, 2016). El supuesto de que los trabajos muy citados se establecen como los documentos fundamentales o claves, “seminal documents”, en un área de investigación se propuso también en el denominado modelo CAB (Citation-Assisted Background) (Kostoff; Shlesinger, 2005). En relación con esto, la herramienta analítica Essential Science Indicators (ESI), disponible a través de la plataforma Web of Knowledge, se construye a partir de todas las bases del datos del Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) y proporciona estadísticas para hacer seguimientos de las tendencias en el mundo científico a través de dos indicadores: (1) Artículos más citados en los últimos 10 años (Highly cited papers); y (2) Artículos más citados en los últimos dos años (hot papers). La herramienta ESI se ha utilizado en diversas investigaciones para evaluar los resultados científicos con alta precisión (Csajbók et al., 2007; Chuang; Wang; Ho, 2011; Fu et al., 2011). Diferentes estudios bibliométricos se han ocupado de la excelencia de los documentos muy citados y su contribución al progreso científico en una disciplina (Aksnes, 2003; Small, 2004; Wang, 2013). En el área de investigación BIC también se han desarrollado trabajos que parten del análisis de los documentos altamente citados (Levitt; Thelwall, 2009; Blessinger; Hrycaj, 2010; Ivanović; Ho, 2016), pero nunca desde el método del análisis de co-palabras.; Funding text 2: La hipótesis que se planteó en este estudio partió de la premisa de que las citas de los trabajos de investigación son un indicador de la influencia que tienen en un área de conocimiento, originando nuevas ideas y focos temáticos emergentes. A partir de los documentos altamente citados, el objetivo de este trabajo fue aplicar la metodología del análisis de co-palabras para identificar la estructura conceptual, y los principales frentes de investigación del área BIC, durante el periodo 2007-2017.; Funding text 3: Se identificó otro frente de investigación dedicado a la implementación de la confianza y seguridad en los entornos virtuales (cluster 3). La palabra clave “trust” se configuró como un término esencial en este bloque temático, constatándose que, con el aumento de las tecnologías sociales y la interconexión de las personas en la red Internet, hay una necesidad de implementar mecanismos de confianza y seguridad que permitan reducir los riesgos percibidos en las redes de comunicaciones. Los estudios sobre la confianza se establecieron como tema central en el contexto online donde puede haber mucha incertidumbre. Por tanto, se comprobó que la implementación de las Tecnologías de la Información (TIs) en los entornos virtuales del comercio electrónico y social ha sido una cuestión relevante para los investigadores del campo BIC.; Funding text 4: Otra línea de investigación estuvo centrada en los modelos de adopción y aceptación de las TIs, en el que se agruparon estudios sobre cómo los usuarios llegan a aceptar y utilizar las nuevas tecnologías (cluster 4). Los modelos más estudiados, según el análisis de co-palabras, partieron de la perspectiva del usuario como principal fuente de innovación en las organizaciones y se centraron en algunos de los siguientes sistemas: “Modelo de Aceptación de la Tecnología” (TAM, Technology Acceptance Model) y “Teoría Unificada de Aceptación y Uso de Tecnología” (UTAUT, Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology). Las palabras clave en este grupo temático se centraron en los diversos factores que influyen en la adopción de una TI, como: utilidad percibida por los usuarios, facilidad de uso o influencia social. Además, se identificó un nodo importante relativo a la adopción de tecnologías por parte de los profesionales de la salud y el acceso a las historias clínicas digitales.","Aksnes D.W., Characteristics of highly cited papers, Research Evaluation, 12, 3, pp. 159-170, (2003); Batagelj V., Mrvar A., Pajek: A program for large network analysis, Connections, 21, 2, pp. 47-57, (1998); Bauer J., Leydesdorff L., Bornmann L., Highly cited papers in Library and Information Science (LIS): Authors, institutions, and network structures, Journal of The Association for Information Science and Technology, 67, 12, pp. 3095-3100, (2016); Blessinger K., Hrycaj P., Highly cited articles in library and information science: An analysis of content and authorship trends, Library and Information Science Research, 32, 2, pp. 156-162, (2010); Callon M., Courtial J., Penan H., Cienciometría, (1995); Cho J., Intellectual structure of the institutional repository field: A co-word analysis, Journal of Information Science, 40, 3, pp. 386-397, (2014); Chuang K.Y., Wang M.H., Ho Y.S., High-impact papers presented in the subject category of water resources in the Essential Science Indicators database of the Institute for Scientific Information, Scientometrics, 87, 3, pp. 551-562, (2011); Csajbok E., Et al., Hirsch-index for countries based on Essential Science Indicators data, Scientometrics, 73, 1, pp. 91-117, (2007); Ding Y., Chowdhury G.G., Foo S., Bibliometric cartography of information retrieval research by using co-word analysis, InformationProcessingandManagement, 37, 6, pp. 817-842, (2001); Fu H.Z., Et al., Characteristics of research in China assessed with Essential Science Indicators, Scientometrics, 88, 3, pp. 841-862, (2011); Glanzel W., Schubert A., Some facts and figures on highly cited papers in the sciences, 1981-1985, Scientometrics, 25, 3, pp. 373-380, (1992); Hu J., Zhang Y., Research patterns and trends of recommendation system in China using co-word analysis, Information Processing and Management, 51, 4, pp. 329-339, (2015); Ivanovic D., Ho Y., Highly cite darticlesin the Information Science and Library Science category in Social Science Citation Index: Abibliometricanalysis, Journal of Librarian Shipand Information Science, 48, 1, pp. 36-46, (2016); Kostoff R., Shlesinger M., CAB: Citation-assisted background, Scientometrics, 62, 2, pp. 199-212, (2005); Kostoff R.N., Et al., The structure and infrastructure of the global nanotechnology literature, Journal of Nanoparticle Research, 8, 3-4, pp. 301-321, (2006); Levitt J.M., Thelwall M., The most highly cited Library and Information Science articles: Interdisciplinarity, first authors and citation patterns, Scientometrics, 78, 1, pp. 45-67, (2009); Leydesdorff L., Hellsten I., Measuring the meaning of words in contexts: An automated analysis of controversies about'Monarch butterflies', 'Frankenfoods', and 'stem cells, Scientometrics, 67, 2, pp. 231-258, (2006); Leydesdorff L., Welbers K., The semantic mapping of words and co-words in contexts, Journal of Informetrics, 5, 3, pp. 469-475, (2011); Li T., Ho Y.S., Li C.Y., Bibliometric analysis on global Parkinson's disease research trends during 1991-2006, NeuroscienceLetters, 441, 3, pp. 248-252, (2008); Liberatore G., Herrero-Solana V., Caracterización temática de la investigación en Ciencia de la Información en Brasil en el período 2000-2009, Transinformação, 25, 3, pp. 225-235, (2013); Noyons E.C.M., Moed H.F., Luwel M., Combining mapping and citation analysis for evaluative bibliometric purposes: A bibliometric study, Journal of The Association for Information Science and Technology, 50, 2, pp. 115-131, (1999); Olmeda-Gomez C., Ovalle-Perandones M.A., Perianes-Rodriguez A., Co-word analysis and thematic landscapes in Spanish information science literature, 1985-2014, Scientometrics, 113, 1, pp. 195-217, (2017); O'Reilly T., What is Web 2.0: Design patterns and business models for the next generation of software, International Journal of Digital Economics, 65, pp. 17-37, (2007); Ravikumar S., Agrahari A., Singh S.N., Document mapping the intellectual structure of scientometrics: A co-word analysis of the journal scientometrics (2005-2010), Scientometrics, 102, 1, pp. 929-955, (2015); Small H., Why authors think their papers are highly cited, Scientometrics, 60, 3, pp. 305-316, (2004); Small H., Tracking and predicting growth areas in science, Scientometrics, 68, 3, pp. 595-610, (2006); Van Eck N.J., Methodological Advances in Bibliometric Mapping Science, (2011); Van Eck N.J., Waltman L., How to normalize co-occurrence data?

The study is anchored by five objectives and is limited to Federal University of Technology, Minna with academic librarians as target respondent. The study adopted census design method as means of gathering data with a target population of 97 staff of the library and a total enumeration was used for the research. The questionnaire was used as instrument of data collection. One hypothesis was tested at 0.05 level of significant and data was presented in frequency, Tables and percentages. The hypotheses were analyzed using T-test method. The finding reveals that libraries are actively involved in all accreditation process since it makes available and accessible information resources that are necessary and critical for accreditation. It was concluded that a number of constraints such as inadequate funding and erratic power supply affect library role in accreditation. The study recommended sufficient financial support should be given to academic libraries to enable them function effective, alternative power supply should be worked on for library to have a stable power supply, enough skilled personnel with background knowledge in librarianship should be put in charge of the library and academic libraries should also invest in acquisition of electronic resources, as the world is going digital.","Academic libraries; Accreditation; Undergraduate programmes","","","","","","","","Abubabakar B.M., The library as the academic life wire of the university, (2011); Accreditation criteria: Policies, Procedures and Standards, (2016); Adegbesan S.O., Establishing quality assurance in Nigerian education system: Implication for educational managers, Educational Research and Reviews, 6, 2, pp. 147-151, (2011); Afolabi M.O., ""The library, (2014); Ajayi I.A., Akindutire I.O., The unresolved issues of quality assurance in Nigerian universities, Journal of Sociology and Education in Africa, 6, 1, pp. 1-16, (2007); Akomolafe C.O., The Practice and Prospects of Accreditation of Academic Programs in Universities in Nigeria: The Perspective of Academic Staff, International Journal of Education administration, 1, 1, pp. 59-68, (2009); Bello M.A., Accreditation and the role of academic library in undergraduate programs: a case study of fountain university, Osogbo, Journal of humanities and social science, 19, 10, pp. 45-49, (2014); Ozurumba C.N., Ebuara V.O., Relevance of Programmes Accreditation in Nigeria Universities for Quality Assurance for Quality Assurance, Asia Pacific Journal of Education, Arts and Sciences, 1, 4, (2014); Carr D.A., Academic library practices in 21st century: The perspective of professional librarian, Journal of Education and Practice, 16, 8, pp. 141-147, (2007); Hayward F.M., Quality Assurance and Accreditation of Higher Education in Africa, (2006); Kigongo-Bukenya I.M.N., Global library and information concerns: The case of international accreditation qualifications, (2005); Lohr S.L., Sampling: Design and Analysis, (2009); Weekly Bulletin, 4, 46, (2009); Nkiko C., Yusuf F.O., Accreditation issues for library and information science schools, Journal of applied information science and technology, 1, 1, pp. 70-82, (2007); Obadara O.E., Abayomi A.A., Accreditation and Quality Assurance in Nigerian Universities, Journal of Education and Practice, 4, 8, pp. 26-32, (2013); Okojie J.A., Licensing, accreditation and quality assurance in Nigerian universities: Achievements and challenges, (2008); Okebukola P., Okebukola counts blessing of varsity system, (2006); Onwudinjo O.T., Law Journal Collections: Accreditation Issues and Imperatives for Law, Library Philosophy and Practice, 7, 5, pp. 148-152, (2015); Oseghale O., Faculty Opinion as Collection Evaluation Method: a case study of Redeemer's University Library, Library Philosophy and Practice, pp. 1-8, (2008); Assessing quality in higher education, (2006)","","","University of Idaho Library","","","","","","15220222","","","","English","Libr.

After entering the 21st century, the number of articles on library history research in China has entered a period of rapid growth, especially in the past decade. This paper points out the direction and measures to be improved in the study of library history in China. First, we should establish a great conception of history and promote the systematization and ideological content of research. Under the guidance of the grand conception of history and guided by the consciousness of problems, library historians can have a unique insight to examine the logical changes of history and explore the laws from the perspective of connection and development by examining and debating small and numerous historical materials. Second, the research methods are based on literature interpretation, assisted by a variety of other methods. It is necessary to clarify the advantages and disadvantages of quantitative research, digital humanities, oral history and other methods according to specific research objects, research purposes and the actual situation of historical materials and make flexible use in practice. Third, we should expand the sources of historical materials. including tapping the potential of direct sources of historical materials and exploring indirect sources of historical materials, strengthen the preservation and utilization of physical historical materials, audio visual historical materials and modern new carrier digital historical materials, promote the compilation and utilization of archival historical materials, etc., and pay attention to the academic norms for the utilization of historical materials. Fourth, a reasonable talent team and evaluation mechanism of research achievements should be set up. The library history research team needs to absorb genuine aspirants who are driven by interest, possess certain historical research accomplishments and master systematic knowledge of library science. Independent writing should be encouraged. We should improve the mechanism of achievement evaluation, expanding the types of award-winning achievements and taking the quality of papers as the criterion of evaluation. Fifth, research results should be paid attention to all-round dissemination. Efforts should be made to establish research journals on library history in China to strengthen the dissemination and popularization among the public both abroad and outside the academic circles of libraries, and new media should be made full use for publicity. In the future, nine major specific research fields can be deepened and expanded: 1) paying attention to the principles of library history studies and to the research on the history of library history; 2) carrying out a comprehensive study on the history of library science terms, concepts and ideas; 3) increasing the research on the dimension of library science system history and library social history; 4) highlighting the research of reading history with library characteristics: 5) enriching new perspectives and new fields of research on figures; 6) following up the research on the history of library technology and the history of digital resources construction & service; 7) improving the quality of compiling library historical records; 8) reviving the research of ancient library history and consolidating the research of contemporary library history: 9) expanding the study of library history in the regional and spatial dimensions. It is the historical responsibility of Chinese library historiography researchers to construct a library historiography theory and method system that can conform to international standards with Chinese style and to enhance the international discourse power of Chinese scholars. 57 refs. © 2020, Editorial Office of Journal of Library Science in China.

The study aims to discover the factors influencing the adoption of IoT in university libraries, investigate the impact of IoT on university library services and identify challenges to adopt IoT applications in university libraries. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review was carried out to address the objectives of the study. The 40 most relevant research papers published in the world’s leading digital databases were selected to conduct the study. Findings: The findings illustrated that rapid growth in technology, perceived benefits, the networked world and the changing landscape of librarianship positively influenced the adoption of IoT in university libraries. The study also displayed that IoT supported library professionals to initiate smart library services, assisted in service efficiency, offered context-based library services, provided tracking facilities and delivered effective management of library systems. Results also revealed that a lack of technical infrastructure, security and privacy concerns, a lack of technological skills and unavailability of policy and strategic planning caused barriers to the successful adoption of IoT applications in university libraries. Originality/value: The study has provided theoretical implications through a valuable addition to the current literature. It has also offered managerial implications for policymakers to construct productive policies for the implementation of IoT applications in university libraries for the attainment of fruitful outcomes. Finally, the study provides a baseline for understanding the adoption of IoT in academic libraries. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Challenges; Factors; Impacts; Internet of Things; Smart library services;

This first curriculum suffered from a strong presence of subjects from the humanities, with a low fraction of experimental work in many subjects because of its inclusion within the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters. The first years attracted large numbers of students. However, the subsequent decrease in the number of students pursuing the degree drove us to initiate a change toward blended and online modalities. The Librarianship and Documentation Area of the University of León (ULe) already has a long history in blended teaching, starting with the Degree in Librarianship and Documentation, which has used the platform aul@unileon since the 2006–2007 academic year; the Degree of Information and Documentation has used the blended modality since the 2010–2011 academic year, and it has been offered in the distance learning modality since the 2014–2015 academic year. These new technologies have been fully introduced into university education and have facilitated the teaching–learning process through the use of interactive programs via the Internet. The main objective of this column is to determine and study the kind of multimedia tools used by professors of the Bachelor of Information and Documentation at the University of León during the teaching–learning process and in virtual teaching before the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as to report which new tools were introduced by the university for this reason. We study the student–teacher and student–student interactions to help promote communication and participatory learning through chats, forums, email, hangouts, Skype, Meet, videoconferences, etc. To carry out this study, two types of methodology were applied: satisfaction surveys implemented by the Quality Office of the ULe to determine the degree of satisfaction of students and teachers, and a study of annual reports. © 2022 The Authors","Blended education; Information and documentation science; Multimedia tools; Online teaching; University of León (Spain); Virtual learning environments","","","","","","","","Gallego Lorenzo J., Martin Vega A., Las competencias sobre la materia de fuentesde la información en el Grado e Información y Documentación.

Since books and libraries came into being in human society , there have been studies on them. However , library study is not library science. Taking university education as originating symbol , library science as a discipline has just a history of over 100 years. This article describes the development of the internationalization of Chinese library science and the Chinization of international library science from an international perspective based on historical research methodology. From the international perspective , the development of Chinese library science has gone through two stages the process is long tortuous and frustrating and the result is full of hope and future. At first , the internationalization of Chinese library science , including 1) Introduction of Western library concepts: The idea of public libraries was introduced into China because of the spread of Western learning after the Opium War , 1840 —1898; 2) Introduction of Japanese library concepts: The establishment of some provincial public libraries were products of preparing constitutionalism in the Qing Dynasty , 1905 — 1911; 3) Introduction of American librarianship: Dewy Decimal Classification, Card Catalogue , Alphabetic - Order Table, Cataloging Rules of the Library of Congress and so on , 1912-1949; 4) Introduction of Soviet Union librarianship: During the Cold War , Chinese library science was mainly influenced by the Soviet Union , 1950- I960; 5) Introduction of Western librarianship: After Reform and Opening-up , Chinese library science widely communicates with other countries all over the world, 1978-Now. Secondly , the Chinization of international library science: 1) Professional aspects were mainly reflected in Chinization of international standards: Classification , cataloging , thesaurus and MARC; 2) Technical aspects were mainly embodied in Chinization of international technologies: CALIS , CADAL and CASHL projects in academic libraries , National Digital Library of China and National Culture Information Resources Sharing Project in public libraries , NSTL project in technology libraries; 3) Theoretical aspects were mainly manifested in Chinization of international ideology: Including innovation of legal system and practice． This article holds the idea that the ultimate goal of library science is promoting the progress of library culture and society summarizes the major contributions of Chinese library science in the last one hundred years in the fields of international standards information technology and core values of library , and suggests that Chinese library scholars should make the world heard the voice of Chinese librarians promote Chinese library science and innovation．12 refs． © 2019, Editorial Office of Journal of Library Science in China.

Derived from comprehensive interviews with ten experience ALs, this study distinguishes three key areas of contribution towards user-centric and effective e-learning: bolstering user experience and usability; endorsing continuous improvement and professional development; and stimulating interdepartmental collaboration and innovation. Despite the significant progress made by ALs, the study acknowledges the formidable challenges faced by these professionals in their capacity as DSs, specifically in areas of professional growth and evaluation. The paper presents strategic recommendations to overcome these obstacles, such as amplifying ALs' data science competencies, advocating for ongoing professional development, and endorsing the validation of their expertise through accreditation. By highlighting the essential role and proactive contributions of ALs as DSs, this study offers valuable insights and guidelines towards cultivating a robust and influential e-learning environment. Concluding with suggestions for future research, this study aims to propel the progression of academic librarianship and the enhancement of e-learning outcomes. © 2023 Academic Conferences Limited.

In an analysis of a nationwide study of LIS professionals, alumni, and faculty from five iSchools, this article addresses this topic by exploring the knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) that are considered core for professional public librarians and how they align with current trends in the field. The study also examines how the KSAs for public librarianship compare with those for academic and school librarianship. The results are salient for public library directors, managers, and others concerned with trends in public libraries and LIS students interested in public library careers. The findings will also be of interest to LIS faculty as they review and develop curricula to prepare emerging public library professionals. © 2020 by The University of Chicago.

To cultivate critical thinkers, librarians continue to build innovative practices, even as technology rapidly evolves. However, the pervasiveness of misinformation and disinformation, most recently seen in the conspiratorial worldviews of QAnon, challenges librarians to center critical thinking in their information literacy praxis. In this article, we provide a concise overview of QAnon and the problems that contemporary internet conspiracy theories like it pose. We offer an epistemological shift for information literacy, from heuristics to mindsets and behaviors, drawing on disciplines external to librarianship. Finally, we consider the role that emotions play in the promotion and spread of conspiracism. Equipping librarians with a better understanding of conspiracy thinking and the tools to counter it will in turn empower the next generation of critical thinkers. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Academic librarianship; Conspiracy thinking; Critical thinking; Information literacy; QAnon","","","","","","","","Abalakina-Paap M., Stephan W.G., Craig T., Gregory W.L., Beliefs in conspiracies, Political Psychology, 20, 3, pp. 637-647, (1999); Agnoli F., Krantz D.H., Suppressing natural heuristics by formal instruction: The case of the conjunction fallacy, Cognitive Psychology, 4, (1989); American Library Association, Core values of librarianship [text].

When law librarians must catch up on trends and developments necessary to perform well in the academic library setting, the challenges intensify. This research aims to develop the field of academic law librarianship in the Philippines by analyzing the competencies and training needs of these specialist librarians in the country. The results of this study indicate that academic law librarians are highly competent in performing tasks under core competencies, library management, reference, research and client services, collection development, and cataloging. But these same professionals are just competent in tasks related to information technology. The respondents perceive that continuing professional development and benchmarking are necessary to the furthering of their careers. Recommendations are made here to prioritize training programs on the following topics: (1) basic understanding of relevant legal systems and areas of law, (2) library instructional materials design, and (3) knowledge and navigation of legal information sources. It is these skills that are the most pressing competencies, for upskilling, identified by the librarians participating in this research. This study gathered data using a survey questionnaire, with the results analyzed using descriptive statistical tools, such as extracting means and percentages, and the use of Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient. © 2020, The International Academic Forum (IAFOR).

Scales for the identification and classification of the skills and competencies needed to work in the library and information science profession can contribute to the development of academic and professional programs. This empirical survey was conducted in Israel among members of two library and information science listservs. The final sample included 183 valid questionnaires. The study tested the viability of a typology comprised of 46 skills and competencies as items in multi-items scales. Factor analysis and Cronbach’s Alpha were utilized in performing the analysis that resulted in four clusters: technology skills, information skills, personal competencies and traditional librarianship skills and show that 25 out of 46 original skills contribute to the explanation of 44% of the total variance. The study contributes to the literature on the subject by proposing updated scales that examine practitioners’ views and opinions of which skills and competencies they needed in information work. The typology that resulted from the study ascertains that, regardless of the rapid changes that the profession has confronted in the last decades, the skills that have been at the core of the profession are still relevant alongside technological skills related to online environments such as website development and management. © The Author(s) 2018.","Competencies;

Design/methodology/approach: This research applied the grounded theory method based on the three open, axial and selective coding steps (Strauss and Corbin, 1998). The research tool was interviews conducted with 20 experts in librarianship, marketing and branding. Findings: Library building architecture, library information resources and services, librarians' branding, marketing activities and library management are the causal conditions affecting brand building. The national economic situation, the digital publishing situation in the country and different characteristics of the new library community are the intervening conditions affecting brand building. The role of other libraries in society in the scientific education of the new generation provides contextual conditions for brand building. The higher education system and the library parent organization play a part in the operative actions/interactions for brand building. The consequences of brand building are brand image development, brand excellence and brand behavioral loyalty for libraries. Library brand identity is also a core category in brand building. Originality/value: Facing steep challenges by emergent services, academic libraries are ill-prepared to meet the needs of the new information society solely with traditional services and functions. Academic libraries are required to rebrand themselves to be more successful at delivering a strong performance within a changing information environment by enhancing their brand image and establishing a more effective relationship with users. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Academic libraries;

It was designed not only to reach archivists and academic library staff at every career stage, but also to encourage them to participate in the program as both mentors and mentees in order to share their unique interests. For example, many new professionals are entering the workforce with coveted skills in information and education technology. While they may benefit from being mentored by their more experienced colleagues, they may also participate in the program as mentors so that others may benefit from their skills and knowledge. The holistic, or whole person approach to the design of the program offers mentoring on a range of topics that move beyond professional development and the promotion and tenure process, into issues of personal development and work-life balance. This paper describes, in detail, the mentoring program that was developed in less than one year by an ad hoc committee with administrative support. It includes the steps required to participate in the program as a mentee or mentor, training materials, and lessons learned. Grounded in best practices, the design is flexible and sustainable and is transferable to other environments for those that are considering or rethinking mentoring at their own libraries.","","","","","","","","","Barry B., Feeney M.K., Toward a useful theory of mentoring a conceptual analysis and critique, Administration & Society, 39, 6, (2007); Burke Ronald J., Mentors in organizations, Group & Organization Management 9, 3, pp. 353-372, (1984); Kram K., Mentoring at Work: Developmental Relationships in Organizational Life, (1985); Harrington Marni R., Marshall E., Analyses of mentoring expectations, activities, and support in canadian academic libraries, College & Research Libraries, 75, 6, (2014); Allen Tammy D., Lentz E., Day R., Career success outcomes associated with mentoring others: A comparison of mentors and nonmentors, Journal of Career Development, 32, 3, pp. 272-285, (2006); Kram, Mentoring at Work, 613; Kram, Mentoring at Work; Lorenzetti Diane L., Powelson S.E., A scoping review of mentoring programs for academic librarians, The Journal of Academic Librarianship, 41, 2, pp. 186-196, (2015); Allen Tammy D., Eby L.T., Lentz E., Mentorship behaviors and mentorship quality associated with formal mentoring programs: Closing the gap between research and practice, Journal of Applied Psychology, 91, 3, (2006); Lorenzetti, Powelson, A Scoping Review of Mentoring Programs for Academic Librarians; Harrington, Marshall, Analyses of Mentoring Expectations, Activities, and Support in Canadian Academic Libraries; Mcgill association of university teachers, librarians section professional issues committee, Report on Onboarding and Orientation for Librarians and Other Library Staff, (2014); Mcgill association of university teachers, Report on Mentoring Practices at McGill.

In 2014, the College of Staten Island (CSI) faced a serious serials access problem. A number of subscribed titles were temporarily not accessible through library interfaces. To quickly solve the problem, a set of over 5,000 custom records were uploaded (using Microsoft Excel) to Serials Solutions 360 Core, CSI’s serial management system. This solution provided access to current and back-file (perpetual ownership) titles but introduced a number of significant new problems, including duplicate records, records with holdings dates that were invalid at the end of the calendar year, back-file records that were difficult to identify or edit, and unmanageable sets of records for large subscription packages. This article will describe how and why the custom records caused these issues and describe the project that addressed them. The project (ongoing) was designed to fix the problems while maintaining access to all current and back-file titles during the process. A variety of techniques were required. Vendor-provided knowledgebase records were examined, activated (or deactivated), and downloaded. The Overlap Analysis tool of 360 Core was employed to match knowledgebase and custom (local) records. The custom records were manipulated in Excel for examination, editing, and batch deletion. Excel formulas were used to compare the custom records with vendor knowledgebase records and Overlap Analysis results. Finally, extensive manual work was done to delete records, test access links, and find unmatched records. These techniques have been successful. The project also reaped other unexpected access improvements. Other libraries may apply these techniques and strategies to any serial data clean-up. Although journal management technology is rapidly changing, libraries will still need to be able to work with and manipulate data to provide access, understand and manage their holdings, and audit error-prone vendor data. © 2019 Christine McEvilly.","A; Access points; Electronic journals; Metadata; Serials solutions; Technical services; Z lists","article; college; human; library; manual labor; metadata; software","","","","","Amy Stempler, current Chief Librarian; Chief Librarian; Wilma Jones","I thank Wilma Jones, Chief Librarian of the CSI Library at the start of the project and Amy Stempler, current Chief Librarian.

With initiatives to encourage the use and reuse of data in science and business, there is a need to train, through Data Literacy, students and information professionals to make data more applicable and understandable. This research proposes a more appropriate discipline syllabus for ""Data Science"" in undergraduate Librarianship and Archival Science courses in Brazil. Methods: This research is exploratory and qualitative since it consists of selecting and collecting information about the content of the disciplines focused on Data Science in undergraduate courses in Librarianship and Archival Science in Brazil. Results: In some curricula of the 24 universities analyzed and 37 courses identified were found disciplines that may address Data Science in some way. Thus, in the Brazilian context, the most assertive action would be to include the theme ""Data Literacy"" in the context of the ""Data Science"" disciplines. Conclusions: We identified six undergraduate courses on Data Science and a lack of literature on Data Literacy, especially in Portuguese. This may be linked to the lack of disciplines, as it is still a little-discussed approach in the Information Science academic environment. The need to include Data Literacy in undergraduate courses in Brazil was perceived. © 2023, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina.

The enthusiastic embrace of AI in research is tempered by a pervasive concern over the potential for data fabrication, which can significantly compromise ethical standards and academic integrity. There is an urgent need to understand corresponding opportunities, challenges, and dangers. Some aspects of the use of AI tools for different stages of the research lifecycle are considered, and the main advantages and risks are analyzed. Conclusions. AI has the potential to drive innovation and progress in a wide range of fields and possesses significant potential to propel academia and librarianship into both exhilarating and challenging new frontiers. While AI-powered tools represent major advancements and potential to significantly impact academia, scholarly research, publishing, and university libraries. Privacy and bias are just two examples of the ethical considerations that need to be made. © T. O. Yaroshenko, O. I.

This feature column, written by Nosheen Fatima Warraich and Kanwai Ameen, focuses on academic libraries in Pakistan, as the workplace setting; but the research also has implication for the management of library human resources in other contexts and in other countries. Reading this contribution caused me to think about the issues relating to human resource management in a broader global context. This article is a timely reminder that library workplaces are pretty much the same across the world—something I was reminded of recently when I spent some time at an academic library in Malaysia. Local context and issues are important in any consideration of library human resource challenges and opportunities with local factors (such as enterprise agreements, workforce composition, etc.) never far from the focus of library leaders. However, leaving aside local context, library workplaces are also impacted by global factors (including information and communications technologies, global economic conditions, etc.). More so than ever before, the challenges and opportunities playing out when it comes to leadership and management of library human resources, have many things in common. This feature column highlights this point well as it brings a nice mix of applied research and professional practice experience. Based on some large scale research, its findings may be helpful to library leaders in contexts beyond Pakistan. I am pleased to feature this contribution to help highlight the global nature of our practice of professional skills in librarianship and the leadership of library human resources. As always, I invite contributions to the column on topics broadly addressing themes or issues for library workers throughout their career lifecycle.

Design-Multiple-choice survey questionnaire. Setting-Not clearly stated. Subjects-193 adults without graduate degrees in librarianship employed in professional positions in academic libraries. Methods-A nineteen-item multiple-choice questionnaire hosted on Select Survey and a previous study by the same authors. Filtering excluded survey respondents who did not currently work in academic libraries, who had graduate degrees in librarianship, or who do not identify as an academic library professional. Main Results-Most of the survey respondents (n=115, 59.9%) had positions in a library prior to pursuing a professional academic library career. Of those with prior library experience, most (n=98, 85.2%) had gained experience in academic library settings. The two top reasons cited for becoming an academic library professional were an interest in employment in academic library settings (n=59, 52.2%) and meeting position requirements (n=54, 47.8%). A fifth of respondents both met the requirements for their position and had an interest in working in academic libraries (n=23, 20.4%). Most respondents had less than five years' experience (n=41, 36.6%) or six to ten years' experience (n=43, 38.4%) in an academic library. Less than half of respondents had became academic library professionals after applying as an external candidate (n=83, 44.6%) and a number of respondents had applied as an internal candidate (n=52, 28%). Several respondents had become academic library professionals because they were promoted, appointed, or recruited within their academic libraries (n=35, 18.8%). Few respondents were actively working on a graduate librarianship degree (n=21, 11.3%) and most expressed that they did not need such a degree (n=112, 67.9%). Those who were pursuing a graduate degree in librarianship did so because of their desire to advance their careers (n=17, 81%). Respondents' current positions were mostly categorized in areas such as administration (n=77, 31.2%), scholarly communications (n=34, 13.8%), technical services (n=27, 10.9%), and information technology (n=20, 8.1%). Conclusion-Having prior experience working in an academic library served as a notable motivating factor for entry into the position of academic library professional. Two main pathways towards obtaining such positions included positions without graduate library degree requirements and the transition of paraprofessionals into professional-level jobs. Most survey respondents noted their lack of interest in pursuing an advanced degree in librarianship, as they did not see the significance of having one. These findings may help library education programs to better understand growing needs in librarian education and prepare the future library workforce to meet these new demands. © 2020 Opuda.","","","","","","","","","Summary data tables-ACRL 2016, (2016); Glynn L., A critical appraisal tool for library and information research, Library Hi Tech, 24, 3, pp. 387-399, (2006); Gremmels G.S., Staffing trends in college and university libraries, Reference Services Review, 41, 2, pp. 233-252, (2013); Oliver A., Prosser E., Choosing academic librarianship: An examination of characteristics and selection criteria, The Journal of Academic Librarianship, 43, 6, pp. 526-531, (2017); Simpson B., Hiring non-MLS librarians: Trends and training implications, Library Leadership & Management, 28, 1, (2013); Zhu L., The role of paraprofessionals in technical services in academic libraries, Library Resources & Technical Services, 56, 3, pp. 127-154, (2012)","E.

However, discourses with a practical application of Critical Theory in librarianship, critical librarianship, or library management and operations are limited. Yet, librarianship underscores efficiency and practicality in service provision with the dominant ideology in librarianship being practicality. Based on Critical Theory and emerging power dynamics in e-services, this chapter presents a discussion on the practical application of Critical Theory in academic libraries. The Web 2.0 technologies have triggered a shift in information seeking and use by empowering the academic library users to seek and use information from nontraditional sources. This shift in information seeking behavior and the resultant power dynamics has an impact on strengthening of the academic library as a public sphere; a public virtual space where people can meet and exchange ideas with the eventual outcome of democratization of knowledge. This chapter analyses the practical implications of power dynamics in academic libraries and the need for realignment of academic library functions to key Critical Success Factors (CSFs) including the role of library management, a focus on librarian power, a focus on user empowerment, creating awareness of the Web 2.0 services, and maximizing the use of Web 2.0 technologies. A proper realignment of the shifting power is necessary and must be pursued as a deliberate strategy by academic libraries to facilitate generation and sharing of information. It concludes by presenting the practical implications of power dynamics in academic libraries and recommendations on dealing with the emerging paradigm shifts. © 2020 Emerald Publishing Limited All rights of reproduction in any form reserved","Academic library; Critical theory; Librarian power; Power dynamics; Public sphere; Web 2.0","","","","","","","","Abram S., Social libraries: The librarian 2.0 phenomenon, Library Resources & Technical Services, 52, 2, pp. 19-22, (2008); Anfinnsen S., Ghinea G., De Cesare S., Web 2.0 and folksonomies in a library context, International Journal of Information Management, 31, 1, pp. 63-70, (2011); Aqil M., Ahmad P., Siddique M.A., Web 2.0 and libraries: Facts or myths, DESIDOC Journal of Library & Information Technology, 31, 5, pp. 395-400, (2012); Beers P.J., Bots P.W.G., Eliciting conceptual models to support interdisciplinary research, Journal of Information Science, 35, 3, pp. 259-278, (2009); Benoit G., Toward a critical theoretic perspective in information systems, The Library Quarterly, 72, 4, pp. 441-471, (2002); Bohman J., Critical theory.

The objectives of this analysis are: map the academic production on the application of IoT technology in libraries since the first discussions about this technology until the year 2018; verify whether the studies are practical or only theoretical; identify the research areas and countries that develop the most studies on this subject; to determine the most common applications in libraries and which technologies are being used; identify successful practical initiatives in libraries. The methodology adopted is the systematic review of international literature available in the Scopus and Web of Science databases. The focus of this bibliographic survey is to identify research on IoT exclusively in the library environment. It is an exploratory research with the purpose of characterizing the scientific production on this subject and the data analysis follows a quanti-qualitative approach. It is concluded that the research of IoT in library is still scarce, with predominance of theoretical studies to the detriment of empirical experiments. The area of Computer Science concentrates the largest number of publications and can benefit from an interdisciplinary partnership with Librarianship and Information Science. © 2020, Escola de Ciencia da Informacao da UFMG.

Institutions are recruiting individuals with strong backgrounds in geospatial technologies for some positions.

It is necessary to describe the general developments in information technology in libraries to place the changes affecting music libraries in context but efforts are made to draw out the music examples at all times. Written as a celebration of the last 50 years of International Association of Music Libraries (IAML) (UK), the chapter makes particular reference to the work of the UK Branch and, where relevant, to its parent association IAML. It attempts to draw examples of developments and projects in music from all sectors of the library community but at particularly significant stages the academic community has led the way. In 1953 when IAML(UK) was formed, computers were far away from most peoples’ lives and they had no direct impact on music librarianship. © International Association of Music Libraries UK, 2003.","","","","","","","","","Oxford English Dictionary online version-, (2001); Leavitt H.J., Whisler T.L., Management in the 1980s, Harvard Business Review, 36, 6, pp. 41-48, (1958); Branson B.H., Mechanical help in the study of folk song, Journal of American Folklore, 62, pp. 81-86, (1949); Bauer-Mengelberg S., The Ford-Columbia input language, Musicology and the Computer, pp. 48-52, (1970); Bernstein L.F., Olive J., Computers and the 16th-century chanson, Computers and the Humanities, 3, 3, pp. 153-160, (1969); Barlow H., Morgenstern S., A Dictionary of Musical Themes, (1948); Kelly P., The Use of Spreadsheet Software in UK Public Libraries, (1989); Brook B., Utilization of data processing techniques in music documentation, Fontes Artis Musicae, 12, 2-3, pp. 112-119, (1965); Brook B., Utilization of data processing techniques in music documentation, Fontes Artis Musicae, 12, 2-3, (1965); Stubley P., BLCMP: A Guide for Librarians and Systems Managers, pp. 19-20, (1988); Sumner Spalding C., Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules: British Text, (1967); Miller M., Music libraries, British Librarianship and Information Science 1971-1975, pp. 239-245, (1977); Rules for Descriptive Cataloging in the Library of Congress; Lubetzky S., Cataloging Rules and Principles: A Critique of the A.L.A.

In art and architecture libraries, special collections can include a variety of materials such as rare books, trade catalogs, builder’s guides, graphic and visual materials, artists’ books, archival records in many formats, and files of ephemera. Public service issues relating to the administration of special collections housed in an architecture branch library (and its off-site repositories) will be addressed.

Based on literature review on the methodology system this paper selects ten core journals in library science that is Journal of Library Science in China Library and Information Service Journal of Academic Libraries Document Information & Knowledge Journal of the National Library of China Library Development Library Tribune Research on Library Science Library & Information Library Journal. Then we code and calculate the research methods used in each paper. It reveals the application of research methods in library science in China by automatic extraction and manual coding. Results show that the methodology system of library science consists of three levels general scientific methods specialized research methods and interdisciplinary research methods. Besides various research methods at different methodological levels complement each other in applying library science research themes with Chinese characteristics. In the contemporary Chinese context the general research methods apply mainly to the following aspects 1 the transformation and development of libraries in China 2 the development of Chinese librarianship 3 the review reflection and reform of library science education in China 4 the development of China’s folk libraries township libraries and libraries in poverty areas 5 the construction of service system and governance model of public libraries in China. The general research methods and specialized research methods apply mainly to the following aspects 1 research on the process of public library law in China 2 research progress of China’s public digital culture construction and service 3 the application of modern information technology in China’s libraries 4 the evaluation and empirical research of library service quality 5 informetric and scientific evaluation research. The general research methods and interdisciplinary research methods combined apply mainly to the following aspects 1 the further study on the theory and practice of library reading promotion 2 marketing strategies and promotion practices for library services 3 study of information behaviour and personalized services from a user perspective. Based on Chinese practice the various research methods at different levels of methodology complement each other in the specific application of library science research in the Chinese context. They are of great significance in solving Chinese problems and spreading Chinese voices. 1 tab. 68 refs. © 2021, Editorial Office of Journal of Library Science in China.

The ethics of care is a feminist philosophical perspective that sees in the personal a new way to approach other facets of life, including the political and the professional. Care, in this context, is broadly construed as “a species of activity that includes everything we do to maintain, contain, and repair our ‘world’ so that we can live in it as well as possible” (Fisher & Tronto, 1990, p. 40). Joan Tronto outlined four elements of care: attentiveness, responsibility, competence, and responsiveness, and highlighted the value of care beyond the domestic sphere (1993). The ethics of care values care and relationships as instructive ways of framing and examining work, and has been applied in diverse disciplines, including education, nursing, social work, and even business. Several LIS professionals have considered the ethics of care in the context of library technologies (Henry, 2016) and digital humanities (Dohe, 2019), among others. The ethics of care can also provide inspiration for OA librarians as we think about the scope and nature of our work. What could open access librarians learn from the ethics of care? How might our practice change or evolve with the ethics of care as an underpinning philosophy? Who do we include in our circle of care while we undertake our work? The ethics of care provides a more expansive way to think about OA librarianship. © 2021 Bradley.","","","","","","","","","Adema J., Moore S.

These changes have in turn given rise to new models of librarianship centered on principles of participation, interaction, and collaboration. Over the last decade, academic libraries have eagerly adopted social media as a means of enhancing services and connecting with a new generation of users. But how exactly has this technology changed libraries? In what ways has the social web transformed library services or our relationships with users? This article attempts to assess the impact of social media on academic libraries in the United States through a review of the literature published since 2005. In particular, it looks at how academic libraries have used social media to improve or develop new services. By comparing published case studies with the theoretical literature, this article seeks to separate theory from practice and determine the extent to which the social web has transformed library practice. The author concludes that, despite several noteworthy examples, the majority of social library applications ultimately fail to live up to the transformative potential promised within the literature and that this failure may have more to do with philosophical rather than technical limitations. © 2018 Joseph Deodato.","academic libraries; social media; user-generated content; Web 2.0","","","","","","","","Ackerman M., Providing Social Interaction in the Digital Library, Proceedings of the Digital Libraries ‘94: First Annual Conference on the Theory and Practice of digital libraries, pp. 198-200, (1994); Al-Daihani S., Abrahams A., A Text Mining Analysis of Academic Libraries' Tweets, Journal of Academic Librarianship, 42, 2, pp. 135-143, (2016); Alperin J.P., Ask Not What Altmetrics Can Do for You, But What Altmetrics Can Do for Developing Countries, Bulletin of the Association for Information Science and Technology, 39, 4, pp. 18-21, (2013); Arnold T., Sampson W., Preserving the Voices of Revolution: Examining the Creation and Preservation of a Subject-centered Collection of Tweets from the Eighteen Days in Egypt, American Archivist, 77, 2, pp. 510-533, (2014); Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education, (2015); Barnes N.G., Lescault A.M., “The Fortune 500 and Social Media.” University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, (2014); Blyberg J., 11 Reasons Why Library 2.0 Eists and Matters.” blyberg.net, (2006); Bobish G., Participation and Pedagogy: Connecting the Social Web to ACRL Learning Outcomes, Journal of Academic Librarianship, 37, 1, pp. 54-63, (2011); Bodnar J., Doshi A., Asking the Right Questions: A Critique of Facebook, Social Media, and Libraries, Public Services Quarterly, 7, 3, pp. 102-110, (2011); Casey M., Savastinuk L.C., Library 2.0: Service for the Next-Generation Library, Library Journal, 131, 14, pp. 40-42, (2006); Charnigo L., Barnett-Ellis P., Checking Out Facebook.com: The Impact of a Digital Trend on Academic Libraries, Information Technology & Libraries, 26, 1, pp. 23-34, (2007); Chu M., Nalani Meulemans Y., The Problems and Potential of MySpace and Facebook Usage in Academic Libraries, Internet Reference Services Quarterly, 13, 1, pp. 69-85, (2008); Chu S.K., Du H.S., Social Networking Tools for Academic Libraries, Journal of Librarianship & Information Science, 45, 1, pp. 64-75, (2013); Connell R.S., Academic Libraries, Facebook and MySpace, and Student Outreach: A Survey of Student Opinion, Portal: Libraries & the Academy, 9, 1, pp. 25-36, (2009); Cowell A.E., Social Media at the College of New Jersey Library, In the Library with the Lead Pipe, (2017); Crawford W., Library 2.0 and ‘Library 2.0.’, Cites & Insights, 6, 2, pp. 1-32, (2006); Del Bosque D., Leif S.A., Skarl S., Libraries Atwitter: Trends in Academic Library Tweeting, Reference Services Review, 40, 2, pp. 199-213, (2012); De Rosa C., Cantrell J., Carlson M., Gallagher P., Hawk J., Sturtz C., Perceptions of Libraries 2010: Context and Community.” OCLC, (2011); Devare M., Corson-Rikert J., Caruso B., Lowe B., Chiang K., McCue J., VIVO: Connecting People, Creating a Virtual Life Sciences Community, D-Lib Magazine, 13, 7-8, (2007); Dickson A., Holley R.P., Social Networking in Academic Libraries: The Possibilities and the Concerns, New Library World, 111, 11-12, pp. 468-479, (2010); Emmelhainz C., Rigby M., Following the Yik Yak: Using Social Media Observations to Understand Student Needs on College Campuses, In the Library with the Lead Pipe, (2017); Farkas M., Your Stuff, Their space, American Libraries, 38, 11, (2007); Farkas M., Participatory Technologies, Pedagogy 2.0 and Information Literacy, Library Hi Tech, 30, 1, pp. 82-94, (2012); Galligan F., Dyas-Correia S., Altmetrics: Rethinking the Way We Measure, Serials Review, 39, 1, pp. 55-61, (2013); Gerolimos M., Academic Libraries on Facebook: An Analysis of Users' Comments, D-Lib Magazine, 17, 11, (2011); Hank C., Communications in Blogademia: An Assessment of Scholar Blogs' Attributes and Functions, New Review of Information Networking, 18, 2, pp. 51-69, (2013); Harrison A., Burress R., Velasquez S., Schreiner L., Social Media Use in Academic Libraries: A Phenomenological Study, Journal of Academic Librarianship, 43, 3, pp. 248-256, (2017); Hartman A., Fragments of History: Identifying Medieval Manuscript Fragments through Crowdsourcing, Archival Outlook, pp. 8-9, (2014); Holley R., Crowdsourcing: How and Why Should Libraries Do It?, D-Lib Magazine, 16, 3-4, (2010); Holmberg K., Huvila I., Kronqvist-Berg M., Widen-Wulff G., What is Library 2.0?, Journal of Documentation, 66, 4, pp. 668-681, (2008); Howard J., Posting Your Latest Article?

The purpose of this study is to identify the determinants of EBL adoption and implementation in library acquisition decision of electronic resources. The Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) model, Innovation Diffusion Theory (IDT) theory and EBL model were used to form the research framework in order to investigate the adoption and implementation of evidence-based acquisition (EBA). Questionnaires were used as data collection tool. Data were collected from 250 respondents comprising librarians from academic, public and special libraries. The data were analyzed descriptively using Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS) v24. The assessment of the measurement and structural model was executed using Smart-PLS (SEM) 3.0. The reflective model was found to be valid and reliable with the Cronbach's Alpha above 0.70, CR value and AVE of 0.80-0.90. Fornell-Larcker Criterion and Item Cross-loading recordings revealed that the constructs did not discriminate each other. Path coefficient analysis was performed to test the hypothesis in the identification of significant relationship that resulted in Relative Advantage, Compatibility and Top Management Support as the determinants of EBA of electronic resources Although no significant relationship was found between EBL Adoption and Implementation, an indication of practice was recorded in the level of implementation analysis. Further action and future research for libraries were suggested.

Accordingly, there is an urgent need for assessing the level of digital skills among librarians at academic libraries in Jordan. It is also important to investigate the influence of digital skills on technology acceptance among librarians in Jordan. A questionnaire was developed and used to collect the required data from university libraries in Jordan. The results indicate a high level of digital skills among the librarians. The result also shows that financial issues are the main challenges that librarians face to obtain the required skills. Most importantly, the level of digital skills positively influences the librarians’ acceptance and use of technology in academic libraries in Jordan. It was noted that factors such as sex, age, experience, specialization, and library type had no effect on the results. Findings of this research will help to explore the skills and competencies needed by information professionals and act as a guideline for competency development and curriculum updates in Librarianship and Information Science schools at an international level. © The Author(s) 2020.","academic libraries; digital libraries; digital literacy; Digital skills; technology acceptance","","","","","","","","Adeleke A.A., Digitization capacity and skills of academic libraries in Nigeria, (2016); Alharbi S., Drew S., Using the technology acceptance model in understanding academics’ behavioural intention to use learning management systems, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, 5, 1, pp. 143-155, (2014); ALA’s core competences lf Librarianship, (2009); 2018 top trends in academic libraries: A review of the trends and issues affecting academic libraries in higher education, College & Research Libraries News (C&RL News), 79, 6, pp. 286-300, (2018); Baro E.E., Obaro O.G., Aduba E.D., An assessment of digital literacy skills and knowledge-based competencies among librarians working in university libraries in Africa, Digital Library Perspectives, 35, 3-4, pp. 172-192, (2019); Bawden D., Vilar P., Zabukovec V., Education and training for digital librarians, Aslib Proceedings: New Information Perspectives, 57, 1, pp. 85-98, (2005); Bhatti R., Nadeem M., Assessing training needs of LIS professionals: A prerequisite for developing training programs in university libraries of Pakistan, Chinese Librarianship: An International Electronic Journal, 37, 2, pp. 47-62, (2014); Campbell J.D., Changing a cultural icon: The academic library as a virtual destination, EDUCAUSE Review, 41, 1, pp. 16-18, (2006); Chinien C., Boutin F., Defining Essential Digital Skills in the Canadian Workplace, (2011); Choi Y., Rasmussen E., What is needed to educate future digital librarians?, D-Lib Magazine, 12, 9, pp. 12-21, (2006); Choi Y., Rasmussen E., What qualifications and skills are important for digital librarian positions in academic libraries?

Academic libraries must respond to environmental changes by acquiring new capabilities. Using the strategic management concept of dynamic capabilities, this study investigates the relationship between the dynamic capabilities of an academic library and its overall performance. This study uses the structural equation modelling (SEM) technique and develops a new model, the DCAL model, for academic libraries to build these new capabilities. The analysis of the DCAL model indicates a positive and significant relationship between the three core capabilities, searching, seizing, and transforming, and the overall performance of the academic library. This study also identifies activities, scouting for new technologies that can be adapted by academic libraries, piloting projects, analysing large amounts of data, balancing routine work with innovative work, and the need for academic librarians to build capabilities to perform those activities to succeed in their future roles. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Academic librarianship; Dynamic capabilities; Searching; Seizing; Transforming","","","","","","","","Adekoya C.O., Adedimeji A.A., Enhancing library performance by exploiting the potentials of disruptive innovations, VINE Journal of Information and Knowledge Management Systems., (2021); Ahmad K., JianMing Z., Rafi M., An analysis of academic librarians competencies and skills for implementation of big data analytics in libraries, Data Technologies and Applications, 53, pp. 201-216, (2019); Bagozzi R.P., Yi Y., On the evaluation of structural equation models, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 16, pp. 74-94, (1988); Blummer B., Kenton J.M., Academic libraries and student learning outcomes, Performance Measurement and Metrics, 19, 1, pp. 75-87, (2018); Chan D.L.H., Soong S.C., Strategic repositioning in a dynamic environment, Library Management, 32, pp. 22-36, (2011); Chigwada J.P., Chisita C.T., Introduction to the fourth industrial revolution and libraries, Examining the impact of industry 4.0 on academic libraries, pp. 3-15, (2021); Chong E.E., Nazim A., Ahmad S.B., A comparison between individual confirmatory factor analysis and pooled confirmatory factor analysis: An analysis of library service quality, a case study at a public university in Terengganu, International Journal of Engineering Science and Innovative Technology, 3, pp. 110-116, (2014); Choshaly S.H., Mirabolghasemi M., Using SEM-PLS to assess users satisfaction of library service quality: Evidence from Malaysia, Library Management, 40, pp. 240-250, (2019); Day G.S., Schoemaker P.J.H., How to sense and seize opportunities - and transform your organization.

Since 1996, by which time the standards that determine how hospitals acquire accreditation changed, many hospitals have been acquiring accreditation without a qualified medical librarian on site. For that reason, it has become even more important that health care professionals, doctors, nurses, and other clinicians learn to access and evaluate quality information as an integral part of their academic training. Medical clinicians now must begin their careers with strong research skills. These skills must be attained during their academic matriculation, and studies in the field of librarianship have shown that departmental outreach hours are an extremely effective way to promote library services to university students and faculty. Other methods, such as technology applications, are useful but have their limitations. This paper reviews current literature on the vital importance of in-person outreach to future health care professionals and illustrates these insights with a discussion of my personal experiences as a health sciences librarian at Georgia State University. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","academic libraries; embedded librarian; field librarians; health sciences; information literacy; library best practices; library liaison; nursing; outreach programs; patient safety; public health; subject specialists; user needs","","","","","","","","Altman L.K., Volunteer in asthma study dies after inhaling drug, New York Times, (2001); Altman L.K., FDA faults Johns Hopkins over process in fatal study, New York Times, (2001); Avery S., Hahn J., Zilic M., Beyond consultation: A new model for librarian's office hours, Public Services Quarterly, 4, 3, pp. 187-206, (2008); Banick C., RX for medical libraries, Library Journal, 130, 19, pp. 32-34, (2005); Bauerlein M., The dumbest generation: How the digital age stupefies young Americans and jeopardizes our future (or, don't trust anyone under 30), (2008); Fama J., Berryman D., Harger N., Julian P., Peterson N., Spinner M., Varney J., Inside outreach: A challenge for health sciences librarians, Journal of the Medical Library Association, 93, 3, pp. 327-337, (2005); Hider P.N., Griffin G., Walker M., Coughlan E., The information-seeking behavior of clinical staff in a large health care organization, Journal of the Medical Library Association, 97, 1, pp. 46-49, (2009); Accreditation manual for hospitals, (1988); Accreditation manual for hospitals: Volume 1, standards, (1992); Comprehensive accreditation manual for hospitals, (2010); Lee J., Hayden K., MacMillan D., I wouldn't have asked for help if I had to go to the library"": Reference services on site, Issues in Science and Technology Librarianship, 41, (2004); Paradise A., Why the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations should add new regulations regarding libraries, Journal of the Medical Library Association, 92, 2, pp. 166-168, (2004); Perkins E., Johns Hopkins tragedy, Information Today, 18, 8, (2001); Peros J., Face time, Information Outlook, 9, 12, pp. 25-27, (2005); Scherrer C.S., Reference librarians' perceptions of the issues they face as academic health information professionals, Journal of the Medical Library Association, 92, 2, pp. 226-232, (2004)","T.

She works between the world of business and librariesnegotiating, haggling, troubleshooting. When academic libraries first offered databases, however, the associated responsibilities were usually attached to another position, such as a reference or systems librarian. As technology developed, allowing more diverse electronic resources (ER) to be made available, the responsibilities of the people managing those products became more complex.

But now, Chemical Librarianship: Challenges and Opportunities will show you how you can adapt your methods to the rapidly evolving demands of twentieth-century chemical researchers without sacrificing your high standards of service. Altogether, this comprehensive overview helps you see the major role librarians still play in information education and gives you a broad assortment of strategies for coping with the accelerated demands of today's shifting electronic research environment. In Chemical Librarianship, you'll read about the revolutionary pedagogical experiments of librarians, teachers, computer specialists, and graduate students. You'll see how those experiments have altered the way they approach research--for the better--and how you can make positive adjustments in your own successful formulae. Individual chapters discuss: Librarians as teachers. The pros and cons of integrating/separating chemical information courses. Faculty and computing staff--partnership at the University of Florida. Yale University's experiment with The Electronic Seminar System. The evolution of electronic journals. The most recent trends in academic serial collection. Take 100 mg of quickly changing research technology, a drop of increased enrollment, and 250 cc's of faculty requests, shake it up in an Erlenmeyer flask, heat it at 200 degrees Celsius, and what do you get? An explosion? A disaster? If these are your fears, put them away. Open up Chemical Librarianship and let some of the most informed experts on research and technology help you and your staff find just the right chemistry. © 1997 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

The paper conducted an examination of the mobile content and services provided by the libraries of the member institutions of the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada (AUCC). Based on this examination, the paper describes the current state of mobile librarianship in Canadian academic libraries. A review of the literature places the investigation in its broader context. Only 14 percent of AUCC libraries currently advertise some type of mobile web presence, with mobile web sites being prevalent over downloadable apps. Examples of content and services are highlighted to illustrate current trends and to provide insight into future directions for developing mobile services. This study raises awareness of the importance of mobile technology for academic libraries and the need to address the lack of mobile content and services provided by most Canadian post-secondary institutions. The paper also identifies best practices exhibited by the surveyed libraries. This is the first exploration of this type into how academic libraries in Canada have responded to the mobile environment. The value of this research is in helping libraries identify and address shortcomings in the mobile content and services they provide, and in highlighting efforts by libraries to address their users' needs in this area. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Academic libraries;

While many perceive gaming as a new library service, gaming services have been part of librarianship since the nineteenth century through chess clubs. During the Great Depression, libraries supported patrons with puzzle contests and developed circulating toy and game collections. Academic libraries built game collections for research and classroom needs, while school libraries collected and facilitated educational games to aid teachers. Video games have been used in libraries to help patrons learn to use technology and to bring groups of patrons together to enjoy shared experiences. The goal of this article is to demonstrate the different ways in which libraries have used games, toys, and puzzles over the last 150 years through both collections and services. © 2013 by The University of Chicago.

The author manually reviewed the content of all journal issues from 2006 through 2011 using the Emerald web site. The information reviewed was number of articles per issue; author affiliations; article format; and article titles, abstracts, and keywords. The type, size, and location of author institutions were confirmed using institutions' official web sites as necessary. The paper finds that Reference Services Review has published an average of 40 articles per year. The majority of articles focus on topics in information literacy and reference services, with consistent coverage of emerging technologies, working with diverse populations, library space, and management. The majority of contributors are affiliated with large academic institutions in the USA, with some representation from liberal arts colleges, public libraries, community colleges, and international authors. This analysis consolidates data on the volume, focus, and authorship of Reference Services Review as the journal reaches its 41st year of publication.

With the emergence of new media and technology, the concept of books has expanded to include information of all types and in multiple formats: eBooks, DVDs, videogames, electronic databases, et cetera. Meanwhile, the idea of community has stayed the same. For example, public libraries primarily serve communities defined by geographic lines; academic libraries serve their campus communities. In non-profit, medical or corporate libraries, communities are defined by their organization's particular mission. However, now that virtual worlds are becoming mainstream, librarians are redefining community, just as they redefined books. With the emergence of virtual worlds, librarians are encountering virtual patrons, and communities defined by virtual lines that defy physical boundaries. This chapter discusses the librarians and organizations that are moving librarianship into virtual communities, as well as the first library initiatives in online worlds. © 2012, IGI Global.","","","","","","","","","Ashford R., Should academic librarians assist in virtual worlds?, Librarian by Design, (2009); Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education, (2000); Bell L., Trueman R.B., Virtual Worlds, Real Libraries: Librarians and Educators in Second Life and Other Multi-user Virtual Environments, (2008); Bourhis A., Dube L., Jacob R., The success of virtual communities of practice: The leadership factor, Electronic Journal of Knowledge Management, 3, 1, pp. 23-34, (2005); Virtual World Landmark Center, (2010); Czarnecki K., Virtual environments and K-12 education, MultiMedia & Internet@Schools, 15, 4, pp. 14-17, (2008); Godin S., Tribes: We Need You to Lead Us, (2008); Goodstein A., What would madison avenue do?

On the basis of a review of the scholarly, governmental, and professional literatures and websites, the fields of public librarianship and community informatics were compared along two dimensions: (1) institutional histories, including perspectives on emergent information and communications technologies and engagement in the public policy process; and (2) academic affiliations and major theoretical approaches, including significant research initiatives and findings of relevance to public access computing services. The purpose of this comparison is to contribute to and expand upon our knowledge of the differences and similarities between these two communities and how best to use this information to inform future research and practice. The focus of this analysis is on the Canadian context, and the comparison between both communities along the dimensions of political engagement and dominant epistemological orientations distinguishes it from previous research in the field. © The Canadian Journal of Information and Library Science.","","","","","","","","","Adams K., Conflicting values: Librarianship, public policy and telecommunications, Understanding Telecommunications and Public Policy: A Guide for Libraries, (1998); Adria M., Talking about technology adoption in the public library, Cracin, (2007); Alkalimat A., Williams K., Social capital and cyberpower in the African-American community: A case study of a community technology centre in the dual-city, Community Informatics: Shaping Computer-mediated Social Relations, pp. 177-204, (2001); Babe R., Telecommunications in Canada, (1990); Bakes R., Maximizing the Value of Library CAP Sites: Saskatchewan Perspectives and Recommendations, (2003); Balka E., Peterson B., Citizenship and public access Internet use: Beyond the field of dreams, Community Practice in the Networked Society: Local Action/global Interaction, pp. 139-154, (2004); Barney D., Communication Technology, (2005); Buildings, Books, and Bytes: Libraries and Communities in the Digital Age, (1996); Bertot J., Jaeger P., Langa L., McClure C., Public access computing and Internet access in public libraries: The role of public libraries in e-government and emergency situations, First Monday, 11, (2006); Birdsall W., The Myth of the Electronic Library: Librarianship and Social Change in America, (1994); The Internet and the ideology of information technology, INET'96 Conference, (1996); Policy and players: The telecommunications policy environment, Understanding Telecommunications and Public Policy: A Guide for Libraries, pp. 117-141, (1998); Policy participation on the Canadian information highway, First Monday, 4, (1999); Birdsall W., A political economy of librarianship?, Progressive Librarian, 18, pp. 1-8, (2001); Bishop A., Bruce B., Community informatics: Integrating action, research and learning, Bulletin of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 31, 6, pp. 6-10, (2005); Boyd-Barrett O., Globalization, cyberspace and the public sphere, Community Practice in the Network Society: Local Action/global Interaction, pp. 23-35, (2004); Buchwald C., Canadian universality policy and the information infrastructure: Past lessons, future directions, Working Paper No. 3, (1996); Buckland M., The heritage of public librarianship, New Frontiers in Public Library Research, (2005); Caidi N., Chien E., Broad-based study: Community networks and libraries, Paper Presented at CRACIN Workshop #2, pp. 26-27, (2004); Campbell B., The politics of universal access, Understanding Telecommunications and Public Policy: A Guide for Libraries, pp. 51-70, (1998); In"" versus ""with"" the community: Using a community approach to public library services, Feliciter, 51, 6, pp. 271-273, (2005); Position Statement on Information and Telecommunication Access Principles, (1994); Written Submission to the Telecommunications Policy Review Panel, (2005); Canadian Research Alliance for Community Innovation and Networking, (2007); Chase T., Characterization of Free-nets in the United States and Canada: Facing History and Managing the Future, (1995); Clement A., Aspinall J., Viseu A., Kennedy T., Public access, personal privacy and media interweaving in everyday Internet experiences: Exploring current policy concerns via a ""neighbourhood ethnography., Seeking Convergence in Policy and Practice: Communications in the Public Interest, 2, pp. 247-284, (2004); Clement A., Hurrell C., Information/communications Rights As A New Environmentalism?

The mixed methods methodology focused on assessing the embedded librarian's impact upon the information literacy competency of the participants. Results support the documented literature by indicating that embedded librarians are of value to online students. The course instructor's experience with the design, development, implementation, and evaluation of the embedded librarian project are emphasized in the presentation, providing unique faculty insight into collaborating with librarians. Recommendations for the assessment of embedded librarian projects include the need for future studies to investigate various contexts and the use of other methodologies to provide stronger empirical evidence. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","assessment;

Why does the gap exist? What are Library and Information Science (LIS) schools doing to entice, attract, enroll, motivate and train science librarians? What are the professional associations doing to promote the cause of science librarianship? What are academic and research libraries doing to retain and stop science librarians from invading or migrating to other niches.

This study determines that, at the national level, the ACRL-STS clearly has as many as three times the members working in these settings. This begs the question as to why SLA is nonetheless named by survey respondents as an affiliation at least half the time, or by those who otherwise respond indicating an involvement with an SLA meeting or listserv at a rate that would be higher than this national ratio would predict. This author theorizes that three factors might very well play a role in priming this participation and subsequent recall of activities in favor of SLA. The three parts of his theory include the respondent's proximity to academic SLA STM librarians, an awareness of the general success of SLA members in attainment of elective professional office, and success in SLA member recruitment by elite institutions. An analysis of SLA membership rolls indicates that academic SLA STM librarians are indeed very widely dispersed around the country, giving them opportunities to become well-known in many academic library consortia. Additionally, academic SLA STM librarians are highly active within SLA and frequently hold key offices on local and national levels, an achievement that is likely to be noticed by colleagues in academic librarianship. Finally, the greatest concentration of academic SLA STM librarians in all regions is at any of that area's universities that are rated as being one of America's most selective or ranked in the top 50 nationally, enhancing a possible connection of SLA membership with occupational success in a way that also encouraged participation in some exploration or participation in SLA activities or functions. © 2008 by The Haworth Press.

The physics repository, arXiv, and E-Lis, a repository for documents on librarianship, information science and technology, are two examples. In this paper, we propose the framework for the development of an International Repository for Engineering and Technology Education (IRETE). IRETE will be a repository for the archiving of information related to engineering and technical education. It will focus on being a repository for the world-wide community of scholars and teachers in engineering education, allowing them access to documents and bibliographic records that have not been properly entered into existing databases, catalogs or web engines such as Yahoo and Google. This information is essential for the improvement of teaching and research in engineering and technology education. The benefits of a repository like IRETE go beyond engineering education. Educators in other areas would have access to information on curriculum development, course design, and the recruitment and retention of students. IRETE will utilize an operating system like Fedora with the metadata of records, following established standards such as Dublin. It will also adapt the most current protocol of the Open Archives Initiative (OAI). IRETE is a conceptual framework for a repository that would benefit engineering educators world wide.","Databases; Engineering education; Engineering repositories","Bibliographic retrieval systems; Curricula; Database systems; Education; Electronic document exchange; Internet; Social networking (online); Teaching; Curriculum development; Engineering and technology; Engineering educators; Engineering repository; Open archives initiatives; Professional institution; Science and Technology; Teaching and researches; Engineering education","","","","","","","National Academy of Engineering of the National Academies, Educating the Engineer of 2020: Adapting Engineering Education to the New Century, (2005); Powell J., Engineering education, Using the Engineering Literature, pp. 269-285, (2006); Jesiek B., Et al., Engineering education research: Discipline, community, or field?, J.

Data sources included a questionnaire and think-aloud cognitive tasks. Analysis revealed that the one-credit course was insufficient for deepening preservice teachers' information literacy skills, leading to recommendations to enhance and expand instruction and recommendations for future study.

It also seeks to analyse the role of professional bodies, especially in India, in preparing librarians to meet these challenges. Design/methodology/approach: Part I of this paper on emerging trends in academic librarianship at the global level has been consolidated from the literature that has discussed this problem in various forums, and from personal experience. Part II principally assesses the role played by library associations in preparing professionals to face the challenges offered by trends that emerge from time to time. This is done with the aid of a case study of the Indian Association of Special Libraries & Information Centres (IASLIC), Kolkata (India). A questionnaire and personal interviews were utilised to gather information and opinions. Findings: It is found that the modern academic librarian, besides the common attributes, should be technology-savvy and eager to learn and adopt any technology development for the benefit of users. Regular updating of professionals is sine qua non. In the Indian context, it is found that professional bodies like IASLIC did play a yeoman's role in bringing India to the forefront of global librarianship. It is concluded that India does need a well-laid out policy and programmes of updating and equipping its librarians continuously and can benefit from the experiences of ALA and CILIP. Originality/value: This is the first time a study of IASLIC has been conducted from the angle of its role in meeting the new challenges posed by ICT. This study should benefit all professional bodies in India in their education programme. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Academic libraries; Communication technologies; Continuing professional development; India; Librarianship; Professional education","","","","","","","","Johnson L., Levine A., Smith R., Stone S., The 2010 Horizon Report, (2010); Ambili K.S., Gokul A.N., Paradigm shifts in LIS profession and implications of the National Knowledge Commission (NKC) recommendations, Library Profession in Search of a New Paradigm: Proceedings of the 23rd National Seminar of IASLIC, Kolkata, pp. 3-11, (2009); IASLIC: Challenges and Prospects, (2007); Harbo O., Bowden R., Development of the profession: A history of the IFLA Section for Education & Training from 1974 to 2003, 21, (2010); Kohl D.F., Towards a new understanding of the library mission: Vision and implementation, Globalizing Academic Libraries: Vision 2020, Proceedings of the International Conference on Academic Libraries, Part I, Mittal, New Delhi, pp. 1-8, (2008)","V.

Cuza University, Iaşi, Romania","This paper takes a fresh look at the transformative events that marked the development of the library scene at the twenty-fifth anniversary of regime change in Romania. It examines their significance for the country’s postcommunist trajectories by linking the past, present, and future of library development. Libraries of all types have been affected in either a positive or negative way during the past twenty-five years. Currently, there is no strategy at the national level to coordinate library development or to establish priorities and directions for growth. Due to significant financial aid from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the public library sector has made significant progress, especially in the diversification of computer-based services offered to the communities they serve. Higher education has witnessed the advent of private universities, although oftentimes not endowed with adequate libraries. The public and academic library network has embraced the new information and communications technology. School libraries, although high in numbers, have remained anchored in the past, with a few exceptions. Many special libraries have disappeared, along with their parent institutions. Despite its moving into a modern edifice, the National Library of Romania is yet to identify its role, goals, mission, and vision for the information society. Two major library associations have elevated librarianship to a professional status, but they act independently of each other and their programs never intersect. Library legislation and other laws provide the legal framework for libraries, the publishing industry, and the information and communications field. Despite the progress reported by libraries, usage continues to remain very low. The public’s perception of libraries’ role in society has not yet crystallized. Insufficient funding prevents Romanian libraries from performing at the same parameters as their counterparts in economically developed countries. © 2015, Johns Hopkins University Press.

The review will also report on published outcomes and future research needs of embedded librarian programs. Methods-A search of current literature was conducted and summarized searching PubMed, CINAHL, Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts (EBSCO), Academic Search Complete, and ERIC (EBSCO) through August 23, 2012. Articles were selected for inclusion in the review if they reported research findings related to embedded librarianship, if they provided unique case reports about embedded librarian programs, or if they provided substantive editorial comments on the topic. Relevant study findings were assessed for quality and presented in tabular and narrative form. Results - Currently, there is disparity in how embedded librarianship is being defined and used in common practice, ranging from embedding an online component into a single course to full physical and cultural integration into an academic college or business unit of an organization. Activities of embedded librarians include creating course integrated instruction modules for either face-to-face or online courses, providing in depth research assistance to students or faculty, and co-locating within colleges or customer units via office hours for a few hours to all hours per week. Several case reports exist in the recent literature. Few high quality research studies reporting outcomes of librarians or library programs labeled as embedded exist at this point. Some evidence suggests that embedded librarians are effective with regards to student learning of information literacy objectives. Surveys suggest that both students and faculty appreciate embedded librarian services. Conclusion - Most published accounts discuss librarians embedding content and ready access to services in an online course management system. A few notable cases describe the physical and cultural integration of librarians into the library user environs. Future research using valid quantitative methods is needed to explore the impact of large scale, customized, embedded programs. © Schulte.","","","","","","","","","Bartnik L., The embedded academic librarian: The subject specialist moves into the discipline college, Kentucky Libraries, 71, 3, pp. 4-9, (2007);

It aims to look at the influences which their local origins have had on them as well as the commonality which the internationalisation of the library profession has brought on them. Design/methodology/approach: The paper seeks inferences about the impact of globalisation on the world of academic librarianship. It looks at commonality of experience past, present and future. The process of investigation was to pose a number of questions regarding what academic libraries are, their role in academic landscapes, the impact of globalising technologies and the future of the book. Findings: The findings are that there is a commonality of experience and that modern library technologies have changed the nature of professional practice significantly in recent decades; that indigenous traditions of practice at local level are being replaced by an integration of internationally shared experience. Originality/value: The paper should interest those researching the future of academic libraries, comparative developments in academic libraries worldwide, the future of repository storage in the face of digitisation and the future of academic landscapes. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Academic libraries; Globalization; Ireland; Mexico","","","","","","","","Anderson M., Access to research collections in the UK: The Anderson Report updated, Library Review, 47, 5-6, pp. 262-266, (1998); Choudhury S.G., Lorie M., Fitzpatrick E., Hobbs B., Chirikjian G., Okamura A., Flores N.E., Comprehensive access to printed materials (CAPM), Proceedings of the 1st ACM/IEEE-CS Joint Conference on Digital Libraries, Roanoke, VA, pp. 174-175, (2001); McLuhan M., The Gutenberg Galaxy: The Making of Typographic Man, (1962); McLuhan M., Powers B.R., The Global Village: Transformations in World Life and Media in the Twenty-First Century, (1989); Naisbitt J., Megatrends: Ten New Directions Transforming Our Lives, (1984); Salomon F., Beyer C.P., Historia De Las Bibliotecas De La Universidad Autónoma De Chihuahua, (2002); Toffler A., Future Shock, (1971); Toffler A., The Third Wave, (1981); Behan J., O'Keeffe D.T., LUCAS: The library assistant robot, implementation and localisation, Proceedings of the International Conference on Computational Intelligence for Modelling, Control and Automation and International Conference on Intelligent Agents, Web Technologies and Internet Commerce, 1, pp. 1140-1146, (2005); Blum R., Wellisch H.H., Kallimachos: The Alexandrian Library and the Origins of Bibliography, (1991); Carr D., The Promise of Cultural Institutions, (2003); Epstein J., Transformations of the book, (2003); Booksellers Association Blog, (2007); Febvre L., Martin H-J., The Coming of the Book, (1976); Gaskell P., A New Introduction to Bibliography, (1972); Giordano T., Electronic Resources Management and Long-Term Preservation (Is the Library a Growing Organism?), (2007); Lau J., Information Literacy: International Perspectives.

Reports the conduct of a national survey in Sweden to establish the desired research priorities for libraries. The research sought to establish what evidence-base is needed for evidence-based practice. Method. The Delphi method was employed to solicit opinions on the kinds of research needed by libraries of all kinds in Sweden. Research topics were obtained from practising librarians and identified in the professional literature and discussion lists. Two rounds of questionnaire survey using the sixty-four themes extracted were followed by an interactive workshop. Panel members were nominated by the practitioners themselves.Analysis. Standard statistical methods were employed to derive means and standard deviations and the Spearman rank correlation statistic was used to compare the results from different library sectors.Results. Consensus among panel members was not achieved during the survey rounds, but the workshop resulted in the identification of the ten highest priority themes. The public, regional and school libraries are more concerned with relation of libraries to education and society at large, while academic and special libraries emphasize the changes in scholarly and business communication and the impact of new technologies. Conclusions. The consensus among different Swedish library sectors regarding the top research agenda can be reached only conditionally. Strong differences between them remain and have to be taken into account when implementing the agenda. The panel members regard the library future as uncertain and prioritize the topics that can help to foster readers and library users and strengthen strategic positions of libraries. © the authors, 2009.","","","","","","","","","Baruchson-Arbib S., Bronstein J., A view to the future of the library and information science profession: A Delphi study, Journal of The American Society For Information Science and Technology, 53, 5, pp. 397-408, (2002); Blick A.R., Information science research versus the practitioner, Representation and Exchange of Knowledge As a Basis For Information Processes.

Many academic library users give preferences to Google, Google Scholar and other search engines on the internet when they search for information. As reference transactions are decreasing in many academic institutions, this paper aims to investigate the continuing need for mediated reference services in the technology-driven environment in academic libraries. Design/methodology/approach: The authors have conducted a literature review to document and analyze the current trends in reference services in academic libraries. They have examined the relevant published literature through a series of reflective questions to determine whether the demise of mediated reference services is imminent in academic libraries. While this literature review is by no means an exhaustive one, the authors have provided a fairly comprehensive representation of articles to synthesize an overview of the history, evolution, and current trends of reference services in academic libraries. Findings: This paper clearly demonstrates the importance of human-mediated reference services in academic libraries. It reinforces the need for skilled, knowledgeable professional librarians to provide effective and efficient reference services in a digital environment. Practical implications: This paper provides a comprehensive overview of current trends in reference services in academic libraries and analyzes the merits and demerits of these trends to establish the need for mediated reference services in academic libraries. The arguments used in this paper will be useful for library and informational professionals as validation for the need to hire skilled, knowledgeable reference librarians to provide reference services in a digital environment. Originality/value: This paper critically looks at the current trends and practices in reference services through the published literature to determine the future need for mediated reference services in academic libraries. It offers important insights to demonstrate why professional librarians’ skills, knowledge and expertise are essential to provide efficient reference services in the digital age. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Academic libraries; Embedded librarianship; Information literacy; Reference services; Research consultation service; Virtual reference service","","","","","","","","Aagard M.C., Antunez M.Y., Sand J.N., Mitchell E., Learning from degree-seeking older adult students in a university library, Reference Services Review, 43, 2, pp. 215-230, (2015); Adebonojo L.G., LibGuides: customizing subject guides for individual courses, College & Undergraduate Libraries, 17, 4, pp. 398-412, (2010); Antonelli P.A., BGSU-Firelands College, Library Reference Services and Information Literacy: Models for Academic Institutions, pp. 57-65, (2013); Applegate R., Whose decline?

Science librarian positions often draw smaller pools of applicants than social science or humanities positions, making it even more important that good hires are retained. We examine programs that contribute to recruitment and retention as well as some of the trends in science librarianship and the impact on science librarians. The differences in the needs and practices of new librarians versus mid-career science and technology librarians are also discussed. Solutions to the shortage of science librarians need to include creative recruitment, support for research and professional development, and promotion of involvement in national organizations. © 2006 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

Numerous scholars and experts in librarianship have advocated the importance of creating a learning library for handling various challenges, such as the rapid development of the Internet and digital technology. However, an effective learning organization relies on a positive learning culture and starts with an individual's commitment to learn. This study investigated the learning methods that are commonly adopted by staff in Taiwan's university and college libraries, measuring their values regarding the organizational learning culture and knowledge performance, and exploring the relationships among individual learning methods, organizational learning culture, and knowledge performance in these libraries. Based on the Dimensions of the Learning Organization Questionnaire (DLOQ) and previous studies, this study designed and conducted a questionnaire survey of 478 library employees in 162 universities and colleges across Taiwan. Some key findings of this study included: (1) the individual learning method of ""self-learning by using Internet resources"" is adopted most frequently by library staff in Taiwan's universities and colleges; (2) the overall values of staff members regarding their organizational learning cultures are not strong; (3) the two dimensions ""creating continuous learning opportunities"" and ""creating systems to capture and share learning"" can influence the methods of library staffs' learning formally and informally, and they can positively contribute to enhance the knowledge performance of the library. In addition, informal learning methods are likely to enhance organizational knowledge performance. © 2015 by De Gruyter.","academic libraries; learning culture; learning method; organizational learning; organizational performance; Taiwan","","","","","","","","Ames M., Heide D., The keys to successful management development in the 1990s, Management Decision, 30, 6, pp. 126-132, (1992); Auster E., Chan D.C., The library as a learning organization and the climate for updating in a period of rapidly changing technologies, Proceedings of ASIST2003, 40, 1, pp. 158-163, (2003); Burns R., The Adult Learner at Work, (1995); Chen K.N., Library evaluation and organizational learning: A questionnaire study, Journal of Librarianship and Information Science, 38, 2, pp. 93-104, (2006); Conner M.L., Informal learning: Developing a value for discovery, Leading Organizational Learning: Harnessing the Power of Knowledge, pp. 91-102, (2004); Dibella A.J., Nevis E.C., How Organizations Learn: An Integrated Strategy for Building Learning Capacity, (1998); Dodgson M., Organizational learning: A review of some literature, Organizational Studies, 14, 3, pp. 375-394, (1993); Giesecke J., McNeil B., Core competencies and the learning organization, Library Administration and Management, 13, 3, pp. 158-166, (1999); Gill S.J., Developing A Learning Culture in Nonprofit Organizations, (2009); Haley Q.K., The Relationship between Learning Organization Dimensions and Library Performance, (2010); Imran M., Rizvi S.H.M., Ali B., Impact of organizational learning on organizational performance, International Journal of Academic Research, 3, 4, pp. 424-427, (2011); Jones G.R., Organizational Theory: Text and Cases, (1997); Kumar N., Idris K., An examination of educational institutions' knowledge performance: Analysis, implications and outlines for future research, The Learning Organization, 13, 1, pp. 96-116, (2006); Langer A.M., IT and Organizational Learning: Managing Change Through Education and Technology, (2005); Lien Y.H., Dimensions of the learning organization and organization performance, Commerce and Management Quarterly, 3, 4, pp. 227-258, (2002); Marsick V.J., Watkins K.E., Demonstrating the value of an organization's learning culture: The dimensions of the learning organization questionnaire, Advances in Developing Human Resources, 5, 2, pp. 132-151, (2003); McHargue S.K., Learning for performance in nonprofit organizations, Advances in Developing Human Resources, 5, 2, pp. 197-204, (2003); Nunnally J.C., Psychometric Theory, (1978); Preskill H., Evaluation's role in enhancing organizational learning: A model for practice, Evaluation and Program Planning, 17, 3, pp. 291-297, (1994); Rowley J., The library as a learning organization, Library Management, 18, 2, pp. 88-91, (1997); Senge P.M., The Fifth Discipline: The Art and Practice of the Learning Organization, (1990); Somerville M., McConnell-Imbriotis A., Applying the learning organization concept in a resource squeezed service organization, Journal of Workplace Learning, 16, 4, pp. 237-248, (2004); Su S.S., An overview of individual learning and organizational learning in the academic library, Bulletin of Library and Information Science, 57, pp. 35-47, (2006); Torres R.T., Preskill H., Evaluation and organizational learning: Past, present, and future, American Journal of Evaluation, 22, 3, pp. 387-395, (2001); Watkins K.E., Marsick V.J., Building the learning organization: A new role for human resource developers, Studies in Continuing Education, 14, 2, pp. 115-129, (1992); Watkins K.E., Marsick V.J., Sculpting the Learning Organization: Lessons in the Art and Science of Systematic Change, (1993); Watkins K.E., Marsick V.J., Action: Creating the Learning Organization, (1996)","","","Walter de Gruyter GmbH","","","","","","00242667","","","","English","Libri","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84925685469"

It is focused on the priorities in the work of library associations in response to mobilizing science knowledge and policy for sustainable development. The report tracks the development and operation of the Bulgarian library associations - Bulgarian Library and Information Association (BLIA), Association of University Libraries (AUL) - and other library consortia - Bulgarian Information Consortium (BIC) and National Academic Library and Information System (NALIS). The main goal is to systematize the achievements in the implementation of projects and initiatives of the Bulgarian library associations in an effort to be effective partners of LIS higher education (especially with the State University of Library Studies and Information Technology), in lifelong learning of LIS professionals. Research methods: retrospective and systematic analysis, desk research and critical analysis of the results. The article's conclusions are linked with the national cultural policy, library legislation and with the collaboration between library associations and LIS education system. The research investigates the impact of the library organizations' activities on the theoretical fields of library and information science and education and also on library practice. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","Information Technology; Library association; lifelong learning; LIS higher education; State University of Library Studies","Education; Information management; Information technology; Research; Academic libraries; Critical analysis; Cultural construction; Education systems; Higher education; Knowledge society; Library and information science; Life long learning; State University of Library Studies; Systematic analysis; University libraries; Libraries","","","","","","","Yankova I., Association of the University Libraries in Bulgaria: New Approaches for Professional Dialogue, Proceedings of the Information/Documentation Management and Cooperation among the Libraries in the Balkan Countries Symposium, pp. 339-342, (2008); Stoykova D., Todorova T., Lifelong Learning Program for Librarian Organizers, Proceedings of the Informatics in the Scientific Knowledge Conference, pp. 418-430, (2010)","I.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper takes the form of a literature review and commentary on developments in the area of academic librarianship in a new information environment. Findings: The profession is finding ways to become equipped and incorporate new technologies into the existing framework of high-quality information service delivery. As the demands and wishes of end users transform, librarians have sought to re-define what the library building and services mean to those who use the library. Because the nature of the content librarians work with is dramatically re-structuring, so the profession is experimenting with new ideas for its capture, organization and delivery. Practical implications: It is important for academic librarians to work towards the transformation of their relationship with faculty to emphasize an ability to assist them with integrating information technology and library resources into courses. This is based on collaboration and networking. Originality/value: The paper reveals that change is happening in a new, increasingly competitive information environment in which the academic library is no longer necessarily the conventional resource of first choice for the academe it exists to serve. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Academic librarianship; Academic libraries; Constructivist approach; Information; Information literacy; Scaffolding","","","","","","","","Aharony N., Web 2.0 use by librarians, Library & Information Science Research, 31, 1, pp. 29-37, (2009); Allen M., Promoting critical thinking skills in online information literacy instruction using a constructivist approach, College & Undergraduate Libraries, 15, 1-2, pp. 21-38, (2008); A Statement of Policy Adopted by the Council of the American Library Association, (2002); Armstrong J., Designing a writing intensive course with information literacy and critical thinking learning outcomes, Reference Services Review, 38, 3, pp. 445-447, (2010); Asher C., Separate but equal: Librarians, academics and information literacy, Australian Academic & Research Libraries, 34, 1, pp. 52-55, (2003); Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education, (2000); Bain K., What the Best College Teachers Do, (2004); Bell S.J., Shank J., The blended librarian: A blueprint for redefining the teaching and learning role of academic librarians, College & Research Libraries News, 65, 7, pp. 372-375, (2004); Benton T.H., A laboratory of collaborative learning, Chronicle of Higher Education, 55, 43, pp. 31-33, (2009); Branin J.J., Knowledge management in academic libraries: Building the knowledge bank at the Ohio State University, Journal of Library Administration, 39, 4, pp. 41-56, (2003); Dakshinamurti G., Horne L., Integrating information literacy in a first-year university course: a case study from Canada, (2006); Fialkoff F., ProQuest acquires ebrary, Library Journal, 136, 3, pp. 20-21, (2011); Halttunen K., Scaffolding performance in IR instruction: Exploring learning experiences and performance in two learning environments, Journal of Information Science, 29, 5, pp. 375-390, (2003); Hane P.J., Newsbreaks, Information Today, 28, 2, (2011); Ivey R., Information literacy: how do librarians and academics work in partnership to deliver effective learning programs?, (2003); Macauley P., (2004); Parirokh M., Daneshgar F., Fattahi R., Identifying knowledge-sharing requirements in academic libraries, Library Review, 57, 2, pp. 107-122, (2008); Stahr M.A., (2008); Stowe B., I can't find anything: Towards establishing a continuum in curriculum-integrated library instruction, Reference Services Review, 39, 1, pp. 81-97, (2011); Vygotsky L.S., Mind in Society: The Development of Higher Psychological Processes, (1978); Albanese A., Google shakes up the e-book market, Publishers Weekly, 257, 49, pp. 4-5, (2010); Jackson C.M., (2007); McWilliam E., Taylor P.G., Thomson P., Green B., Maxwell T., Widy T., Simons D., (2002); Macauley P., Green R., Can our relationships be reconceptualized?

Insights, challenges, successes, projects as well as recommendations will be shared. Commonalities across libraries 3D printing technologies and maker space learning areas will also explored. Design/methodology/approach – This paper delves into six case studies of librarians that have implemented 3D printers and/or maker spaces in their libraries. The case studies focus on libraries at three different levels: school, public, and higher education with two case studies from each type. The author of this paper will describe the cases, projects, challenges, successes, along with other aspects of 3D printer, and maker space integration. Findings – 3D printing and maker spaces, while very popular in the field of librarianship can be incredibly exciting to implement but they come with challenges and successes just like any type of new technology. Librarians have to be fearless in implementing this technology, willing to learn on their feet, and be excited to explore. Originality/value – At this time most publications on 3D printing are held in the realm of popular publications (blogs, magazines, zines, etc.). Very little has been written on a wider range of case studies where 3D printers and maker spaces have been integrated into libraries of various types. This paper sets the foundation for further exploration in how 3D printing and maker spaces could be a part of library services. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","3D printing; 3D technology; Academic libraries; Maker spaces; Public libraries; School libraries","","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, (30850004)","","Bagley C.A., Makerspaces: Top Trailblazing Projects, (2014); Britton L., The makings of maker spaces, part 1: Space for creation, not just consumption, Library Journal, (2012); Britton L., Considine S., The makings of makerspaces, part 3: A fabulous home for cocreation, Library Journal, (2012); De Monchaux T., Learning from legos, pp. SR5-SR7, (2014); Fisher E., Makerspaces move into academic libraries, (2012); Groenendyk M., Gallant R., 3D printing and scanning at the dalhousie university libraries: A pilot project, Library Hi Tech, 31, 1, pp. 31-41, (2013); Jamaluddin A., 10 things you need to know before buying a 3D printer, (2013); Kaur S., How is 'internet of the 3D printed products' going to affect our lives, IETE Technical Review, 29, 5, pp. 360-364, (2012); Koerber J., The makings of makerspaces, part 2: Express yourself, Library Journal, (2012); Massis B.E., 3D printing and the library, New Library World, 114, 7-8, pp. 351-354, (2013); Peppler K., Bender S., Maker movement spreads innovation one project at a time, Phi Kappa Deltan, 95, 3, (2013); Preddy L.B., School Library Makerspaces: Grades 6-12, (2013); Turner A., Welch B., Reynolds S., Learning spaces in academic libraries-a review of the evolving trends, Australian Academic and Research Libraries, 44, 4, pp. 226-234, (2013); Brooks M., Heller M., Library labs, Reference & User Services Quarterly, 52, 3, pp. 186-189, (2013); Kurt L., Colgrove T., 3D printers in the library: Toward a fablab in the academic library, ACRL TechConnect, (2012)","H.M.

In an information market where technology has increased access to content, thereby providing resources at one’s fingertips, the provision of services is increasingly becoming a distinctive signifier of excellence and quality. In such an open/service-oriented marketplace, what are the services that are signifiers of excellence and consequently distinguish a library? This paper aims to review select literature within the USA to identify the services that are signifiers of excellence and that will consequently distinguish a library in the current era and investigate the extent to which said services identified in the review of the literature are provided by the University of the West Indies (UWI) Mona library, but focus specifically on only those that meet the additional criteria of placing the UWI Mona library as either the first to introduce the service in Jamaica or as the only library in Jamaica with the particular service offering. These two additional criteria provide the added signature or uniqueness essential to being distinguished. Design/methodology/approach: Through the use of a mixed methods research, this paper highlights library service offerings considered as distinctive signifiers of excellence within the American literature and also within the UWI Mona Library – that will distinguish a library. Findings: This paper reveals services incorporating technology, the library as a place/space, teaching and research and personal attention to users as distinctive signifiers of excellence. In this regard, within the UWI Mona Library, services offered such as the Virtual Reference Service, Extended Opening Service, Halls of Residence Librarian Service, Information Commons Service, Information Literacy Service and the West Indies and Special Collection Research Service were found to incorporate the aforementioned service themes and placed the UWI Mona library as either the first to introduce the service in Jamaica or as the only library in Jamaica with the particular service offering, consequently distinguishing the UWI Mona Library from other academic libraries in Jamaica. Originality/value: This paper is of value, as it provides the library and information community with an outline of services that distinguish a library; it offers library managers in Jamaica and the rest of the world the opportunity to compare services in their libraries with that of other libraries as outlined within the literature review as well as within the UWI Mona library; it highlights how the UWI Mona library, an academic library in the Caribbean, compares on the international library scene, with particular reference to the USA; it informs current and potential library users of how the UWI Mona library is trending in service culture and a focus on distinctive services can promote a community of academic library service best practice. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Academic library services; Caribbean libraries; Jamaican academic libraries; Library services; New library services; University libraries","","","","","","","","2010 top trends in academic libraries: a review of the current literature, College & Research Library News, 71, 6, pp. 286-292, (2010); 2012 top ten trends in academic libraries: a review of the trends and issues affecting academic libraries in higher education, College & Research Library News, 73, 6, pp. 311-320, (2012); Top trends in academic libraries: a review of the trends and issues affecting academic libraries in higher education, College & Research Libraries News, 75, 6, pp. 294-302, (2014); 2016 top trends in academic libraries: a review of the trends and issues affecting academic libraries in higher education, College & Research Library News, 77, 6, pp. 274-281, (2016); Adams J.L., Gunn K.B., Keeping up with … Digital Humanities, (2013); Bell S., Evolution in higher education matters to libraries, New Roles for the Road Ahead: Essays Commissioned for Acrl’S 75th Anniversary, pp. 13-18, (2015); Bowen G.A., Document analysis as a qualitative research method, Qualitative Research Journal, 9, 2, pp. 27-40, (2009); Covert-Vail L., Collard S., New Role for New Times: Research Library Services for Graduate Students, (2012); Cronenwett P.N., Osborn K., Streit S.A., Celebrating Research: Rare and Special Collections from the Membership of the Association of Research Libraries, (2007); Cummings L.U., Bursting out of the box: outreach to the millenial generation through student services programs, Reference Services Review, 35, 2, pp. 285-295, (2007); Del Bosque D., Chapman K., Your place or mine?

Online instructors have moved from ""sage on a stage,"" attempting to duplicate regular, face-to-face instruction to ""meddler in the middle,"" facilitating interactive, technology-driven learning experiences. Librarians are the consummate ""meddlers,"" partnering with instructors to provide meaningful information literacy learning in the distributed learning environment. This chapter examines strategies used and lessons learned by a library at a mid-sized institution that has transformed from a traditional brick and mortar university to an active online academic community. The chapter discusses the application of online learning tools in the creation of an authentic learning experience for students in a distributed environment. Authors offer practical, in-the-trenches advice and reflections on their experiences and how they informed the development of best practices for providing library services in an online environment at Eastern Kentucky University Libraries. By offering their experiences, the authors hope to provide a framework for others working in distributed learning environments. © 2017 T. Maddison and M.

This paper presents the embedded patent information service at Nanjing Technology University (NJTech) Library (Nanjing, China) and focuses on how it was designed and developed. Citation analysis and questionnaire survey were applied to study NJTech researchers' information behavior on patents so that the librarians could identify their unmet information needs. Based on the analysis of data collected from the citation analysis and questionnaire, the librarians found that they could assist researchers through collaboration and partnership in searching related patents, analyzing technology trends, identifying valuable patents, and tracking new emerging related patents. In the process of embedded service on patents, the role of the academic librarian at NJTech University has been extended to ""Patent Specialist,"" requiring close collaboration with researchers, embedding in their research units and groups, and helping them to make full use of patent information resources and become more effectively innovative in research. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Competences of a librarian; Embedded librarianship; Patent information service","","","","","","Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE, (13YJA870021)","This work was supported by MOE ( Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China ) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences (Project No. 13YJA870021 ).

That exploration becomes even more critical in view of the exponential growth of available legal information in primary, secondary and web sources and the attendant change in legal information processing and management. The topic was discussed in a Nigerian Institute of Advanced Legal Studies' (NIALS) workshop in June 2007. Design/methodology/approach: An exploratory research design was adopted. The method was to first examine the course objectives of the workshop to ensure that it is well packaged to empower and re-equip law librarians and information professionals. The next approach was to discuss the NIALS as the apex Institute for research and advanced studies in law. Then, the general overview of the workshop was discussed. Findings: Law libraries and law librarians are challenged to develop better retrieval tools that enable access to legal and other subject-specific information needed by the library's critical public and clientele system - user community. This is being necessitated by the fact that computer and other electronic systems are now used in the provision of technical services such as the production of catalog cards, indexing and abstracting of legal materials, to mention but a few. Originality/value: The paper's originality lies in its discussion that new law librarians and other information professionals often find it difficult to relate their academic library training to real-life professionals practice situation, especially in the sophisticated discipline of law. Older professionals on the other hand need retraining to adapt to the new era of technology-driven information handling methodologies. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Academic libraries; Law; Nigeria; Special librarianship","","","","","","","","National workshop on technical services in law libraries, Proceedings of a Workshop Held at Nigerian Institute of Advanced Legal Studies, (2007); Information brochure, NIALS, (1991)","U.

Design/methodology/approach: The study framework was based on technology acceptance model (TAM). A sample of Pakistani university students completed the questionnaire measuring the effects of extraneous stimuli through cognitive responses on adoption of the HEC digital library. To test the research hypotheses, multiple regression analysis was used. Findings: The findings revealed that: cognitive responses predicted students’ intention of using HEC digital library; extraneous variables significantly influenced cognitive responses; system characteristics directly influenced usefulness and ease of use; interface characteristics directly influenced cognitive responses; and individual differences significantly affected the ease of use. Similarly, system quality was identified with the highest direct effect on usefulness, whereas navigation had the highest influence on easy use of the HEC digital library of Pakistan. In addition, usefulness was explored with the highest effect on intention to use the HEC digital library of Pakistan. The findings revealed that individual behaviours influence the use of digital libraries which imply that acceptance of an information system (IS) involve cognitive idiosyncrasies. Findings of the study are useful for Pakistani academic librarians to enhance adoption and usability of the HEC digital library of Pakistan. The study extended cross-cultural validation of TAM and explored how that Pakistani university students utilize HEC digital library. Research limitations/implications: These findings have significant implications for librarians in developing countries, such as to evaluate usability of digital libraries from individuals’ perspective, create awareness, customize users’ interface and train students in navigational techniques. It may also facilitate librarians to improve their current levels of library assistance and emphasize the usefulness of digital libraries towards academic excellence. The findings equally suggest that individual behaviours influence the use of digital libraries because acceptance of an information system involves cognitive idiosyncrasies. This study explored all possible links between the study constructs and emphasized that findings are useful to enhance the adoption and usability of digital library in the developing countries. Originality/value: This study is the first attempt that empirically assessed the adoption of digital libraries in terms of Pakistani research students. The study validated TAM in the context of Pakistani university librarianship that extended the cross-cultural validation of TAM. Furthermore, the study focused on real constructs instead of dummy variables and predicted significant effects on acceptance and rejection of digital libraries. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Adoption of technology;

Design/methodology/approach - Library and Information Science Abstracts (LISA) was used to retrieve data of journal articles in digital libraries from 1960 to 2002. By employing the thesaurus search function, three descriptors for subject search, namely electronic library concept, digital libraries and virtual library concept, as suggested by LISA, were used to retrieve all relevant literature on digital libraries. Findings - Most of the citing core journals on digital libraries are devoted to the subject of the application of computer and information technology to library implication, while the cited literature on digital libraries distributes mainly into four types of journals, namely, digital library orientation, general library and information science, new development in librarianship, and library technology. Digital libraries, electronic media and world wide web (WWW) are the three subject terms in common most for both citing and cited core journal literature. They also constitute the core subject for digital library literature. The change of highly used subject terms, such as WWW, internet, library technology, network, university or academic library, from cited to citing literature suggests that these subjects are becoming the main stream of researches in digital libraries. Research limitations/implications - Most subject terms of this study for both citing and cited literature in digital libraries could be categorized into the technical issues. However, other related issues dealing with copyright, charging and authenticity; social issues; quality of preservation and availability; use and user study; economic issues; education and promotion have not been popular research areas yet by 2002. Further studies are needed. Originality/value - The present work is unique in its study of the subject and the results obtained provide significant insights into the evolution of digital libraries by identifying the core journals and examining their characteristics, as well as subject changes between citing and cited literature on digital libraries.","Digital libraries; Information searches; Serials","","","","","","","","Borgman C.L., From acting locally to thinking globally: A brief history of library automation, The Library Quarterly, 67, 3, pp. 215-249, (1997); Borgman C.L., What are digital libraries?

Design/methodology/approach- A survey was conducted through a well structured and precise questionnaire and circulated personally among 180 students studying at Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi. Findings- The study reveals the fact that majority of the students' use informal learning spaces for academic purpose and feels that library plays an important role in making them to use of informal learning spaces for academic purpose. Research limitations/implications- The geographical area of study was confined to the students of the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi purely regarding the use and their opinion of Informal Learning Space. The research results are limited to this environment only. Originality/value- In India, limited studies have been conducted on informal learning space but as it is an emerging concept in librarianship, it is imperative to know the users' behavior and attitude towards it. The study highlights the students' opinion of Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi regarding use of Informal Learning Spaces and its role in academic environment. The study also opens the path for some more studies to be conducted on this area.","Academic libraries; Informal learning; Informal learning space; Informal space; Learning environment","","","","","","Indian Institute of Technology","I am thankful to Dr. Narender Kumar, Librarian, Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi and all the respondents for their kind cooperation and support extended during the study.","Berth M.; Bodnar J., Information and Learning Commons, Faculty and Student Benefits, New Library World, 110, pp. 403-409, (2009); Brooks D.C., Space Matters: the impact of formal learning environments on student learning, British Journal of Educational Technology, pp. 1-8, (2010); Brown Malcolm B., Joan L.K., Learning spaces: more than meets the eye, EDUCAUSE QUARTERLY, 26, 1, pp. 14-16, (2003); Bryant J., Matthews G., Walton G., Academic Libraries and Social Learning Space: A Case Study of Loughborough University Library, UK, Journal of Librarianship and Information Science, 41, 1, pp. 7-18, (2009); Conlon T., A review of informal learning literature, theory and implications for practice in developing global professional competence, Journal of European Industrial Training, 28, 2-4, pp. 283-295, (2003); Eraut M., Non-formal Learning and Tacit Knowledge in Professional Work, British Journal of Educational Psychology, 70, pp. 113-136, (2000); Hall R., Towards a Fusion of Formal and Informal Learning Environemnts: the impact of the Read/Write Web, Electronic Journal of e-learning, 7, 1, pp. 29-40, (2009); Harrop D., Turpin B., A study exploring learners' informal learning space behavior, attitudes, and preferences, New Review of Academic Librarianship, 19, pp. 58-77, (2013); Hunter J., Cox A., Learning over tea!

Yet we are also products of colonial legacies which have engendered Western domination to the detriment of Africans. Can librarians from the West contribute to sustainable democratic futures by supporting the catalytic role of librarians in Africa who strive to support African-centered scholarship and struggles against legacies of colonialism? Or will we re-inscribe colonial legacies through our partnerships and promotion of Western centered models? Based upon the author’s tour of selected higher education settings and academic libraries in Kenya and South Africa in 2001, the author reflects upon libraries in the context of “development” in Africa. The author begins to discern potentially viable models and develop criteria for partnerships by comparing methods of advocacy, collaboration and projects for information and digital futures. Descriptions of efforts to “build capacity” within African librarianship include those of African librarians and their associations, The Association of African Universities (AAU), The Africana Librarians Council (ALC), The World Bank, and The International Network for the Availability of Scientific Publications (INASP). The author observed the marketing of technology in Africa and characterizes some of the privileged dialogue on Information Communication Technologies (ICT) as the exportation of “technolust” which the author argues, contributes to increased privatization and the sacrifice of support to public universities. Such privatization reduces the broad social role of librarians and further marginalizes reference services. The author identifies critical literacies and sharing of cross-continental experience as essential in creating “mutually beneficial partnerships” to support cooperative, sustainable, democratic, information futures. In an effort to continue this important conversation and develop “true partnerships,” the author shares her experience and reflection. Calls for dialogue throughout the African diaspora and beyond to promote community-based, democratic education and a sustainable intellectual, reading culture in Africa are recommended. © 2004 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

Design/methodology/approach: The content is based on the literature, personal communication with national and foreign peers, the writer's 25 years' experience, observation and research in the field of librarianship. Findings: Libraries in developing countries are being significantly affected by the ongoing ICT developments from basic infrastructure to collections to services to needed human resources. All quarters of the community need vision and preparedness to turn challenges into opportunities, and instead of being chaotic make change that is productive for society and themselves. It appeared that the overall growth in librarianship is much better since the dawn of the twenty-first century. Originality/value: The new aspects discussed in the context of Pakistan may provide guidelines for future planning, and growth of professional and libraries. It is assumed that the situation is similar to other developing countries.

The author considers each core competency in the context of the most important factors responsible for continuing changes in the training and retraining of reference professionals.

The paper presents an interview that took place at the American Library Association Annual Meeting in Anaheim, California. The paper reveals that many of the developments are slow. There are very few really sudden revolutions in social-scale technologies. They do not switch on quickly and cannot be sudden because the installed base is too thin. The paper reveals that there should be some renewed conversation about how libraries can help the public. In the early days of the internet libraries played an enormous uncredited role in teaching the adult population about the internet. There are some opportunities like that now, and one place where we are starting to see signs of it is digital preservation, not as libraries doing it for the cultural record, but helping individuals to do it for their own content. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Academic libraries; Information technology; Librarianship history","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","07378831","","","","English","Libr.

Are senior academic library managers reacting rightly and proactively making the correct strategic decisions now to ensure the rightful and proper place for librarians in a university for decades to come? Second, assuming there will indeed be university libraries and ""librarians"" to people them in the future, what professional and personal attributes will future librarians need, not only to ride the e-revolution wave, but also to prosper as leaders in their institutions to the year 2057 and beyond? Design/methodology/approach - A general review of the current state-of-play in academic library management vis-à-vis the e-revolution, in terms of the history of the profession and previous perceived ""revolutions"". Findings - Suggests academic library professionals are over-reacting to the ""newness"" of the electronic environment and under-valuing their own professional traditions and their own people. Practical implications - Proposes remedies: advising caution, common sense, and the right sort of professionals to ""brand"" the library for a successful future.

Methods: Each member of the project group approached between one and five individuals known to them to generate a convenience sample of 22 employers of health librarians. There were 15 semi-structured interviews conducted between October and November 2010 with employers in the hospital, academic, government, private, consumer health and not-for-profit sectors. The interview schedule was sent to each interviewee prior to the interview so that they had time to consider their responses. The researchers wrote up the interview notes using the interview schedule and submitted them to the principal researcher, who combined the data into one document. Content analysis of the data was used to identify major themes. Results: Employers expressed a clear sense of respect for the roles and responsibilities of library staff in their organizations. Areas of practice such as education and training, scientific research and clinical support were highlighted as critical for the future. Current areas of practice such as using technology and systems to manage information, providing information services to meet user needs and management of health information resources in a range of formats were identified as remaining highly relevant for the future. There was potential for health librarians to play a more active and strategic role in their organizations, and to repackage their traditional skill sets for anticipated future roles. Interpersonal skills and the role of health librarians as the interface between clinicians and information technology were also identified as critical for the future. Conclusions: Interviews with employers provided valuable insights into the current and future roles and skills requirements of health librarians in Australia, enriching the findings of the earlier stages of the research project. The next step is to work with the stakeholder groups in this project and use the research project's findings as the evidence base on which to develop a structured, modular education framework comprising a postgraduate qualification in health librarianship and a continuing professional development structure supporting a three-year cycle of certification and revalidation. © 2011 Lewis, Hallam, Ritchie, Clark, Hamill, Foti and O'Connor.","","","","","","","","","Abels E.G., Cogdill K.W., Zach L., The contributions of library and information services to hospitals and academic health sciences centers: a preliminary taxonomy, Journal of the Medical Library Association, 90, 3, pp. 276-284, (2002); Cohen L., Manion L., Morrison K., Research methods in education, (2007); Dunn K., Brewer K., Marshall J.G., Sollenberger J., Measuring the value and impact of health sciences libraries: planning an update and replication of the Rochester Study, Journal of the Medical Library Association, 97, 4, pp. 308-312, (2009); Hallam G., Ritchie A., Hamill C., Lewis S., Newton-Smith C., Kammermann M., O'Connor P., Australia's health libraries: a research-directed future, Library Trends, 59, 1, pp. 350-372, (2010); Holst R., Funk C.J., Adams H.S., Bandy M., Boss C.M., Hill B., Joseph C.B., Lett R.K., Vital pathways for hospital librarians: present and future roles, Journal of the Medical Library Association, 97, 4, pp. 285-292, (2009); Krippendorff K., Content analysis: an introduction to its methodology, (2004); Leedy P.D., Ormrod J.E., Practical research: Planning and design, (2001); Lyons R., Commentary.

Methods: Thirty organisations participated in an online survey on the perceived purposes, benefits and difficulties in using Web 2.0. A phone interview was further conducted with eight organisations (26.7%) to collect information on the use of Web 2.0. Data were analysed using both quantitative and qualitative approaches. Results: Results showed that knowledge and information sharing and the provision of a better communication platform were rated as the main purposes of using Web 2.0. Time constraints and low staff engagement were the most highly rated difficulties. In addition, most participants found Web 2.0 to be beneficial to their organisations. Conclusions: Medical-related organisations that adopted Web 2.0 technologies have found them useful, with benefits outweighing the difficulties in the long run.

This paper seeks to address this issue. Design/methodology/approach: This Dutch case study describes an innovative academic professional learning programme and its development through a process of intensive stakeholder consultation and co-creation. Findings: Market analysis and stakeholder consultation revealed that traditional professional development programs are not sufficient, and that an innovative learning approach is needed to accommodate professionals in the current disruptive context. Through intensive co-creation between academics and library stakeholders, a learning approach was developed that combines workplace learning, networked learning and distance learning with intensive inspirational face-to-face sessions, merging formal and informal learning. A first batch of professionals has just started the programme that centres around four main themes that deal with the current challenges for public libraries: changes in society, culture, organisation and technology. Each theme is integrated into the main learning stream of collectively developing new librarianship. Practical implications: The Library School learning approach is expected to be suitable for many sectors that deal with continuous professional development. Social implications: Society in the twenty-first century requires innovative approaches to continuous professional development. Close collaboration between universities and professional stakeholders can lead to sector-wide commitment and thus create added value for all parties involved and for society as a whole. Originality/value: A co-creative development process has led to an innovative learning approach for continuous professional development.

Professionals working in a range of fields, including librarianship, computer science and health information technology, journalism, and health communication can be involved in providing consumer health information, or health information targeting laypeople. This volume clearly examines the properties of health information that make it particularly challenging information to provide in diverse settings. • Addresses professional challenges and ethical problems of communicating health information to lay people in non-clinical settings • Focuses on health information as a challenge for different professionals providing health information in different settings • Emphasizes the shared challenges of information practice across different settings as well as those facing professionals in different roles. © C.

It reviews the historical background of academic freedom and librarianship in Canada, academic freedom language in collective agreements, rights legislation in Canada versus the United States as it pertains to academic librarianship, and rights statements supported by Canadian associations in the library field and associations representing members in postsecondary institutions. The implications of academic librarians using the new communication technologies and social media platforms, such as blogs and networking sites, with respect to academic freedom are examined, as well as, an overview of recent attacks on the academic freedom of academic librarians in the United States and Canada. Included in this analysis are the results of a survey of Canadian academic librarians, which examined attitudes about academic freedom, the external and internal factors which have an impact on academic freedom, and the professional use of new communication technologies and social media platforms. © 2015 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Academic freedom; Academic librarians; Canada; Defamation; Freedom of expression; Social media","","","","","","","","Aharony N., An exploratory analysis of librarians' blogs: Their development, nature and changes, Aslib Proceedings, 61, 6, pp. 587-604, (2009); Aharony N., Librarian and information scientists in the blogosphere, Library & Information Science Research, 31, 3, pp. 174-181, (2009); American Association of University Professors (AAUP), 1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure with 1970 Interpretive Comments, (1940); American Association of University Professors (AAUP), Joint Statement on Faculty Status of College and University Librarians, (2012); American Association of University Professors (AAUP), AAUP Statement on the Kansas Board of Regents Social Media Policy, (2013); American Association of University Professors (AAUP), Academic Freedom and Electronic Communications, (2013); American Library Association, Intellectual Freedom Principles for Academic Libraries, (2000); American Library Association, Academic Bill of Rights (ARBOR), (2014); American Library Association, Office for Intellectual Freedom, Intellectual Freedom Manual, (2014); Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL), Model statement of criteria and procedures for appointment, promotion in academic rank, and tenure for college and university librarians.

Information and the Professional Scientist and Engineer examines how electronic resources have affected the ways engineers and scientists seek, use, and communicate information vital to their research and development needs. Information specialists working in academic, corporate, government, and organization libraries discuss the changes in user behavior as academics in science and engineering fields rely more and more on the Internet and online journals. The book provides unique insight into the specific educational needs of college and university students as librarians and department faculty determine appropriate instruction for science and engineering classes. Information and the Professional Scientist and Engineer addresses the distinctions among various science and engineering fields, types of libraries, communities of users, and users within a field or discipline. Within these discussions, librarians also examine the differences between commercial and academic databases, and between personal or group subscriptions to database services, print, and online journals. The book also addresses Geographic Information Systems users through a study of the interconnection among disciplines associated with GIS. Information and the Professional Scientist and Engineer includes bibliographies that provide valuable information resources, reviews of pertinent web sites, tables, figures, and interviews while addressing: • the information-seeking behavior of chemists, geologists, pharmacists, botanists, and zoologists • the case for an engineering knowledge community • online bibliographic sources in hydrology • a practical guide to finding physical properties of chemicals • new reference works in science and technology • new age e-journals, indexes, and services Information and the Professional Scientist and Engineer is a unique resource for librarians and other information specialists, science and engineering faculty and students, and academic administrators. © 2001 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper employs document analysis and critical analysis. Findings: The paper finds that IL is, in part, the result of librarians' need to protect their professional territory from the systemic disturbances caused by information technology, fiscal challenges and the educational reform movement. Research limitations/implications: The paper should be of interest to researchers involved in the field of IL. Practical implications: The paper discusses the place of IL in the field of modern librarianship, and as such should be wide interest in various sectors of librarianship.

Wiberley, Julie M. Hurd, and Ann C. Weller 2006 (WHW 2006), which covers a wide assortment of journals, to compile instead the affiliations of college and university authors in articles published between 2000-2010 in the journals most favored by American science, engineering, medical, and agricultural librarians. These journals included Science and Technology Libraries, Issues in Science and Technology Librarianship, Journal of Agricultural and Food Information, Journal of the Medical Library Association, and Medical Reference Services Quarterly. Unlike many previous studies, it emphasizes the number of papers published, not the number of librarians it took to write them. The study demonstrates that the WHW 2006 top twenty did rather well in this more narrowly focused science-oriented journal assortment over this timespan. Furthermore, while a statistically significant number of schools that happened to have graduate programs in library and information science (LIS) on their campuses were notable for their output in these journals, LIS faculty publishing was not a significant factor in their attaining a high ranking in this study, as shown by the thirty-eight of the forty-five ranking schools providing faculty status for academic librarians.

Professional organizations assist health sciences librarians by offering opportunities for continuing education, communication, and advocacy. Most health sciences librarianswork in libraries that are located in academic health science centers, hospitals, corporations, associations and societies, the government, and other settings. These libraries are diverse in their mission and goals, collections, facilities, clients, and services offered.With the largest health sciences library collection in the world, the U.S. National Library of Medicine is central to health sciences library services, providing leadership and direction, and producing comprehensive services and products. Among the many trends and issues influencing health sciences librarianship, the impact of technology is probably the largest. Information technologies pervade every aspect of health sciences librarianship and provide new career opportunities for health sciences librarians. Librarians must be alert to changes in health care, education, information technologies, communications, and research, as these are likely to impact the future of health sciences librarianship. © 2008 by The Haworth Press, Taylor & Francis Group.

One of Parker's motivations to automate stemmed from a desire to professionalize academic librarianship, and this is evident in his administration as library director at the University of Missouri. Importantly, the motivation implies a simple means of judging the critical use of technology: that any substantive technology should be evaluated by how well it benefits librarians. Parker's additional contributions included consulting and coauthoring, with Frederick G.

Design/methodology/approach: Using a survey method, this study attempted to explore a strategic-based measure for improving academic law libraries in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Data were collected from 43 respondents through semi-structured interviews, including library and information science professionals, academicians and administrative officers of the affiliation awarding institutions and principals of the law colleges. Findings: Based on the interview findings, the study found that most of the law colleges do not pay attention towards the development of their institutional libraries. Outdated collections, scarcity of information and communication technologies and budgetary issues, inactive roles of regulating bodies and professional associations, limited roles of professional library staff, limited access to the Higher Education Commission digital library, absence of proper library setup and moral obligations and responsibilities of institutional administrations towards the development of academic law libraries were the main challenges. Research limitations/implications: The scope of this paper covers Constituent Law College of the University of Peshawar and its 18 affiliated law colleges (Total 19), and the geographical area is restricted to the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The scope of this paper can be extended to additional private and public sector universities in Pakistan, as well as abroad. Originality/value: This study is the first of its kind in Pakistan which will help the stockholders of affiliated and affiliation granting institutions to improve the current situation of academic law libraries in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The study presents a number of suggestions for the improvement of academic law libraries, which may be of value to the local institutions and developing countries with similar situations. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Academic law libraries; Affiliated law colleges; Khyber Pakhtunkhwa; Law librarianship; Pakistan; University of Peshawar","","","","","","","","Darkey E.M., Improving services in law libraries: the case of the faculty of law library, University of Ghana, Legon, International Journal of Legal Research, 38, 1, pp. 80-93, (2008); Khan A., Bhatti R., Role of law libraries in the promotion of legal education in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa: the case of University of Peshawar and its affiliated law colleges, Journal of Law and Society, 39, 54, pp. 155-174, (2009); Khan G., Information needs and seeking behaviour of the law faculty members: the survey of the University of Peshawar, (2010); Khan G., Bhatti R., Information needs and seeking behavior of the law faculty members: the survey of the University of Peshawar and its affiliated law colleges, Library Philosophy and Practice, 8, 1, pp. 1-12, (2012); Khan G., Bhatti R., Information needs and seeking behaviour of law students: the survey of Law College, University of Peshawar, Pakistan Journal of Library & Information Science, 43, 3, pp. 34-38, (2012); Khan G., Bhatti R., Determinants of academic law libraries’ use, collections, and services among the faculty members: a case study of University of Peshawar, Collection Building, 34, 4, pp. 119-127, (2015); Khan J.R., Justice Law College [Brochure], (1995); National Judicial Conference, (2007); Lenz C., Wohl H., Does form follow functions?

The research mainly consists of the selection, assessment and web-display of the most relevant abstracts on knowledge management, information representation, natural language processing, abstract/abstracting, modelling the scientific document, information retrieval and information evaluation. The resulting Cyberabstracts portal presents its products consistently and includes reference, abstract, keywords, assessment and access to the full document.

Design/methodology/approach: Over the course of a year, web-based polling was used in library instruction sessions and the survey results were recorded. Feedback forms were also used to gauge a sense of the students' experiences with this form of active learning. Findings: This study found that web-based polling in a library instruction classroom benefits both students and instructors. The students enjoy these sessions and are more attentive than in a typical lecture, which leads to better learning. Instructors are able to learn about the students' uses of technology, research methods, and more with the polling capability.

It could also be beneficial to test the functionality of paid accounts as well as seeing how other web sites compare. Practical implications: This article may assist those deciding between different audience response systems and provide tips to those wishing to implement web-based polling, and more specifically Poll Everywhere, in their sessions. Originality/value: Few articles on audience response systems exist solely on web-based polling and the benefits instructors can reap in addition to their students. This research will be of benefit to any librarian who teaches in the classroom, especially those in academic libraries. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Academic libraries; Librarianship; Library instruction; Survey methods; Surveys; Teaching aids; Technology","","","","","","","","Anderson J.Q., Rainie L., The future of the internet, (2010); Chan E.K., Knight L.A., Clicking with your audience: Evaluating the use of personal response systems in library instruction, Communications in Information Literacy, 4, 2, pp. 192-201, (2010); ComScore reports April 2011 US mobile subscriber market share, (2011); Harris A., Active learning for the Millennial Generation, Georgia Library Quarterly, 47, 4, pp. 13-14, (2010); Hoffman C., Goodwin S., A clicker for your thoughts: Technology for active learning, New Library World, 107, 1228-1229, pp. 422-433, (2006); Jacklin M.L., Working together: Librarian and student collaboration through active learning in a library eclassroom, Partnership: The Canadian Journal of Library and Information Practice and Research, 5, 1, pp. 1-27, (2010); Kay R.H., LeSage A., Examining the benefits and challenges of using audience response systems: A review of the literature, Computers & Education, 53, 3, pp. 819-827, (2009); Lancaster L.C., Stillman D., The M-Factor: How the Millennial Generation is Rocking the Workplace, (2010); Lenhart A., Ling R., Campbell S., Purcell K., Teens, cell phones and texting, (2010); Little G., Keeping moving: Smart phone and mobile technologies in the academic library, The Journal of Academic Librarianship, 37, 3, pp. 267-269, (2011); Lyman F., The responsive classroom discussion, Mainstreaming Digest: A Collection of Faculty and Student Papers, pp. 109-113, (1981); Mandernach B.J., Embracing texting during class, The Teaching Professor, 24, 10, pp. 1-6, (2010); Mintel, Mobile phones - US - February 2011: Reports, Mintel Oxygen database, (2011); Mutchler L.A., Shim J.P., Ormond D., Exploratory study on users' behavior: Smartphone usage, (2011); Polling, n., (2011); Roehling P.V., Vander Kooi T.L., Dykema S., Quisenberry B., Vandlen C., Engaging the Millennial Generation in class discussions, College Teaching, 59, 1, pp. 1-6, (2010); Sellar M., Poll Everywhere, The Charleston Advisor, 12, 3, pp. 57-60, (2011); Smith A., Americans and their cell phones, Pew Internet & American Life Project, (2011); Smith A., Smartphone adoption and usage, Pew Internet & American Life Project, (2011); Young J.R., Smartphones on campus: The search for 'killer' apps, The Chronicle of Higher Education: The Digital Campus, (2011)","J.

The written culture in Finland started in the 15th century AD. The Reformation meant the eventual outbreak of the Finnish culture, both from the point of view of the religious and academic cultures. The Academy of Turku was established in 1640. The public library network started to evolve from the 17th century onward. From the beginning of the independence, i.e. 1917, libraries have played an important part in the development of an open and democratic society. At present there are public libraries in all the municipalities as defined by the Public Library Act, in addition to the Finnish higher education and special libraries that constitute a modern library network open to all citizens that utilizes modern library technologies. © The Author(s) 2012.","cultural history; Finland; history; libraries; library network","","","","","","Opetus- ja Kulttuuriministeriö","The largest library association is the Finnish Library Association (FLA), which considers itself as an organization to promote the ideology of the library, a lobbyist for libraries and a developer of the library field.

By setting out the successive steps involved in the as yet unfinished process of building our mobile services portfolio, we aim to offer a detailed picture of the mobile services and features offered by a university library from a case study perspective. The main topics to be discussed include: • The BRGF's mobile website, including the information available, its interactive capabilities and the services it provides to its users. • The mobile-friendly version of UPCommons (the UPC Library Service's institutional repositories). • The UPC Library Service's mobile OPAC. • The mobile version of u-win (BRGF's videogame service). • The use of QR codes to deliver information to mobile devices. • Text message notifications. Additional topics for discussion include: • The library's organisation and the organisational concepts that underpin and make possible its technological developments (including mobile). • BRGF's concern regarding the reduction of investment in the development of mobile services. • The criteria and tools used to guide the library's decisions regarding the design and orientation of current and future mobile services. • How mobile services can help to improve the image of the library as a leading technology site. • Selected mobile features that BRGF plans to offer in the near future. Ultimately, this paper aims to delineate the effectiveness and potential of delivering library services by the preferred means of communication of a new generation of students and teachers.","Academic libraries; Handheld devices; Mobile communication systems; Mobile devices; Mobile libraries; Mobile services","","","","","","","","Games and Gaming, (2008); Arroyo-Vazquez N., Web móvil y bibliotecas, El Profesional De La Información, 18, 2, pp. 129-136, (2009); Castells M., Et al., Comunicación Móvil Y Sociedad: Una Perspectiva Global, (2007); Codina Vila M., Perez Galvez A., Clavero Campos J., Mobile services in the Rector Gabriel Ferraté Library, Technical University of Catalonia, Reference Services Review, 38, 2, pp. 321-334, (2010); Nota Mensual: Enero 2010, (2010); Davidson M., Make Your Site Mobile-friendly in Two Minutes, (2005); Informe Barómetro De Hábitos De Lectura Y Compra De Libros En 2010, (2010); La Sociedad De La Información En España 2010, (2010); Hanson C.W., Libraries and Mobile Services, (2011); Library Technology Reports, 47, 2; Hassan Y., Martin fernandez F.J., Iazza G., Diseño Web centrado en el usuario: Usabilidad y arquitectura de la información, Hipertext.

This study uses as a method to bibliometric analysis related to items such as publications, publication of periodicals, quotes, among others, with searches on data base Web of Science. Regarding the survey results it can be seen that the journals that publish more on innovation in information services are respectively Library Journal, College & Research Libraries and Journal of Academic Librarianship. It is noteworthy that the ten most cited articles, most, eight articles these are exploratory studies and two articles these are theoretical studies. And six of these were invested in university libraries. Among the topics analysis contexts we stand out studies on structural variables of libraries for innovation, economic environment, leadership profile, ability to take risks, ICTs as facilitators of innovation, best practices for innovation and the importance of diffusion of innovation in libraries. As final considerations can be seen that each study examines an aspect of innovation, and none of the studies can alone provide a definitive direction on how to improve innovation in information services. However, together, these studies can provide guidelines for creating or restructuring of an innovative information service.","Bibliometrics; Information services. libraries; Innovation; Technologies of information and communication","","","","","","","","Almeida M.C.B., Planejamento de Bibliotecas e Serviços de Informação, (2000); Amaral E.C.E., A TIC: Tecnologia da informação e comunicação na educação, Revista Belasartes, 7, (2011); Andreassi T., Porque é tão difícil inovar em serviços, TEC HOJE-uma Revista de Opinião, (2002); Barreto A.A., A eficiência técnica e econômica e a viabilidade de produtos e serviços de informação, Ciência da Informação, 25, 3, (1996); Bicas H.E.A., Rother E.T., Braga M.E.R., Fatores de impacto, outros índices bibliométricos e desempenhos acadêmicos, Arq Bras Oftalmol, 65, pp. 151-152, (2002); Browning H.L., Singelmann J., The transformation of the US labor force: The interaction of industry and occupation, Politics & Society, 8, 3-4, pp. 481-509, (1978); Castro Filho C.M., Vergueiro W., A permeabilidade das unidades de informação à gestão do conhecimento: O ambiente das bibliotecas especializadas brasileiras, Congresso Brasileiro de Biblioteconomia, Documentação e Informação, 21, (2005); Correa H.L., Caon M., Gestão de Serviços: Lucratividade por Meio de Operações e de Satisfação dos Clientes, (2008); Crossan M., Apaydin M., A multi-dimensional framework of organizational innovation: A systematic review of the literature, Journal of Management Studies, 47, 6, pp. 1154-1191, (2010); Damanpour F., Childers T., The adoption of innovations in public-libraries, Library & Information Science Research, 7, 3, pp. 231-246, (1985); Delica K.N., Elbeshausen H., Socio-cultural innovation through and by public libraries in disadvantaged neighbourhoods in Denmark: Concepts and practices, Information Research, 18, 3, (2013); Dholakia N., Mundorf N., Dholakia R.R., Novos serviços de informação e comunicação: Um quadro de referência estratégica, Ciência da Informação, 26, 3, (1997); Drake M.A., Olsen H.A., Economics of library innovation, Library Trends, 28, 1, pp. 89-105, (1979); Eckhardt M., Lemos A.C.F.V., O impacto da tecnologia da informação e Comunicação, Sociais e Humanas, 20, (2007); Falagas M.E., Pitsouni E.I., Malietzis G.A., Papps G., Comparison of PubMed, Scopus, web of science, and Google scholar: Strengths and weaknesses, The FASEB Journal, 22, 2, pp. 338-342, (2008); Figueiredo N., Inovação, produtividade e sistemas de informação, Ci.

Design: Content analysis. Setting: Job postings from six library-specific websites: the American Library Association, the Library & Information Technology Association, the Society of American Archivists, the Council on Library and Information Resources, the Association of Research Libraries, and Library Assessment job announcements at http://libraryassessment.info/?cat=13. Subjects: Job titles and descriptions published during an 18-month period between Summer 2012 and Winter 2013 that met the inclusion criteria (n=231). Methods: Job postings were searched and analyzed in two separate sets whose inclusion criteria is as follows: First, job postings with the term assessment in the position title or as the main focus of the position (n=44) were retrieved; of these, three postings were too old to contain descriptions, so were excluded from analysis. Second, job postings were retrieved with the terms assessment, evaluation, metrics, and strategic in the descriptive text of postings with position titles that did not specifically mention assessment (n=187). The full text of both sets was downloaded to ATLAS.ti software for analysis using a grounded theory approach. Mutually exclusive terms emerging from the coding process were documented and defined; from this analysis, networks of code ""families"" or co-relational groupings helped to create categories and sub-categories. The context of terms was closely examined to understand the meaning of assessment-related terms in job descriptions. Following this step, Microsoft Excel was used to generate tables and pivot tables, aiding understanding and illustrating data. Main Results: All 44 job posts containing the term assessment as part of the position title were from research universities or four year colleges; of these, most were ARL member libraries. For these postings, the concept of assessment was more clearly aligned with definitions of assessment as an ongoing process. The positions described, requiring a minimum of three years' of experience, ranged from entry-level to administrative in nature. In the second set (187 postings), the interchangeable use of the terms ""assessment"" and ""evaluation"" was particularly evident in job postings unrelated to library instruction. No library types other than academic were recruiting for assessment librarians, but related skills, usually referred to as evaluation in public and special libraries, were mentioned in all areas of library practice including instruction, administration, public services, user behavior, and to a lesser extent, access services, archives, information technology, cataloging, and more. While less prominent, these less often mentioned areas of practice also appear to be increasing their awareness of assessment. Key skills and knowledge areas needed for assessment in libraries emerged from content analysis of the job postings. These were grouped under eight main areas of competency and were augmented by the authors' own experiences as assessment librarians: background in library assessment, research methods, statistical and analytic skills, visualization and presentation skills, and project management and people skills. Conclusions: Based upon analysis of this set of documents, a culture of assessment in libraries appears to be emerging, demonstrating a possible upward trend when contrasted with the earlier research of Walter and Oakleaf (2010). Overall, assessment related skills and knowledge were increasingly evident across all library types and positions. Suggestions for aiding the development of an emerging culture of assessment include fostering liaisons between ALA divisions and library schools to persuade the schools of the need for related coursework, workshops focused on assessment-related skills, certification programs, and a proposed minor in library assessment. Opening avenues for discussion between library types could enhance the growth of an assessment culture beyond academic librarianship. Additional research to better understand the diffusion of assessment culture and practice into non-academic libraries is also recommended. © 2015 Tewell.","","","","","","","","","Glynn L., A critical appraisal tool for library and information research, Library Hi Tech, 24, 3, pp. 387-399, (2006); Perryman C., BibCAT: Evaluation tool for bibliometric studies, JotForm - Form Builder, (2014); Walter S., Oakleaf M., Recruiting for Results: Assessment Skills and the Academic Library Job Market, ARL Library Assessment Conference, (2010)","C.

The paper highlights the best practices, as well as continuing questions, in the field of embedded librarianship. Design/methodology/approach: The authors collected participant feedback in two active, participatory panel discussions at national conferences. The open forums were centered on three guiding themes of embedded librarianship: building connections with faculty and students; utilizing technology tools; and providing information literacy and assessment. Participants answered directed questions, and their responses were recorded and analyzed for this paper. Findings: Librarians report an increasing demand for library services in learning management systems. Collaboration and partnerships across campus are required for successful embedded librarian projects. Technology tools continue to evolve and change, and most librarians can anticipate using multiple learning management systems over time. There is an ongoing need for professional development in online library instruction and assessment. Originality/value: This paper provides a snapshot of the current state of embedded librarianship in learning management systems. It offers insights about what academic librarians value, what they have learned and what concerns they still have about library instruction in online environments. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Distance learning; Embedded librarianship; Information literacy; Learning management systems; Library instruction; Library services","","","","","","","","","","","Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.","","","","","","07419058","","","","English","Libr.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper explores five case studies of librarians and library professionals who have created online programs specifically geared to the field using technologies such as podcasting, YouTube channels, Twitter Chats, and Google Hangouts. The case studies include librarians in the public, academic, and school settings as well as one professional from The American Library Association. Interviews via Google Hangouts took place to gather information for each narrative. NVivo 10 qualitative data analysis software was used to pull out themes and commonalities among narratives. Some examples include, intended audience, program focus, platform topics, technology, and challenges. Findings: Face-to-face delivery of information and professional development can be difficult with librarians and professionals located across the USA and the world. These five interviewees share new opportunities and examples in the delivery of training and information in the field of librarianship without ever needing to leave an office or desk. Originality/value: Podcasting in librarianship is a topic of modest popularity but it is typically used with students and at the academic library level where the topics of podcasts and libraries are addressed. The topics of podcasts, online radio broadcasts, and other technologies in librarian peer-to-peer instruction and professional development are uncharted territory in the field of scholarly research.

As take-up of e-books has grown to achieve mass adoption, what industry analysts Gartner describe as the ""plateau of productivity"", the question of user acceptance may seem less relevant. However, if attention is switched from downloads to information behaviour, expectations and gratification, the picture of acceptance is more nuanced, with some studies pointing towards user disaffection.This paper reports on the information behaviour of another category of e-book users, i.e. apparently satisfied or intensive users. The paper is based on data analysis and interpretation of data from transaction logs generated by the Ebook Library (EBL) platform in an academic library. The paper forms part of a broader investigation of technology acceptance and options for improving the user experience of e-books within an academic library context. Three years of e-books transaction logs were mined for evidence of ""power user"" behaviour. The paper demonstrates how power user behaviour is different from other user behaviour, shows which variables determine such behaviour, and creates a probabilistic model that can determine a power user based on these variables. The paper also describes how this model was validated against the log data. © 2014 © 2014 Australian Library & Information Association.","data mining, evidence based librarianship; e-books; information behaviour; power user; super user","","","","","","","","Abdullah N., Gibb F., How Students Use E-books - Reading or Referring?, Malaysian Journal of Library & Information Science, 13, 2, pp. 1-14, (2008); Abdullah N., Gibb F., Students' Attitudes Towards E-books in a Scottish Higher Education Institute: Part 1, Library Review, 57, 8, pp. 593-605, (2008); Ahmad P., Brogan M., Scholarly Use of E-books in a Virtual Academic Environment: A Case Study, Australian Academic & Research Libraries, 43, 3, pp. 189-213, (2012); Al U., Soydal I., Tonta Y., Analysis of E-book Use: The Case of Ebrary, Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Electronic Publishing, pp. 315-329, (2010); Allen P., Bennett K., PASW Statistics by SPSS: A Practical Guide: Version 18.0, (2010); Armstrong C., Ray L., E-book Collections Management in UK Universities: Focus Group Report (Final Report), (2009); Ashcroft L., Ebooks in Libraries: An Overview of the Current Situation, Library Management, 32, 6-7, pp. 398-407, (2011); Bhattacherjee A., Understanding Information Systems Continuance: An Expectation-confirmation Model, MIS Quarterly, 25, 3, pp. 351-370, (2001); Borchert M., Clare T., Alison H., Macdonald D., A Study on Student and Staff Awareness, Acceptance and Usage of E-books at Two Queensland Universities, (2009); Burns B.R., Burns A.R., Business Research Methods and Statistics Using SPSS, (2008); Textual Analysis of Open Ended Questions in E-book National Observatory Survey, (2008); Scholarly E-book Usage and Information Seeking Behaviour: A Deep Log Analysis of MyiLibrary, (2009); Study on the Management and Economic Impact of E-textbook Business Models on Publishers, E-book Aggregators and Higher Education Institutions: Phase One Report (public version), (2009); Croft R., Davis C., E-books Revisited: Surveying Student E-book Usage in a Distributed Learning Academic Library 6 Years Later, Journal of Library Administration, 50, 5-6, pp. 543-569, (2010); 2011 Annual Report, (2012); Huthwaite A., Colleen E., Cleary B., Sinnamon P.S., McClintock A., Ebook Readers: Separating the Hype from Reality, (2011); Israel G.D., Determining Sample Size, (2009); JISC National E-books Observatory Project: Key Findings and Recommendations (Final Report), (2009); Lim S.-H., Kim S.-W., Park S., Lee J.H., Determining Content Power Users in a Blog Network: An Approach and its Applications, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, 41, 5, pp. 853-862, (2011); Malyn-Smith J., Guilfoy V., Power Users of Technology Research Initiative: 2001-2020, (2003); Marchionini G., Exploratory Search: From Finding to Understanding, Communications of the ACM, 49, 4, pp. 41-46, (2006); Ebooks Need Visibility, (2007); Nicholas D., Clark D., Rowlands I., Jamali H.R., Online Use and Information Seeking Behaviour: Institutional and Subject Comparisons of UK Researchers, Journal of Information Science, 35, 6, pp. 660-676, (2009); Nicholas D., Huntington P., Dobrowolski T., Rowlands I., Jamali H.R., Polydoratou P., Revisiting ""Obsolescence"" and Journal Article ""Decay"" Through Usage Data: An Analysis of Digital Journal Use by Year of Publication, Information Processing & Management, 41, 6, pp. 1441-1461, (2005); Nicholas D., Huntington P., Rowlands I., Dobrowolski T., Jamali H.R., Superbook, Proceedings of the Online Information Conference, pp. 50-57, (2007); Nicholas D., Rowlands I., Jamali H.R., E-textbook Use, Information Seeking Behaviour and its Impact: Case Study Business and Management, David, Ian Rowlands, and Hamid R.

Shiffman Medical Library, Michigan, United States","The disparity in access to information is a worldwide phenomenon. Global Information Inequalities offers a captivating look into problems of information access across the world today. One of the unique strengths of the book is the use of examples of library initiatives from around the world to illustrate the range of possibilities for equitable access and library service delivery in a global context. It contains numerous examples of a wide variety of information problems and solutions ranging from developing literacy programs in rural communities in Tanzania, building school libraries in China, making government-related information more transparent in Chile, to exploring how digital technologies have the potential to revolutionize the lives of people with sensory-disabilities. The contributions in Global Information Inequalities address a number of core professional issues, including access to information, library services, collection development, global collaboration, intellectual property, and digital information. The contributors are from Argentina, Canada, Chile, China, Iceland, Malaysia, Peru, South Africa, Tanzania, United States, and Zambia, thereby providing a wide range of perspectives on librarianship. Written in a simple, thorough, and multidisciplinary approach, the book presents and discusses key issues in various library settings and from different perspectives. Overall, this work contributes to a global examination and exploration of libraries in various parts of the world. This book has a wide appeal and is applicable to various library environments (including academic, public, and special libraries). © 2008 Woodhead Publishing Limited.

Libraries in our sample varied in their approaches to dealing with technological change, with institutional factors appearing to strongly shape their choice. Large, four-year academic libraries adopted a role reinvention approach that reduced reference librarians' desk hours and permitted librarians to follow creative, often technical, pursuits. Small, four-year academic libraries took a structural defense approach that maintained the sanctity of the reference desk as the locus for substantive reference questions. Two-year academic and public libraries followed a resigned surrender approach where reference librarians staffed busy desks and were inundated with patron requests to aid with computer equipment. We discuss the implications of each approach for the work of reference librarians. © 2012 by The University of Chicago.","","","","","","","","","Jennerich E.J., Jennerich E.Z., Teaching the Reference Interview, Journal of Education for Librarianship, 17, 2, pp. 106-111, (1976); Dervin B., Dewdney P., Neutral Questioning: A New Approach to the Reference Interview, Research Quarterly, 25, 4, pp. 506-513, (1986); Ross C.S., The Reference Interview: Why It Needs to Be Used in Every (Well, Almost Every) Reference Transaction, Reference and User Services Quarterly, 43, 1, pp. 38-43, (2003); Abels E.G., The E-mail Reference Interview, Reference Quarterly, 35, 3, pp. 345-358, (1996); Straw J.E., A Virtual Understanding: The Reference Interview and Question Negotiation in the Digital Age, Reference and User Services Quarterly, 39, 4, pp. 376-379, (2000); Westbrook L., Virtual Reference Training: The Second Generation, College & Research Libraries, 67, 3, pp. 249-259, (2006); Luo L., Toward Sustaining Professional Development: Identifying Essential Competencies for Chat Reference Service, Library and Information Science Research, 30, 4, pp. 298-311, (2008); Martell C., The Elusive User: Changing Use Patterns in Academic Libraries, 1995 to 2004, College & Research Libraries, 68, 5, pp. 435-445, (2007); Applegate R., Whose Decline?

It cites data from the American Library Association's State of America's Libraries (2010d) report. Issues discussed include library usage, library funding, the adaptation of new technologies, the profession of librarianship, the struggle to preserve public access to information, and the future prospects of libraries. The chapter discusses each of these issues in relation to public, academics, and school libraries, citing comparative data on funding and the adoption of new technologies for each type of library. Acknowledging that reality to libraries is not technological, but perceptual and political, discussion focuses on the growing role of advocacy and specific strategies that have proven successful in securing and/or preserving support for libraries. A number of commonly held myths are also examined, many of which are detrimental to libraries or inhibit our ability to respond to the issues and trends that are affecting libraries. The author concludes with some observations about the historic development of libraries, their continuing relevance in an era of rapid technological change, the need to look beyond short-term concerns and to closely examine and/or reject popular myths as we create libraries of the future. © 2011 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","""Mega"" issues; Advocacy; Funding; Future trends; Libraries","","","","","","","","School Libraries Count!

This is done in an attempt to determine the value of a new approach of faculty-librarian collaboration for promoting the library's resources and services. In addition, some ideas and suggestions are proposed regarding the issue of faculty-librarian collaboration for library staff around the world. Design/methodology/approach - After providing some background information regarding the JUST Library, the process of the project implementation and the approaches used are described in detail. In addition, the effectiveness of the project is reviewed based on the results of the interviews with some of the teaching faculty and the statistics reports of the usage of the JUST Library from 2006 to 2008. Finally, some conclusions are drawn and some suggestions are made, proposing that the library staff establish a faculty-librarian collaborative model. Findings - After reviewing the effectiveness of the project, it is hard to say whether or not it is the best way to promote the library's services and resources. However, the paper finds that the proposed approach provides a new idea and an example of faculty-librarian collaboration in promoting the library's resources and services to the students.

Design/methodology/approach: The Human Performance Technology (HPT) model created by the International Society for Performance Improvement (ISPI) was used to identify employee performance issues in a newly created Learning Commons at a mid-size academic library. Findings: Applying the HPT model to a Learning Commons enabled the authors to identify organizational and employee performance issues and identify solutions to these issues. The HPT model was deemed a useful tool for addressing performance issues. Research limitations/implications: Little research has been published using the HPT model in libraries and more research should be performed to determine the suitability of this model for libraries. It should be acknowledged that the model is used to identify weaknesses and any organization using this model will likely uncover areas for improvement. Practical implications: The HPT model provides a method to identify measurable performance indicators which could be used to set standards of performance for employees. Setting such standards can help achieve and maintain levels of high quality for any library service. This model is particularly useful when employees at one service point may include a combination of student workers, paraprofessionals, and librarians. Originality/value: The study could identify only one article in the relevant literature addressing the use of the HPT model in a library setting.

Local in-house databases that were developed in the Caribbean around the 1990's have not incorporated these new changes and in recent years there have been an increasing number of scientific commercial database providers that have embraced this new technology. As a result, many persons now question the validity and relevance of local in-house databases in today's changing technological environment. This paper will focus on three Caribbean scientific databases, Caribbean Environmental Network (CAREN), Caribbean Disaster Information Network (CARDIN) and MEDCARIB that are available at the University of the West Indies Library, Mona Campus. The coverage of Caribbean scientific issues in these Caribbean databases were compared with four commercial databases, EBSCO - Academic Search Premier, OCLC First Search - Wilson Select Plus, Proquest, and SciFinder Scholar. The paper sought to validate why Caribbean databases are still relevant in an age where information is readily available globally.

Harris (2016) used the trends and issues reported by the ACRL to inform a document and thematic analysis of publications written on Jamaican academic librarianship 2010-2016, to investigate the trends and issues in Jamaican academic librarianship. Harris’ (2016) paper however noted that a survey of the chief librarian in each library, regarding their perceptions of the trends and issues would be a useful follow-up to her study, and cited this as a limitation/implication of her paper. The purpose of this paper is to address the above limitation and is therefore the follow-up to Harris’ (2016) paper. Design/methodology/approach: The chief librarians in five of the six local university libraries were surveyed to provide insights into the trends and issues in Jamaican academic libraries at the university level. Findings: Acquisitions, budget, staffing, communicating value, digital preservation and curation, mobile environment, collaboration, scholarly communication, information technology, space, higher education, user behaviour and expectations and information literacy are the top trends and issues in Jamaican academic libraries at the university level. Research limitations/implications: This survey seeks to complement rather than contest Harris’ (2016) research. Perhaps a useful follow-up to both papers would be biennial updates. Additionally, a survey of the trends and issues in all types of academic libraries throughout the English-speaking Caribbean would be a useful follow-up. Originality/value: This paper is of value, as it is the first survey of trends and issues in Jamaican academic librarianship. It enriches the existing document and thematic analytical research on trends and issues in Jamaican academic libraries by adding an empirical component. It also increases the number of publications, on trends and issues in Jamaican academic librarianship, from one to two, and allows voices from the English-speaking Caribbean (Jamaica) to be incorporated into the literature dedicated to trends and issues in academic libraries. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Academic library issues; Academic library trends; Caribbean academic libraries; Caribbean university libraries; Jamaican academic libraries; Jamaican university libraries","","","","","","","","Top trends in academic libraries: a review of the current literature, College & Research Library News, 71, 6, pp. 286-292, (2010); Top ten trends in academic libraries: a review of the trends and issues affecting academic libraries in higher education, College & Research Library News, 73, 6, pp. 311-320, (2012); Top trends in academic libraries: a review of the trends and issues affecting academic libraries in higher education, College & Research Library News, 75, 6, pp. 294-302, (2014); top trends in academic libraries: a review of the trends and issues affecting academic libraries in higher education, College & Research Library News, 77, 6, pp. 274-281, (2016); Gwyer R., Identifying and exploring future trends impacting on academic libraries: a mixed methodology using journal content analysis, focus groups, and trend reports, New Review of Academic Librarianship, 21, 4, pp. 269-285, (2015); Harris S., Enhancing awareness of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) in academic libraries: a Jamaican case study, IFLA Journal, 39, 3, pp. 251-261, (2013); Harris S., Trends and issues in Jamaican academic libraries 2010-2016, New Library World, 117, 11-12, pp. 721-745, (2016); Hurst S., Current trends in UK university libraries, New Library World, 114, 9-10, pp. 398-407, (2013); IFLA Trends report, (2013); IFLA Trend report 2016 update, (2016); A snapshot of priorities and perspectives: UK academic libraries, (2012); Economic and social survey of Jamaica 2015: overview, (2015); Strauss A.L., Qualitative Analysis for Social Scientists, (1987); Research data services, (2016)","S.

Communication is the essence of reference librarianship, and a practically endless array of synchronous and asynchronous communication tools (ICTs) are available to facilitate communication. This study relied on a phenomenological methodology, which included nine in-depth interviews with academic librarians. The interviews were transcribed and analyzed using RQDA, a qualitative analysis software package that facilitates coding, category building, and project management. Seven themes about librarianship emerged from this research: attending to communication abundance, librarians of two types, instruction not reference, twenty-first century librarianship, user needs, trusted methods: filter not retrieve, and self-impact. The shared meaning of communication overload among these librarians is that it is a problem when it detracts from or hinders their ability to assist their users. Further research should contribute to an understanding of communication as a problem when it interferes with serving the librarians' users, or to an understanding of interpersonal communication within the librarians' organizational structures and in their broader professional networks. Research in popular psychology has focused on the negative impacts on productivity and concentration of living in an always-plugged-in environment. This research confirms that librarians should have time to work away from digital distractions to maintain job satisfaction. Important work by Radford and Dervin has focused on communication with users. This study focuses on the impact of ICTs on librarians' work and personal lives. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Academic libraries; Communication; Communication technologies; Information technology; Knowledge workers; Librarians; Phenomenology; Reference services","","","","","","","","Anderson E.H., Spencer M.H., Cognitive representations of AIDS: a phenomenological study, Qualitative Health Research, 12, 10, pp. 1338-1352, (2002); Bawden D., Robinson L., The dark side of information: overload, anxiety and other paradoxes and pathologies, Journal of Information Science, 35, 2, pp. 180-191, (2008); Bernet R., Kern I., Marback E., An Introduction to Husserlian Phenomenology, (1993); Budd J., Phenomenology and information studies, Journal of Documentation, 61, 1, pp. 44-59, (2005); Carr N., Is Google making us stupid?

This one-of-a-kind book provides a daily diary of every librarian/patron transaction-no matter how mundane or absurd-to demonstrate not only how advances in technology have affected the reference librarian's job, but how the public's expectations have changed, as well. The book also includes observations by a now-retired reference librarian on the current state of the field based on these unedited interactions. Over the past two decades, the job of reference librarian has seen many changes. But in many ways, reference desk work hasn't changed a bit, with its mix of odd, humorous, routine, and ridiculous requests that capture what it's like to deal with patrons day after day. Reference Librarianship paints a clear picture of the field for library school students, provides emotional and philosophical support to practitioners, and reminds library administrators of what life was like on the ""front lines."" A sampling of the daily transactions documented in Reference Librarianship: Monday, May 19, 2003: • pencil • pencil • network down • I tell people that I can't sign them up for an Internet terminal because the network is down and they just stand there, staring into space • One of them asks for three days worth of newspapers • microfiche machine explanation • Sorry, Sir, the network is still down (multiply by twenty and insert randomly into the remainder of the day) • magic tricks, but he pretty much knew where they were • One of our large interior plate glass windows shattered. No one was hurt and it made a fascinating noise, like a crystal waterfall landing on soil. • ""Books on prostitution, you know-whores?"" • Someone from the County called to ask if any criminal activity had occurred on a particular street. Someone else referred her to us. She was dubious-with good reason. • ""Math puzzles."" Okay. I show him the books. • ""Just math."" Certainly. I show him the books. • ""I need them in Spanish."" Grrr ... Reference Librarianship is an enlightening, educational, and entertaining look at the real world of reference desk work. It's an essential read for reference librarians (both public and academic), library administrators, and library school students, as well as anyone who works with the public. © 2006 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

It also describes the current situation of librarianship in independent Lithuania. Historical analysis shows that Lithuanian libraries status, level and rate of development are influenced by particular historical conditions, social, and economical demands of the society. During the first stages of their history, Lithuanian libraries were a valuable part of the whole European library history. Their activities subsided when Lithuania lost its independence. This eliminated libraries from the national historical process. After Lithuania regained its independence, it became possible for libraries to recover. Unfortunately this process had subsided during the Soviet years. Society depreciated library activities and librarians work. Nevertheless, librarianship of this period has some achievements also. There is a rather good system of library education, several library networks and scientific research in library and information science. The last period is very hard and difficult for Lithuanian librarianship. During the years of economic crisis, libraries must struggle for their existence. So we can speak only about the possibility to ensure minimal conditions of existence, about the possibility to survive. The technical basis of libraries is especially weak: few of them use computerized technologies. This new period of the Lithuanian library development raised new problems and sharpened the old ones. The Lithuanian state has to change the library system and its functions, and rearrange library activities. The current situation in Lithuania creates new premises for libraries to develop. The most important premise of these changes is restoration of Lithuanian independence. A lot of work is already done to deideologize library activities, and to consolidate in them the principles of democracy. This work must guarantee the right of all Lithuanian citizens to use information stored in libraries. Now Lithuanian libraries strive to restore and establish new international relations, and to integrate themselves into the world’s information system. © 1994 Academic Press Limited.","","","","","","","","","Jogaila S.A., Kaunas, (1935); Vladimirovas L., Knygos istorija.

This prediction is reflected in today's information-intense world. Due to the rapid development of technology, the library profession faces an uncertain future. Library professionals must use insight to identify technology's potential to benefit the academic library's role in the twenty-first century. This paper focuses on the human-machine connection between academic librarians and Web mining technology with respect to electronic reference service. The connection is featured in processes of: (a) identifying problems of electronic reference service; (b) selecting a technology to solve the problem; and, (c) envisioning the potential of the selected technology for librarianship. Scenarios address pertinent questions, including: (a) What role should librarians play to facilitate implementation of a technology? and, (b) What opportunities do technology offer to the profession in return?

The author proposes that health sciences librarians can participate in the creative process of constructing their professional future by being informed, expanding cooperative efforts, planning, ceasing a romanticized view of the profession, and becoming achievers rather than sustainers.","","Computers; Forecasting; Human; Information Services; Libraries, Medical; Publishing; United States; adolescent; adult; biological model; education; environmental health; library; methodology; prevention; psychological aspect; review; school child","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00257338","","BMLAA","7437586","English","BULL.

This shortage is affecting staffing levels at libraries and making it increasingly difficult to fill positions. Pollock (2002) reported that libraries across the nation are facing the same dilemma, ""how to fill the growing number of vacancies in the ranks of professional librarians"" (p. 94). There are several explanations for this trend. There is a phenomenon known as the graying of the profession. A large number of academic librarians are nearing retirement age and new librarians will be needed to replace them. Crosby (2001) stated that ""many experienced librarians are expected to retire, switch occupations, or leave the occupation permanently for other reasons. This will create about 39,000 job openings for new librarians between 1998 and 2008"" (p. 9). Wilder (2000) reported, ""In demographic terms, librarianship in North America is a profession apart. Librarians are, as a group, substantially older than those in comparable professions, and they are aging at a much faster rate"" (para. 1). Lynch (2002) reported that over 20% of the librarians currently employed in the United States will reach age 65 by 2014. Another relatively new situation is the competition for academic librarians. Dolan and Schumacher (1997) stated, ""Opportunities have never been better for the librarian in a non-traditional setting. The Internet and cutting-edge information technology have created new jobs"" (p. 68). Librarians now have several job choices outside of the traditional library setting to consider. Kaufman (2002) states, ""It appears that, in recent years, smaller percentages of students pursuing graduate degrees in library and information science have moved into traditional libraries. New opportunities in the private sector, albeit slowing slightly but temporarily in the current economy, appear to be luring more graduates with the promise of interesting work and robust salaries"" (para. 4). The number of graduate schools that award the Master's degree in library science (MLS) has declined in the past two decades. During the past 20 years ALA went from accrediting 83 graduate programs in the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico to 58 (O'Neill, 2002). Stieg (1991) explains that library science programs were closed because ""They have few sources of outside funding and a relatively limited market for the kind of research they might sell. Their alumni are not likely to make fortunes and become generous benefactors"" (p. 270). Librarianship has historically been a female dominated profession. In today's society women are going into a much wider variety of careers though and are leaving a shortage in occupations such as teaching, nursing, and librarianship. While women are branching out into new careers, librarianship remains a female dominated profession. The latest statistical data shows that women hold 83.4% of the jobs in the field (U.S. Census Bureau, 2003). Proof of the librarian shortage lies in the number of job openings and difficulty that libraries are having filling advertised positions. Judith Robinson, professor and chair of Library and Information Studies at SUNY Buffalo is quoted as saying, ""Administrators of school, university, and public libraries are beating the bushes to locate qualified applicants to fill thousands of vacancies. Many urban libraries can't staff new branches, and small-town libraries, sometimes hobbled by lower salaries, can remain unstaffed for years"" (Jacobson, 2002). O'Connor and Marien (2002) studied the job market for business librarians for one year and examined 96 job searches. They found that applicant pools averaged just 7.7 minimally qualified librarians per position and that 70% of the employers were dissatisfied with their pools. The top three reasons for their dissatisfaction were the quantity, quality, and the qualifications of the candidates (2002). ALA's (2004) conference placement statistics indicate that there were more job openings posted then the number of job applicants at their mid-winter and annual conferences from 1998 to 2002. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Within the US government, our relations with other peoples of the world was coined as public diplomacy, as opposed to official diplomacy between governments, by the Kennedy administration. Despite strains in US relations with other countries, international opinion polls mostly show that Americans are still admired, even as there are disagreements with US policies (Pew Research Center for People and the Press, 2003; What the World Thinks, 2004). Since the terror attacks of 11 September 2001 [9/11], the American public has become more aware of the image of the US overseas and the problems that image has. If left only to movies, television, music videos and CNN, the impression of America is likely to be distorted. Misunderstandings of US society, the reasoning goes, are the basis for many people around the world, particularly young people, to dislike Americans and feel compelled to challenge us (Beers, 2002; U.S. Tries to Beautify, 2002; Tutwiler, 2004). In the soul searching that took place after the attacks, criticisms were leveled at the US government for its failure to conduct effective public diplomacy. Among the litany of complaints by the many commissions, studies, articles, reports, etc. are that cultural exchanges, such as artistic and cultural ambassador programs were cut and that many print publications were eliminated (Advisory Group on Public Diplomacy for the Arab and Muslim World, 2003; Center for Arts & Culture, 2004; Making the Case to the World, 2003; United States National Advisory Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, 2004; Public Diplomacy Council, 2005). Most of these reports also lament that over the last 20 years many of the libraries we established for local people around the world are now closed or for all intents and purposes shut to the public in order to focus on services for the elite, decision-making level of societies. How can foreign publics get to know us if we have drastically reduced our presence overseas? What role can libraries play in the confrontation against terror? Does open access to information provide a wedge against extremist views among impressionable youth? Americans may take for granted that well stocked and equipped libraries are necessary to democracy and to enterprise. Our schools, universities, private organizations and municipalities have libraries that are focal points for their institutions or their communities. In foreign countries, US embassy libraries or Information Resource Centers (IRCs) provide overseas publics with access to current and authoritative information about the US, providing a service that modestly mirrors what Americans have on home soil. Libraries and IRCs of US embassies are one of the many tools of US diplomacy overseas that engage the public. They provide a service that is a unique exception to other sections of US missions abroad, by responding to queries from the public for information they need for their own work, professional or personal goals. As with any organization, it is the creativity and dedication of the staff, adapting to change and making the best use of resources, that makes the program successful. IRC staff use electronic and print resources to answer complex queries and up to date technologies to distribute information. They prepare outreach products that are highly regarded by host country users (Quan, 1998). United States embassy libraries have had their critics over the years. Conservatives accused the United States Information Service (USIS, the overseas name for the United States Information Agency or USIA) libraries of holding books and documents in their collections that did not sufficiently support the policy viewpoint of the administration, particularly during the Cold War (Drummond, 1953, 1). Academics complained that USIS libraries in the 1960s in India had ""bland"" collections (Boewe, 2004, 25). On the left, they are criticized for being primarily a propaganda tool for US imperialist policies overseas, rather than a library with range of ideas, in the American mold (Rosenzweig, 2003, 10). The reality is more benign. According to the Foreign Affairs Manual ""The information resource base available through an IRC should be balanced and representative of the prominent currents of past and contemporary US thought ..."" (United States Department of State, 2005). Critics who actually visit embassy libraries and IRCs overseas, look at the collections, and speak to local patrons who the service is intended for may find that the embassy libraries and IRCs are (or were) one of the most popular services provided by the US government, and are considered a great loss if they were closed (Jones, 1997). Depending on the host country, the IRC staff may be a respected member of a local library community and information sector. In a closed society, the IRC may be a refuge where readers have the possibility of free and open access to a diversity of opinion. In poor developing countries an IRC may be the only or one of the only locations to provide access to current information, in print and electronically. This article describes some challenges IRC staffs have faced over the last 30 years. It follows the diversity of the responses and accommodations from different corners of the globe to external challenges, to changing information technology throughout the system and in librarianship, and to changing directives and funding from within the headquarters in Washington that mandate the program. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

For over 500 years, the state of libraries and librarianship has been a reliable measure of varying degrees of freedom and subjugation in these countries. Traces the influences of religion, academic and private collections, Russian rule and the emergence of nationalism, the development of professional librarianship, independence following World War 1, and domination by the Soviet Union. Shows not only the effects of politics on libraries but also their counterbalancing role. Documents past preoccupations with Soviet propaganda and censorship with a view to assessing the current state of libraries as they enter a new era of political freedom, information technology and co-operation. Notes specific projects aimed at establishing Web sites and online public access catalogues (OPACs) in individual countries. Concludes that the fundamental steps to developing Baltic library networks and to decentralize the library system have been firmly established.

The generous financial assistance provided by the Netherlands Library Development Project (Pakistan) further accelerated the pace in this regard. However, the libraries in Pakistan have not registered any significant progress. Automated systems are lacking in large university libraries, as well as in college and public libraries. The largest group using this technology is specialist libraries. These libraries use automation primarily for a few selected operations. Some private sector universities have taken steps towards the planning and implementation of integrated library systems, but these are still in the trial stages. The National Library in Pakistan has also just made similar steps. The UNESCO sponsored CDS/ISIS is the most commonly used software; other popular packages used include ORACLE and INMAGIC. Some indigenous systems have also been developed, but without much success. IBM 386 and IBM 486 compatibles are used by the vast majority of libraries. Computer application education is yet to be introduced to schools by the country’s library. The major constraints on library automation include: absence of planning, non-availability of software, import restriction on choice of hardware, lack of competent manpower, nonexistence of standard, absence of co-operation etc. © 1998 Academic Press.","","","","","","","Foundation for the Advancement of Science and Technology; Institute of Computer Science; Netherlands Library Development Project; Pakistan Library Association; United States Agency for International Development, USAID; Asia Foundation; Foundation for Angelman Syndrome Therapeutics, FAST; University Grants Commission, UGC","Funding text 1: Commission by incorporating more courses on information science.

The very suggestion of it is often called in question because of the difficulties experienced in general in the 'transfer of technologies', and because traditional librarianship has had a clear duty to employ low-paid labor. Capital expenditure on computer systems and hardware can hardly pay for itself through saving on recurrent labor charges - the justification as always, is not so much in staff savings but in redeployment (into non-automated areas) and in greater productivity, and without increase in staff. The introduction of automation is a matter development, of job enhancement and personal skills for those involved. For academic libraries it should be a matter of justification in terms of their own development (and research) as well as in terms of improved services to offer, that they can integrate advanced procedures into their general operations. It is of course, necessary to import the right sort of technology and that is where attention should be directed.","","INFORMATION SERVICES; LIBRARIES; DOCUMENTATION SERVICES; INDIGENOUS PUBLICATIONS; NEW AND ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY INTRODUCTION; INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS","","","","","","","","","","North-Holland Publ Co (FID Publ 662)","FID, The Hague, Neth","Challenge of Information Technology, Proceedings of the Forty-First FID Congress.","","Hong Kong","4929","","0444866469","","","English","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0020871248"

These include information technology, the role of the library as place, users’ values, and users’ naïveté about the complexity of information. Significant user values include immediacy, interactivity, personalization, and mobility. In order to develop services that respond to users’ need, librarians need to develop an anthropological understanding of their user communities. They also need to play a significant role in developing information systems. These need to provide personalized service. These ideas are not new; however, information technology has advanced to a point where they can be applied both practically and effectively. As librarians take a larger role in adapting information technologies to meet users’ information needs in ways that respond to their values, reference service must remain user-centered; high-tech and high touch are equally important. © 2003, MCB UP Limited","Academic libraries; Information technology; Librarianship; Libraries; Personal needs; Reference services","","","","","","","","Bush V., As we may think, Atlantic Monthly, 176, pp. 101-108, (1945); Campbell J.D., Shaking the conceptual foundations of reference: a perspective, Reference Services Review, 20, pp. 29-35, (1992); Green S.S., Personal relations between librarians and readers, American Library Journal, 1, (1876); LaGuardia C., Journal of Academic Librarianship, 21, (1995); Ranganathan S.R., The Five Laws of Library Science, (1931); Rettig J., Self-determining information seekers, RQ, 32, pp. 158-163, (1992); Tapscott D., Growing up Digital: The Rise of the Net Generation, (1998)","","","","","","","","","00907324","","","","English","Ref.

Scholars have always sought learning wherever it might be found and they have now been joined by researchers in the sciences and industry as in the humanities. International librarianship is a more realistic concept today than at any time in the past because of its heavy dependence on information systems and technology. Both the historical and technical aspects of internationalism affect national libraries. Their special features, the antiquity and size of their collections and their academic environment have led to an emphasis on in-house training and to a lack of staff mobility. But national libraries also have responsibility for national bibliographies, authoritative cataloguing records and the curation of non-print materials. The increasing role of information strategy systems/information technology (ISS/IT) has brought into national libraries a new professional staff whose influence has permeated a conservative environment. The need for the academic, scholarly research librarian remains, but to this must be allied the librarian trained within and for the profession in general. The synthesis has occurred in printed books departments and is developing increasingly in rare books, manuscript and cartographic divisions. Such development is essential if national libraries are to play a full part in collaborative, resource-sharing schemes and in networked systems. © 1993 IOS Press.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","01678329","","","","English","Educ Inf","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84974750447"

Although already dated in terns of its appearance, its recommendations have implications for academic librarianship which will only be fully felt and truly appreciated by the end of the century. The report is discussed in the context of British university libraries, their funding and relationship with their parent bodies, so that its full impact can be understood. The recommendations amount to an injection of some f200 million into the system aimed at protecting traditional librarianship on the one hand and promoting the new technology on the other. The report made the radical assumption that there will be some universities which only teach and some which cany out teaching and research, supported respectively by “access” and “holdings” libraries. It foresaw no immediate change in the pattern of traditional librarianship but its discussions and recommendations on publishing, on the access, transfer and storage of infonation, on the all-embracing role of Information Technology, leave little room for the status quo in the new millennium. The committee members were representative of scholarship both from within and from outside the university system with librarians clearly in the minority. The recommendations have virtually all been accepted by the Funding Councils which commissioned the report. © 1996 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

Summarizes the principal findings of two questionnaire surveys of graduates of the MA in Librarianship programme, undertaken in Summer 1994 as unpublished MA thesis work. One survey investigated former students who graduated between 1986 and 1989 while the other surveyed all former students thought to be still resident in the UK and Republic of Ireland (and one now resident in the USA). The same questionnaire was used in both surveys. Where possible, the results from both surveys were collated and, where appropriate, related to the earlier surveys for 1979-1985. Information was sought about: the first and subsequent posts taken up by graduates (including unemployment, wastage and mobility); their duties and responsibilities; opinions on the value and relevance of the MA programme and their pre programme experience to their career; factors affecting job satisfaction; their continuing professional development needs; acquisition of new skills; and their involvement with professional organizations. Concludes that the majority of graduates surveyed are still working in the library and information field and are generally satisfied with their career choice. However, there is some dissatisfaction with the perceived low status accorded to librarians and information workers and with poor salary levels. A substantial number have left or are actively considering leaving the profession. While the majority are still working in academic and public libraries, there has been a noticeable decline in those working in public libraries and a corresponding increase in employment in special libraries and in the information technologies (the 'emerging market'). Respondents expressed a need for more training in management and information technology and for more geographically distributed and cheaper short courses. It was felt that library schools could play a bigger role in continuing education of its own graduates through update and distance learning courses.","","","","","","","","","Bowden V.M., Olivier E.R., The first professional position: Expectations of academic health science library employers, Bulletin of the Medical Library Association, 83, 2, pp. 238-239, (1995); Bray F., Turner C., Monitoring the Library and Information Workforce, (1991); Burke M.E., Out with the old, in with the new?

Libraries have become an industry rather than a localized phenomenon, and librarianship has developed from a scholarly craft to a scientific profession. The essays in this volume present a picture of great diversity, covering public, national, academic, subscription and private libraries. The users of libraries are an important part of their history and are considered here in detail, alongside the development of the library profession and the impact of new information technologies. © Cambridge University Press 2006.","","","","","","","","","Abbott A., The system of professions, (1988);

Essentially everything in and around the library is changing: services, technologies, organizational constructs, ownership and access policies, values and most of the rest” (Riggs, 1997). Invariably this intensity of change will cause conflict on different scales and levels and have serious implications for Library and Information Services. Between 1996 and 1998 the eLib IMPEL2 (Impact on People of Electronic Libraries) project was able to monitor how this conflict was being manifested. Using literature from both the management and librarianship disciplines, the general concepts of conflict are discussed, focusing on causes of conflict, positive and negative impacts and different conflict handling techniques. There is an overview concerning how the theories and ideas on conflict drawn from the management discipline apply within an academic library context. After outlining the background to the IMPEL2 eLib project, examples of conflict found in academic libraries are illustrated using data collected. In February 1999 examples of conflict were reviewed at a study day for librarians who identified causes and possible conflict management strategies.

Yet we are also products of colonial legacies which have engendered Western domination to the detriment of Africans. Can librarians from the West contribute to sustainable democratic futures by supporting the catalytic role of librarians in Africa who strive to support African-centered scholarship and struggles against legacies of colonialism? Or will we re-inscribe colonial legacies through our partnerships and promotion of Western centered models? Based upon the author’s tour of selected higher education settings and academic libraries in Kenya and South Africa in 2001, the author reflects upon libraries in the context of “development” in Africa. The author begins to discern potentially viable models and develop criteria for partnerships by comparing methods of advocacy, collaboration and projects for information and digital futures. Descriptions of efforts to “build capacity” within African librarianship include those of African librarians and their associations, The Association of African Universities (AAU), The Africana Librarians Council (ALC), The World Bank, and The International Network for the Availability of Scientific Publications (INASP). The author observed the marketing of technology in Africa and characterizes some of the privileged dialogue on Information Communication Technologies (ICT) as the exportation of “technolust” which the author argues, contributes to increased privatization and the sacrifice of support to public universities. Such privatization reduces the broad social role of librarians and further marginalizes reference services. The author identifies critical literacies and sharing of cross-continental experience as essential in creating “mutually beneficial partnerships” to support cooperative, sustainable, democratic, information futures. In an effort to continue this important conversation and develop “true partnerships, ” the author shares her experience and reflection. Calls for dialogue throughout the African diaspora and beyond to promote community-based, democratic education and a sustainable intellectual, reading culture in Africa are recommended. © 2004 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","African publishing; Aid and development discourse; Higher education; Libraries; Models for sustainable digital futures; Partnerships","","","","","","","","African Studies Information Resources Directory; Ajayi G.O., Information and communications technologies, Paper Presented at the 10Th Association of African Universities (AAU) General Conference, (2001); Altheide D.L., Creating Fear: News and the Construction of Crisis, (2002); Amutabi M.N., Crisis and student protest in universities in Kenya, African Studies Review, 45, 2, pp. 157-177, (2002); Ang C., Das H., Dobbie A., Kent S., The Public Library-Idea, Cyberplace, Physical Presence, (2001); Dissertations and Theses in Africa Database (DATAD); Association of College and Research Libraries, and SPARC.

At the macro (economic and sociological) level, authors such as Fritz Machlup and Daniel Bell have outlined the shape of a supposed new order. In modern librarianship and information work, too, the effects of informatization have been pervasive. The paper articulates a simple synthetic theory of post-war informatization with special reference to information services in libraries, and specifically computerized information retrieval. It is suggested, on the basis of primary and secondary research, that the “story” of informatization can be broken down into four electronic epochs: offline, online, CDROM, and the Internet. Each epoch is described and evaluated, focusing on the practical effects on British librarians (national, academic, and public) and their patrons. It is hoped that the use of primary sources enables the account to capture something of the sense of revolution accompanying the arrival of new epochs. Advice on a future fifth “e”poch is not supplied, but it is acknowledged that the prospects for a global reference system seem more hopeful than ever before. © 2003, MCB UP Limited","Information retrieval; Information technology; Internet; Libraries","","","","","","","","Akeroyd J., CD-ROM usage and prospects: an overview, Program, 23, 4, pp. 367-376, (1989); Akeroyd J., Foster A., Online information services in UK academic libraries, Online Review, 3, 2, pp. 195-204, (1979); Batt C., Information Technology in Public Libraries, (1998); Batt C., I Have Seen the Future and IT Works!: The Second Ameritech Information Society Lecture, (1998); Bell D., The Coming of Post-Industrial Society: A Venture in Social Forecasting, (1974); Borgman C.L., From Gutenberg to the Global Information Infrastructure: Access to Information in the Networked World, (2000); Brown D.J., Electronic Publishing and Libraries: Planning for the Impact and Growth to 2003, (1996); Brownrigg E.B., Lynch C.A., Electrons, electronic publishing, and electronic display, Information Technology and Libraries, 4, 3, pp. 201-207, (1985); Castells M., The Rise of the Network Society, (2001); Day M.P., Electronic publishing and academic libraries, British Journal of Academic Librarianship, 1, 1, pp. 53-70, (1986); Dialog, (1999); Foskett A.C., Computers in libraries, Five Years’ Work in Librarianship 1961-1965, pp. 456-467, (1968); Holmes P.L., On-line Information Retrieval: an Introduction and Guide to the British Library's Short-Term Experimental Information Network, 2, (1977); Jamieson D.R., Mechanized bibliographical aid, Library Association Record, 53, pp. 216-221, (1951); Kimber R.T., Computer applications in the fields of library housekeeping and information processing, Program, 1, 6, pp. 5-25, (1967); CD-ROM: The New Papyrus, (1986); Lancaster F.W., Toward Paperless Information Systems, (1978); Law D., CD-ROM: a young technology with a great future behind it?, Serials, 3, 3, pp. 34-35, (1990); Law D., The development of a national policy for dataset provision in the UK: a historical perspective, Journal of Information Networking, 1, 2, pp. 103-116, (1994); Library Association Record Special library notes: information retrieval, Library Association Record, 59, pp. 173-174, (1957); Machlup F., The Production and Distribution of Knowledge in the United States, (1962); Porat M.U., The Information Economy, (1977); Program, Program, 1, 1, (1966); Sharp J.R., Information retrieval, Handbook of Special Librarianship and Information Work, pp. 141-232, (1967); Taylor L.J., British Librarianship and Information Work, (1982); UKOLOG, Newsletter, 4, (1979); Vickery A., The clash of interests in computer information services, Information Processing and Management, 14, 1, pp. 37-43, (1978); Vickery A., Batten A., Large-scale Evaluation Study of On-line and Batch Computer Information Services, (1978); Vickery B.C., The future of libraries in the machine age, Library Association Record, 68, pp. 252-260, (1966); Vickery B.C., The Use of On-line Search in Teaching: an Assessment of Projects Carried Out by UK Schools of Library and Information Studies, (1977); British Librarianship and Information Science 1971-1975, (1977); Whatmore G., Special library notes, Library Association Record, 57, pp. 359-361, (1955)","","","","","","","","","00242535","","","","English","Libr.

The challenges faced by librarians considering the move from academic to public librarianship can be equally and significantly demanding. To most outsiders, at least on the surface, it may appear to be a quick and easy transition to make, but some professional librarians recognize the distinct differences between these areas of librarianship. Although the ubiquitous nature of technology has brought the various work responsibilities of academic and public librarians closer together during the last decade, there remain key differences in job-related duties and the work environments. These dissimilarities pose meaningful hurdles to leap for academic librarians wishing to migrate to the public sector. By examining the variations between academic and public librarianship, academic librarians may find the transition to public librarianship less intimidating. Public libraries have a long history of educational and cultural involvement with the communities they serve. In the earliest days, and even well into the twentieth century, many public libraries were constructed with private funds on the condition that library services were provided to the general public at no cost to the library user. Educators, business professionals, politicians, and other civic leaders firmly believed that there was a direct correlation between the provision of free library services and a literate populace and a free society (Kemp, 1999, p. 116). This philosophy is still adhered to today and serves as the foundation for many services provided by public libraries, especially small to medium-sized facilities. In order to better comprehend what is involved in pursuing a career in public librarianship, an understanding of public library in comparison to academic library organization is essential. Although various public service initiatives offered in public libraries are similar to those prevalent in academic libraries, distinct variations exist which affect the overall organizational structure and operations. Likewise, internal and external issues confronting public libraries are noticeably different when compared to the academic environment. These unique characteristics of organizational design are evident throughout public libraries. Considered collectively these individual features help to define public libraries in general and distinguish them from academic organizations. Public libraries reflect, to a large degree, the communities they serve. They are usually established as a result of public law and are empowered through various legislation. Although most public libraries operate some-what independently of other government agencies, they are administered by library boards which are normally appointed or elected to serve the surrounding community. Maintained primarily by local or property taxes, public libraries also rely on a combination of state and federal funding. Theoretically, public libraries provide open access to all library users, but in actuality certain municipalities alter this practice based on individual economic needs and other fiscal considerations. © 2002 The Board of Trustees, University of Illinois.","","","","","","","","","Crisman L., Reinventing libraries: Responding to the forces of change, Reinvention of the Public Library for the 21st Century, (1998); Estabrook L.S., Lakner E., Managing Internet access: Results of a national survey, American Libraries, 31, 6, pp. 60-62, (2000); Kemp R.L., A city manager looks at trends affecting public libraries, Public Libraries, 38, 2, pp. 116-119, (1999); Raber D., Budd J.M., Public images of the role of information technology in public libraries: Alternatives and controversies, Public Libraries, 38, 3, pp. 180-186, (1999); St. Lifer E., The boomer drain: The last of a generation?, Library Journal, 125, 8, pp. 38-42, (2000); Webb T.D., Public Library Organization and Structure, (1989)","","","","","","","","","00242594","","","","English","Libr.

Although already dated in terms of its appearance, its recommendations have implications for academic librarianship which will only be fully felt and truly appreciated by the end of the century, The report is discussed in the context of British university libraries, their hnding and relationship with their parent bodies, so that its full impact can be understood. The recommendations amount to an injection of some £200 million into the system aimed at protecting traditional librarianship on the one hand and promoting the new technology on the other. The report made the radical assumption that there will be some universities which only teach and some which cany out teaching and research, supported respectively by “access” and “holdings” libraries. It foresaw no immediate change in the pattern of traditional librarianship but its discussions and recommendations on publishing, on the access, transfer and storage of information, on the all-embracing role of Information Technology, leave little room for the status quo in the RI millenium. The committee members were representative of scholarship both from within and from outside the university system with librarians clearly in the minority. The recommendations have virtually all been accepted by the Funding Councils which commissioned the report. © 1996 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

Hattori, and Company Limited","To find out a method to select important monographs and textbooks in library and information science from current publications, 1,771 book reviews for 1,183 books (about 1.5 reviews per book), appeared in 12 periodicals for the years of 1978, 1979, and 1980, were examined. The periodicals used for this study were; Journal of the American Society for Information Science, Journal of Documentation, Information Processing and Management, Aslib Proceedings, Special Libraries, Journal of Library Automation, Bulletin of the Medical Library Association, College and Research Libraries, Library Quarterly, Library Journal, Library Association Record, and Unesco Journal of Information Science, Librarianship, and Archives Administration. Some of these titles were selected by the citation counting method applied to Annual Review of Information Science and Technology and Advances in Librarianship. Others were selected by the same method applied to the top-ranking journals obtained in this primary selection. All the book reviews in these periodicals for the period were examined, recorded, and classified into 13 ranks, such as 1, 1+, -2, 2, 2+, ⋯, -5, 5. Here, 1 denotes ""a very poor book, you should not buy.""; 2 denotes ""a book you better not buy""; 3 is for ""a book that was neither good nor bad""; 4 is for ""better buy""; 5 is for ""must buy""; + or - attached to them indicates a slant toward either better or poorer respectively. A list of 48 books, that were reviewed more than 4 times, was compiled. This includes a book by F. W. Lancaster that was reviewed in 9 different periodicals. The book was followed by another book of same author and a book written by M. S. Martin. Both of them had been reviewed 7 times. Then, there were four titles with 6 reviews, 11 with 5 reviews, and 30 with 4 reviews. While, the average points of all 1,183 books was 2.32, that of these 48 books was 2.68. That is slightly better than the average. However, 19 of them had lower points than this average. Another additional list of 19 titles, that were reviewed 3 times and received higher than 4.00 point, was also compiled. Almost all of these 67 titles were listed in more than one of the following three selective lists of books and book reviews. They were, 1) ""the Librarian's Bookshelf"" of the Bowker Annual of Library and Book Trade Information ; 2) American Reference Books Annual ; and 3) ""the JAL guide to New Books and Book Reviews"" of Journal of Academic Librarianship. The present study found out that there were books that drew special attention of many people and were reviewed in many periodicals in the profession. However, all of these titles were not necessarily given favorable reviews. The works published many times as revised editions were also not necessarily given favorable reviews. But both, publishers and authors were found to be some reliable clue in judging the quality of books.","","","","","","","","","Belzer J., Et al., Curricula in information science; analysis and development, Journal of the American Society for Information Science, 22, 3, pp. 213-214, (1971); Belzer J., Et al., Curricula in information science: Four year progress report, Journal of the American Society for Information Science, 26, 1, pp. 28-31, (1975); Hsu K.-L., Diodato V.P., Library and information sciences textbooks-in-use: A master checklist, Information Reports and Bibliographies, 5, 2, pp. 35-38, (1976); Library and Information Science, 16, pp. 93-114, (1978); Belzer J., Robertson K., Key publications in information science: A selective list, Bulletin of the American Society for Information Science, 2, 8, pp. 35-38, (1976); Bobinski G.S., Notable books in library science; a preliminary list, Drexel Library Quarterly, 15, 3, pp. 50-77, (1979); Schuman P.G., Pedolsky A., Publishers of library science books and monographs, Drexel Library Quarterly, 15, 1, pp. 77-98, (1979)","","","Mita Society for Library and Information Science","","","","","","03734447","","","","Japanese","Libr.

The author considers each core competency in the context of the most important factors responsible for continuing changes in the training and retraining of reference professionals.

The Humanities Resources option on the MA Librarianship programme at the Department of Information Studies, University of Sheffield, is described. © 1989, Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.","","","","","","","","","Alston R.C., Jannetta M.J., Bibliography, Machine-Readable Cataloguing and the ESTC, (1978); Battin P., The library: Center of the restructured university, College and Research Libraries, 45, 3, pp. 170-176, (1984); Bolter J.D., Turing's Man, (1986); Booth A., Bulletin boards and libraries: The HUMBUL experience, Library Association Record, 90, 11, pp. 666-670, (1988); Booth A., Humanities Bulletin Board Experiment: Report for Period September 1986-March 1988, (1988); Brierley W., Kemble I., Computing in the humanities: Translation and the computer, The CTISS File, 7, pp. 85-90, (1988); Brindley L., The library and the electronic campus, The World of Books and Information: Essays in Honour of Lord Dainton, pp. 3-14, (1987); Case D.O., Collection and organization of written information by social scientists and humanists: A review and exploratory study, Journal of Information Science, 12, 3, pp. 97-104, (1986); Corkill C., Mann M., Information Needs in the Humanities: Two Postal Surveys, (1978); Corkill C., Mann M., Stone S., Doctoral Students in Humanities: A Small-Scale Panel Study of Information Needs and Uses 1976-79, (1981); Cox S., Rosier D., Teaching material for German as a foreign language: The database project, The CTISS File, 7, pp. 104-107, (1988); Cullars J., Characteristics of the monographic literature of British and American literary studies, College and Research Libraries, 46, 6, pp. 511-522, (1985); Derrick J., Lewis H., Workshop on programming for logic teaching, Leeds 6-8 July, 1987, The CTISS File, 5, pp. 64-65, (1988); Fabian B., Buch, Bibliothek und Geisteswissenschaftliche Forschung: Zu Problemen der Literalurversorgung und der Literaturproduklion in der Bundesrepublik Deulschland, (1983); Fabian B., Libraries and humanistic scholarship: A German perspective, German Studies: British Resources, pp. 4-15, (1986); Falk J.D., Search of history: Bibliographic databases, History- Teaching, 15, 4, pp. 523-544, (1982); Falk J.D., Computer-assisted reference service in history, RQ, 21, 4, pp. 342-344, (1982); Ferguson C.D., The librarian-historian interface in reference service (online services), RQ, 21, 4, pp. 356-360, (1982); Flood J., Financial provision for German studies in university libraries, German Studies: British Resources, pp. 84-96, (1985); Goldfinch J., Searching the ISTC on BLAISE-LINE, Bibliography and the Study of 15th-century Civilisation, pp. 12-33, (1987); Guest S.S., The use of bibliographic tools by humanities faculty at the state university of New York at Albany, The Reference Librarian, 16, pp. 157-172, (1987); Guskin A.E., Stoffle C.J., Baruth B.E., Library future shock: The microcomputer revolution and the new role of the library, College and Research Libraries, 45, 3, pp. 177-183, (1984); Haywood M., Cairns F., The learning Latin computer package: CTI Project Report from Liverpool, The CTISS File, 4, pp. 22-24, (1987); Heinzkill R., Characteristics of References in Selected Scholarly English Literary Journals.

It then will present an ovewiew of the most frequently used and requested sources of government information. It will by no means be an exhaustive list because it is aimed at the general information provider in an academic library. This general information provider may not be very familiar with federal documents and may even be afraid of them. In this world of rapidly advancing technology, documents can no longer be pushed aside or overlooked as a source of information because access has improved so much. In this overview, the many formats, including the electronic format in which many documents are now available, will also be noted. This electronic format has caused many problems to arise because of the lack of a federal information policy that is clearly defined. © 1990 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","","","","","","","","","Informing the Nation: Federal Information Dissemination in an Electronic Age, (1988); Moody M., “Twenty-Five Years of Government Information: Changes in Reference Service Attitudes, RQ, 25, (1985); Training the General Information Provider to Use Government Information, GODORT Annual Program: New Orleans, 1988,”, DTTP, 17, pp. 19-40, (1989); Moody M., RQ, 27, (1988); Mc Clure C.R., Hernon P., Improving the Quality of Reference Service for Government Publications, (1983); Andriot J.L., Guide to L/.S.

It is argued that the control of these behaviors cannot be achieved simply by increasing the efficiency of library staff or the use of security technology. Rather, “theft” and ""mutilation” arc terms which are selectively applied to essentially ambiguous events, and the librarian’s tendency not to prosecute rule-violators emerges from the interactional and institutional contexts of librarianship itself. © 1984 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

The six-week program was developed in response to the need for innovative approaches to the recruitment and retention of people of color to the academic library profession. Additionally, the program sought to support the academic achievement of minority students through involvement in research and technology training opportunities. This paper outlines the program's curriculum, performance outcomes, and challenges, and includes discussion of the need for similar programs or initiatives to be designed and implemented at other libraries. © 2003 by The Haworth Press, Inc.
